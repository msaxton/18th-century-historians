 Introduction of images into the Christian church. 
In the connection of the church and state, I have considered the former as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a salutary maxim, if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever been held sacred. The Oriental philosophy of the Gnostics, the dark abyss of predestination and grace, and the strange transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the substance of Christ's body, (1) I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of speculative divines. But I have reviewed, with diligence and pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected, the propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic church, the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation. At the head of this class, we may justly rank the worship of images, so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries; since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and the restoration of the Roman empire in the West.

 The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to the Greeks. The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity; and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people. The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been endowed with sense and motion, should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist. (2) Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane honours which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras;
 (3) but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and spiritual; and the first notice of the use of 
pictures is in the censure of the council of Illiberis, three hundred years after the Christian aera. Under the successors of Constantine, in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the  veneration of the cross, and of relics. The saints and martyrs, whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand if God; but the gracious and often supernatural favours, which, in the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of their merits and sufferings. (4) But a memorial, more interesting than the  skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the faithful copy of his person and features, delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture. In every age, such copies, so congenial to human feelings, have been cherished by the zeal
 of private friendship, or public esteem: the images of the Roman emperors were adored with civil, and almost religious, honours; a reverence less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the statues of sages and patriots; and these 
profane virtues, these splendid sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who had died for their celestial and everlasting country. Their worship.  At first, the experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes. By a slow though inevitable progression, the honours of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint; and the Pagan rites of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the Catholic church. The scruples of reason, or piety, were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a divine energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adoration. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt of defining, by forms and colours, the infinite Spirit, the eternal Father, who pervades and sustains the universe. (5)
 But the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the human shape, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume. The second person of the Trinity
 had been clothed with a real and mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven: and, had not some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples, the spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the saints. A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary: the place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the West. The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the Christian Greeks: and a smooth surface of colours has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation. (6)
 The image of Edessa. 
 The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance
 with the original; but the primitive Christians were
 ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God, his
 mother, and his apostles: the statue of Christ at Paneas in
 Palestine (7) was more probably that of some temporal saviour; the Gnostics and their profane monuments were reprobated;
 and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided
 by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model. In this
 distress, a bold and dexterous invention assured at once the
 likeness of the image and the innocence of the worship. A
 new super structure of fable was raised on the popular basis
 of a Syrian legend, on the correspondence of Christ and
 Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly
 deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea (8) records the epistle, (9) but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ; (10) the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with which he gratified the faith of the royal
 stranger who had invoked his healing power, and offered the
 strong city of Edessa to protect him against the malice of
 the Jews. The ignorance of the primitive church is
 explained by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche
 of the wall, from whence, after an oblivion of five hundred
 years, it was released by some prudent bishop, and
 seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its
 first and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the
 city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon
 revered as a pledge of the divine promise, that Edessa
 should never be taken by a foreign enemy. It is true,
 indeed, that the text of Procopius ascribes the double
 deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valour of her
 citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the
 assaults of the Persian monarch. He was ignorant, the
 profane historian, of the testimony which he is compelled to
 deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the
 Palladium was exposed on the rampart, and that the water
 which had been sprinkled on the holy face, instead of
 quenching, added new fuel to the flames of the besieged.
 After this important service, the image of Edessa was
 preserved with respect and gratitude; and if the Armenians
 rejected the legend, the more credulous Greeks adored the
 similitude, which was not the work of any mortal pencil, but
 the immediate creation of the divine original. The style and
 sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far their
 worship was removed from the grossest idolatry.  Before the end of the sixth century, these images, made without hands, (in Greek it is a single word, (11)) were propagated in the camps and cities of the Eastern empire: (12) they were the objects of worship, and the instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult, their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the courage, or repress the fury, of the Roman legions.Its copies. Of these pictures, the far greater part, the transcripts of a human pencil, could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper title: but there were some of higher descent, who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with the original, endowed, for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific virtue. The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain, or Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful precedent was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and martyrs. In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features of the Mother of God (13) were deeply inscribed in a marble column; the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke; and the Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced to exercise the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians. The Olympian Jove, created by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but these Catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius. (14)
 Opposition to image-worship. 
 The worship of images had stolen into the church by
 insensible degrees, and each petty step was pleasing to the
 superstitious mind, as productive of comfort, and innocent
 of sin. But in the beginning of the eighth century, in the
 full magnitude of the abuse, the more timorous Greeks were
 awakened by an apprehension, that under the mask of
 Christianity, they had restored the religion of their
 fathers: they heard, with grief and impatience, the name of
 idolaters; the incessant charge of the Jews and Mahometans,
 (15) who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal
 hatred to graven images and all relative worship. The
 servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal, and depreciate
 their authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned
 at Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the
 scale of reproach the accumulated weight of truth and
 victory. The cities of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had been
 fortified with the images of Christ, his mother, and his
 saints; and each city presumed on the hope or promise of
 miraculous defence. In a rapid conquest of ten years, the
 Arabs subdued those cities and these images; and, in their
 opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judgment
 between the adoration and contempt of these mute and
 inanimate idols.  For a while Edessa had braved the
 Persian assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ,
 was involved in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance
 became the slave and trophy of the infidels. After a
 servitude of three hundred years, the Palladium was yielded
 to the devotion of Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve
 thousand pounds of silver, the redemption of two hundred
 Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce for the territory of
 Edessa. (16) In this season of distress and dismay, the
 eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of
 images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism
 of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the
 favour, and annihilated the virtue, of these precious
 symbols. But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many
 simple or rational Christians, who appealed to the evidence
 of texts, of facts, and of the primitive times, and secretly
 desired the reformation of the church. As the worship of
 images had never been established by any general or positive
 law, its progress in the Eastern empire had been retarded,
 or accelerated, by the differences of men and manners, the
 local degrees of refinement, and the personal characters of
 the bishops. The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by
 the levity of the capital, and the inventive genius of the
 Byzantine clergy; while the rude and remote districts of
 Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred luxury.
 Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians maintained,
 after their conversion, the simple worship which had
 preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most
 warlike subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the
 twelfth century, to the sight of images. (17) These various
 denominations of men afforded a fund of prejudice and
 aversion, of small account in the villages of Anatolia or
 Thrace, but which, in the fortune of a soldier, a prelate,
 or a eunuch, might be often connected with the powers of the
 church and state.

 Leo the Iconoclast, and his successors, A.D. 726-840. 
 Of such adventurers, the most fortunate was the emperor Leo
 the Third, (18) who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended
 the throne of the East. He was ignorant of sacred and
 profane letters; but his education, his reason, perhaps his
 intercourse with the Jews and Arabs, had inspired the
 martial peasant with a hatred of images; and it was held to
 be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the
 dictates of his own conscience. But in the outset of an
 unsettled reign, during ten years of toil and danger, Leo
 submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy, bowed before the
 idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman pontiff
 with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In
 the reformation of religion, his first steps were moderate
 and cautious: he assembled a great council of senators and
 bishops, and enacted, with their consent, that all the
 images should be removed from the sanctuary and altar to a
 proper height in the churches where they might be visible to
 the eyes, and inaccessible to the superstition, of the
 people. But it was impossible on either side to check the
 rapid through adverse impulse of veneration and abhorrence:
 in their lofty position, the sacred images still edified
 their votaries, and reproached the tyrant. He was himself
 provoked by resistance and invective; and his own party
 accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty, and urged
 for his imitation the example of the Jewish king, who had
 broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple. By
 a second edict, he proscribed the existence as well as the
 use of religious pictures; the churches of Constantinople
 and the provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of
 Christ, the Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a
 smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the
 edifice. The sect of the Iconoclasts was supported by the
 zeal and despotism of six emperors, and the East and West
 were involved in a noisy conflict of one hundred and twenty
 years. It was the design of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce
 the condemnation of images as an article of faith, and by
 the authority of a general council: but the convocation of
 such an assembly was reserved for his son Constantine; (19)
 and though it is stigmatized by triumphant bigotry as a
 meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and
 mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety. Their synod of Constantinople, A.D. 754. The debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the
 summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of
 Constantinople, and was composed of the respectable number
 of three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of Europe and
 Anatolia; for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were
 the slaves of the caliph, and the Roman pontiff had
 withdrawn the churches of Italy and the West from the
 communion of the Greeks. This Byzantine synod assumed the
 rank and powers of the seventh general council; yet even
 this title was a recognition of the six preceding
 assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure of the
 Catholic faith. After a serious deliberation of six months,
 the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and
 subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible symbols of
 Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or
 heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of
 Christianity and a renewal of Paganism; that all such
 monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased; and that
 those who should refuse to deliver the objects of their
 private superstition, were guilty of disobedience to the
 authority of the church and of the emperor. In their loud
 and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits of their
 temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they
 intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures. At
 Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will of the
 prince was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this
 occasion, I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of
 the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the
 temptations of hope and fear. Their creed. In the long night of superstition, the Christians had wandered far away from the
 simplicity of the gospel: nor was it easy for them to
 discern the clue, and tread back the mazes, of the
 labyrinth. The worship of images was inseparably blended,
 at least to a pious fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the
 Saints and their relics; the holy ground was involved in a
 cloud of miracles and visions; and the nerves of the mind,
 curiosity and scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of
 obedience and belief. Constantine himself is accused of
 indulging a royal license to doubt, or deny, or deride the
 mysteries of the Catholics, (20) but they were deeply
 inscribed in the public and private creed of his bishops;
 and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret
 horror the monuments of popular devotion, which were
 consecrated to the honour of his celestial patrons. In the
 reformation of the sixteenth century, freedom and knowledge
 had expanded all the faculties of man: the thirst of
 innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity; and the
 vigour of Europe could disdain those phantoms which terrified
 the sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks.

 Their persecution of the images and monks, A.D. 726-775. 
 The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to
 the people by the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet; but
 the most ignorant can perceive, the most torpid must feel,
 the profanation and downfall of their visible deities. The
 first hostilities of Leo were directed against a lofty
 Christ on the vestibule, and above the gate, of the palace.
 A ladder had been planted for the assault, but it was
 furiously shaken by a crowd of zealots and women: they
 beheld, with pious transport, the ministers of sacrilege
 tumbling from on high and dashed against the pavement: and
 the honours of the ancient martyrs were prostituted to these
 criminals, who justly suffered for murder and rebellion. (21)
 The execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by
 frequent tumults in Constantinople and the provinces: the
 person of Leo was endangered, his officers were massacred,
 and the popular enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest
 efforts of the civil and military power. Of the
 Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous islands were filled
 with images and monks: their votaries abjured, without
 scruple, the enemy of Christ, his mother, and the saints;
 they armed a fleet of boats and galleys, displayed their
 consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the harbour of
 Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favourite of God
 and the people. They depended on the succour of a miracle:
 but their miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire;
 and, after the defeat and conflagration of the fleet, the
 naked islands were abandoned to the clemency or justice of
 the conqueror. The son of Leo, in the first year of his
 reign, had undertaken an expedition against the Saracens:
 during his absence, the capital, the palace, and the purple,
 were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes, the ambitious
 champion of the orthodox faith. The worship of images was
 triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced his
 dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the
 righteous claims of the usurper was acknowledged, both in
 the new, and in ancient, Rome. Constantine flew for refuge
 to his paternal mountains; but he descended at the head of
 the bold and affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory
 confounded the arms and predictions of the fanatics. His
 long reign was distracted with clamour, sedition, conspiracy,
 and mutual hatred, and sanguinary revenge; the persecution
 of images was the motive or pretence, of his adversaries;
 and, if they missed a temporal diadem, they were rewarded by
 the Greeks with the crown of martyrdom. In every act of
 open and clandestine treason, the emperor felt the
 unforgiving enmity of the monks, the faithful slaves of the
 superstition to which they owed their riches and influence.
 They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they inflamed,
 they conspired; the solitude of Palestine poured forth a
 torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus,
 (22) the last of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant's
 head, both in this world and the next. (23)  I am not at
 leisure to examine how far the monks provoked, nor how much
 they have exaggerated, their real and pretended sufferings,
 nor how many lost their lives or limbs, their eyes or their
 beards, by the cruelty of the emperor.  From the
 chastisement of individuals, he proceeded to the abolition
 of the order; and, as it was wealthy and useless, his
 resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and justified by
 patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the Dragon,
 (24) his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence
 of the black nation: the religious communities were
 dissolved, the buildings were converted into magazines, or
 bar racks; the lands, movables, and cattle were confiscated;
 and our modern precedents will support the charge, that much
 wanton or malicious havoc was exercised against the relics,
 and even the books of the monasteries. With the habit and
 profession of monks, the public and private worship of
 images was rigorously proscribed; and it should seem, that a
 solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted from the subjects,
 or at least from the clergy, of the Eastern empire. (25)
 State of Italy. 
 The patient East abjured, with reluctance, her sacred
 images; they were fondly cherished, and vigorously defended,
 by the independent zeal of the Italians. In ecclesiastical
 rank and jurisdiction, the patriarch of Constantinople and
 the pope of Rome were nearly equal. But the Greek prelate
 was a domestic slave under the eye of his master, at whose
 nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne,
 and from the throne to the convent. A distant and dangerous
 station, amidst the Barbarians of the West, excited the
 spirit and freedom of the Latin bishops. Their popular
 election endeared them to the Romans: the public and private
 indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and the
 weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to
 consult, both in peace and war, the temporal safety of the
 city. In the school of adversity the priest insensibly
 imbibed the virtues and the ambition of a prince; the same
 character was assumed, the same policy was adopted, by the
 Italian, the Greek, or the Syrian, who ascended the chair of
 St. Peter; and, after the loss of her legions and provinces,
 the genius and fortune of the popes again restored the
 supremacy of Rome. It is agreed, that in the eighth
 century, their dominion was founded on rebellion, and that
 the rebellion was produced, and justified, by the heresy of
 the Iconoclasts; but the conduct of the second and third
 Gregory, in this memorable contest, is variously interpreted
 by the wishes of their friends and enemies. The Byzantine
 writers unanimously declare, that, after a fruitless
 admonition, they pronounced the separation of the East and
 West, and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue
 and sovereignty of Italy. Their excommunication is still
 more clearly expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the
 accomplishment of the papal triumphs; and as they are more
 strongly attached to their religion than to their country,
 they praise, instead of blaming, the zeal and orthodoxy of
 these apostolical men. (26) The modern champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the precedent: this great and
 glorious example of the deposition of royal heretics is
 celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine; (27) and
 if they are asked, why the same thunders were not hurled
 against the Neros and Julians of antiquity, they reply, that
 the weakness of the primitive church was the sole cause of
 her patient loyalty. (28) On this occasion the effects of
 love and hatred are the same; and the zealous Protestants,
 who seek to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the fears,
 of princes and magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and
 treason of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign.
 (29) They are defended only by the moderate Catholics, for the most part, of the Gallican church, (30) who respect the
 saint, without approving the sin. These common advocates of
 the crown and the mitre circumscribe the truth of facts by
 the rule of equity, Scripture, and tradition, and appeal to
 the evidence of the Latins, (31) and the lives (32) and
 epistles of the popes themselves.

 Epistles of Gregory II. To the emperor, A.D. 727. 
Two original epistles, from Gregory the Second to the emperor Leo, are still extant; (33) and if they cannot be praised as the most perfect models of eloquence and logic, they exhibit the portrait, or at least the mask, of the  founder of the papal monarchy.  After this decent salutation, the pope attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images. The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons, at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any visible likeness. The latter are the genuine forms of Christ, his mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd of miracles, the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A more specious argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general council; and Gregory frankly confesses, than such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox
 prince. To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a
 heretic, he recommends peace, silence, and implicit
 obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople and
 Rome. The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are
 defined by the pontiff. To the former he appropriates the
 body; to the latter, the soul: the sword of justice is in
 the hands of the magistrate: the more formidable weapon of
 excommunication is intrusted to the clergy; and in the
 exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not
 spare his offending father: the successor of St. Peter may
 lawfully chastise the kings of the earth. 
 "You assault us, O tyrant! with a carnal and military hand: unarmed and naked we can only implore the Christ, the prince of the heavenly  host, that he will send unto you a devil, for the  destruction of your body and the salvation of your soul. You  declare, with foolish arrogance, I will despatch my orders  to Rome: I will break in pieces the image of St. Peter; and  Gregory, like his predecessor Martin, shall be transported in chains, and in exile, to the foot of the Imperial throne. Would to God that I might be permitted to tread in the footsteps of the holy Martin! but may the fate of Constans serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church! After
 his just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant
 was cut off, in the fullness of his sins, by a domestic
 servant: the saint is still adored by the nations of
 Scythia, among whom he ended his banishment and his life.
 But it is our duty to live for the edification and support
 of the faithful people; nor are we reduced to risk our
safety on the event of a combat. Incapable as you are of defending your Roman subjects, the maritime situation of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to the distance of four-and-twenty stadia, (34) to the first fortress of the Lombards, and then - you may pursue the winds. Are you ignorant that the popes are the bond of union, the mediators of peace, between the East and West? The eyes of the nations are fixed on our humility; and they revere, as a God upon earth, the apostle St. Peter, whose image you threaten to destroy. (35) The remote and interior kingdoms of the West present their homage to Christ and his vicegerent; and we now prepare to visit one of their most
powerful monarchs, who desires to receive from our hands the sacrament of baptism. (36) The Barbarians have submitted to the yoke of the gospel, while you alone are deaf to the voice of the shepherd. These pious Barbarians are kindled into rage: they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East. Abandon your rash and fatal enterprise; reflect, tremble, and repent. If you persist, we are innocent of the blood that will be spilt in the contest; may it fall on your own head!"
Revolt of Italy, A.D. 728, etc. 
 The first assault of Leo against the images of
 Constantinople had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers
 from Italy and the West, who related with grief and
 indignation the sacrilege of the emperor. But on the
 reception of his proscriptive edict, they trembled for their
 domestic deities: the images of Christ and the Virgin, of
 the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all the
 churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to
 the Roman pontiff, the royal favour as the price of his
 compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his
 disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to
 hesitate; and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed
 the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his
 doctrine or the powers of resistance. Without depending on
 prayers or miracles, he boldly armed against the public
 enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of
 their danger and their duty. (37) At this signal, Ravenna,
 Venice, and the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis,
 adhered to the cause of religion; their military force by
 sea and land consisted, for the most part, of the natives;
 and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into
 the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to live and die
 in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman
 people was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards
 were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy
 war. The most treasonable act, but the most obvious
 revenge, was the destruction of the statues of Leo himself:
 the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion, was
 the withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him of a
 power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a
 new capitation. (38) A form of administration was preserved
 by the election of magistrates and governors; and so high
 was the public indignation, that the Italians were prepared
 to create an orthodox emperor, and to conduct him with a
 fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople. In that
 palace, the Roman bishops, the second and third Gregory,
 were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and every
 attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their
 persons, and to strike at their lives. The city was
 repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards,
 and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they
 landed with foreign troops, they obtained some domestic aid,
 and the superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers
 were attached to the cause of heresy. But these clandestine
 or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance
 of the Romans; the Greeks were overthrown and massacred,
 their leaders suffered an ignominious death, and the popes,
 however inclined to mercy, refused to intercede for these
 guilty victims. At Ravenna, (39) the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud; in
 religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction:
 but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or
 spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent,
 lost his life in a popular sedition. To punish this
 flagitious deed, and restore his dominion in Italy, the
 emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic Gulf. After
 suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay, the
 Greeks made their descent in the neighbourhood of Ravenna:
 they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital, and to
 imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of Justinian the
 Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice
 and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The
 women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in
 prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their
 country; the common danger had united the factions, and the
 event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a
 siege. In a hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately
 yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard,
 and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory. The
 strangers retreated to their ships, but the populous
 sea-coast poured forth a multitude of boats; the waters of
 the Po were so deeply infected with blood, that during six
 years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the
 river; and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated
 the worship of images, and the abhorrence of the Greek
 tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the Roman
 pontiff convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against the
 heresy of the Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was
 tacitly involved, (40) but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet
 suspended over his guilty head. No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a master; and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne, the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine. (41)
Republic of Rome. 
 The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms
 and arts of Augustus, was rescued, after seven hundred and
 fifty years of servitude, from the persecution of Leo the
 Isaurian. By the Caesars, the triumphs of the consuls had
 been annihilated: in the decline and fall of the empire, the
 god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had insensibly receded
 from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates;
 and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo
 to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth of the Tyber. (42) When the kings were banished, the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and
 virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a well-proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the arts of luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the rights of individuals were
 sacred: one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory. (43) When the sovereignty of the Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious Barbarians. As often as the Franks or
 Lombards expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe, they
 called him a Roman; 
"and in this name," says the bishop Liutprand, "we include whatever is base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes of avarice and luxury, and every vice that can prostitute the dignity
 of human nature." (44) 
 By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model of a republican government: they were compelled to
 elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the
 nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not
 be executed without the union and consent of the multitude.
 The style of the Roman senate and people was revived, (45)
 but the spirit was fled; and their new independence was
 disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and
 oppression. The want of laws could only be supplied by the
 influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic
 counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop. His
 alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and
 prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude,
 and oath, accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first
 magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian humility of
 the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord;
 and their face and inscription are still apparent on the
 most ancient coins. (46) Their temporal dominion is now
 confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years; and their
 noblest title is the free choice of a people, whom they had
 redeemed from slavery.

Rome attacked by the Lombards, A.D. 730-752 . 
 In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of Elis
 enjoyed a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter,
 and in the exercise of the Olympic games. (47) Happy would it
 have been for the Romans, if a similar privilege had guarded
 the patrimony of St. Peter from the calamities of war; if
 the Christians, who visited the holy threshold, would have
 sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his
 successor. But this mystic circle could have been traced
 only by the wand of a legislator and a sage: this pacific
 system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the
 popes the Romans were not addicted, like the inhabitants of
 Elis, to the innocent and placid labours of agriculture; and
 the Barbarians of Italy, though softened by the climate,
 were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of
 public and private life. A memorable example of repentance
 and piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards.
 In arms, at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened
 to the voice of Gregory the Second, (48) withdrew his troops,
 resigned his conquests, respectfully visited the church of
 St. Peter, and after performing his devotions, offered his
 sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his silver cross,
 and his crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle. But this
 religious fervour was the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of
 the moment; the sense of interest is strong and lasting; the
 love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards; and
 both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted by the
 disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the unwarlike
 profession of her new chief. On the first edicts of the
 emperor, they declared themselves the champions of the holy
 images: Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna, which had
 already assumed that distinctive appellation; the Catholics
 of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance to his civil and
 military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the
 first time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna. That
 city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active
 diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians; and those
 faithful subjects obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself,
 in separating the personal guilt of Leo from the general
 cause of the Roman empire. (49) The Greeks were less mindful of the service, than the Lombards of the injury: the two
 nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a
 dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch
 marched to the conquest of Spoleto and Rome: the storm
 evaporated without effect, but the policy of Liutprand
 alarmed Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and
 truce. His successor Astolphus declared himself the equal
 enemy of the emperor and the pope: Ravenna was subdued by
 force or treachery, (50) and this final conquest extinguished
 the series of the exarchs, who had reigned with a
 subordinate power since the time of Justinian and the ruin
 of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was summoned to acknowledge the
 victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign; the annual
 tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each
 citizen, and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to
 exact the penalty of her disobedience. The Romans
 hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the
 threatening Barbarians were checked by arms and
 negotiations, till the popes had engaged the friendship of
 an ally and avenger beyond the Alps. (51)
Her deliverance by Pepin, A.D. 754 . 
 In his distress, the first  Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the
 French monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and
 who, by his signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his
 country, and perhaps Europe, from the Mahometan yoke. The
 ambassadors of the pope were received by Charles with decent
 reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and the
 shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the
 affairs of Italy, except by a friendly and ineffectual
 mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of his power and
 virtues, assumed the office of champion of the Roman church;
 and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been
 prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger
 was on the banks of the Tyber, the succour on those of the
 Seine, and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant
 misery. Amidst the tears of the city, Stephen the Third
 embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person the
 courts of Lombardy and France, to deprecate the injustice of
 his enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his
 friend. After soothing the public despair by litanies and
 orations, he undertook this laborious journey with the
 ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek emperor.
 The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his threats
 could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of
 the Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed
 in the abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right
 hand of his protector; a hand which was never lifted in
 vain, either in war or friendship. Stephen was entertained
 as the visible successor of the apostle; at the next
 assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were
 exposed to a devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the
 Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror, at the head of
 a French army, which was led by the king in person. The
 Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an ignominious
 peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to respect
 the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was
 Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms,
 than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome
 was again encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive
 of fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his
 complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and
 person of St. Peter himself. (52) The apostle assures his
 adopted sons, the king, the clergy, and the nobles of
 France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in the
 spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the
 founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the Virgin,
 the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of
 heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the
 obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown
 their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be
 the penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his
 temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of the
 perfidious Lombards. The second expedition of Pepin was not
 less rapid and fortunate than the first: St. Peter was
 satisfied, Rome was again saved, and Astolphus was taught
 the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a
 foreign master. After this double chastisement, the
 Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor
 and decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their
 condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of
 the feeble, they peevishly harassed the Romans with a
 repetition of claims, evasions, and inroads, which they
 undertook without reflection, and terminated without glory.
 On either side, their expiring monarchy was pressed by the
 zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the First, the genius, the
 fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the son of Pepin;
 these heroes of the church and state were united in public
 and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the
 prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest
 colours of equity and moderation. (53) The passes of the Alps,
 and the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the
 Lombards; Conquest of Lombardy by Charlemagne, A.D. 774 .the former were surprised, the latter were
 invested, by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of two
 years,  Desiderius, the last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his capital. Under the dominion
 of a foreign king, but in the possession of their national
 laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather than the
 subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and
 manners, and language, from the same Germanic origin. (54)
Pepin and Charlemagne, Kings of France, A.D. 751. 753. 768. 
 The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesiastical, history. In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the Roman church obtained a favourable
 occasion, a specious title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy. But the most essential gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France, (55) and of patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St. Peter, the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title, was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his valour; his friends were
 multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the saviour of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four generations. The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his
 family. The mayor and the nobles were bound, by an oath of
 fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood of Clovis was pure
 and sacred in their eyes; and their common ambassadors
 addressed the Roman pontiff, to dispel their scruples, or to
 absolve their promise. The interest of Pope Zachary, the
 successor of the two Gregories, prompted him to decide, and
 to decide in their favour: he pronounced that the nation
 might lawfully unite in the same person the title and
 authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a
 victim of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and
 confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days. An
 answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the
 Franks as the opinion of a casuist, the sentence of a judge,
 or the oracle of a prophet: the Merovingian race disappeared
 from the earth; and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the
 suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and
 to march under his standard. His coronation was twice
 performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their most
 faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and
 by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, who, in the
 monastery of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his
 benefactor. The royal unction of the kings of Israel was
 dexterously applied: (56) the successor of St. Peter assumed
 the character of a divine ambassador: a German chieftain was
 transformed into the Lord's anointed; and this Jewish rite
 has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and
 vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were absolved from their
 ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered against them
 and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same
 freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy
 and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes. Without
 apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in
 their present security: the secretary of Charlemagne
 affirms, that the French sceptre was transferred by the
 authority of the popes; (57) and in their boldest
 enterprises, they insist, with confidence, on this signal
 and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.

Patricians of Rome. 
 II. In the change of manners and language the patricians of
 Rome (58) were far removed from the senate of Romulus, on the palace of Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic,
 or the fictitious parents of the emperor. After the
 recovery of Italy and Africa by the arms of Justinian, the
 importance and danger of those remote provinces required the
 presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently
 styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of
 Ravenna, who fill their place in the chronology of princes,
 extended their jurisdiction over the Roman city. Since the
 revolt of Italy and the loss of the Exarchate, the distress
 of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice of their
 independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the
 right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the
 senate and people successively invested Charles Martel and
 his posterity with the honours of patrician of Rome. The
 leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile
 title and subordinate office; but the reign of the Greek
 emperors was suspended; and, in the vacancy of the empire,
 they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and
 the republic. The Roman ambassadors presented these
 patricians with the keys of the shrine of St. Peter, as a
 pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner which
 it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the
 church and city. (59) In the time of Charles Martel and of
 Pepin, the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the
 freedom, while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the
 patriciate represented only the title, the service, the
 alliance, of these distant protectors. The power and policy
 of Charlemagne annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master.
 In his first visit to the capital, he was received with all
 the honours which had formerly been paid to the exarch, the
 representative of the emperor; and these honours obtained
 some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of Pope
 Adrian the First. (60) No sooner was he informed of the
 sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the
 magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with the banner,
 about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of one
 mile, the Flaminian way was lined with the schools, or
 national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, etc.: the
 Roman youth were under arms; and the children of a more
 tender age, with palms and olive branches in their hands,
 chanted the praises of their great deliverer. At the aspect
 of the holy crosses, and ensigns of the saints, he
 dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his nobles
 to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly
 kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles. In the
 portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his clergy: they
 embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march to the
 altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the
 pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty
 demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years that
 elapsed between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial
 coronation, Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was
 subject, as his own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The
 people swore allegiance to his person and family: in his
 name money was coined, and justice was administered; and the
 election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his
 authority. Except an original and self-inherent claim of
 sovereignty, there was not any prerogative remaining, which
 the title of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome. (61)
Donations of Pepin and Charlemagne to the popes .  
 The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these
 obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviours
 and benefactors of the Roman church. Her ancient patrimony
 of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the
 temporal dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation
 of the Exarchate was the first-fruits of the conquests of
 Pepin. (62) Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the
 keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered
 to the French ambassador; and, in his master's name, he
 presented them before the tomb of St. Peter. The ample
 measure of the Exarchate (63) might comprise all the
 provinces of Italy which had obeyed the emperor and his
 vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were included
 in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its
 inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched
 along the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced into
 the midland- country as far as the ridges of the Apennine.
 In this transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes
 have been severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a
 Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom,
 which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing
 the virtues of his profession. Perhaps a faithful subject,
 or even a generous enemy, would have been less impatient to
 divide the spoils of the Barbarian; and if the emperor had
 intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the restitution of
 the Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach
 of treachery and falsehood. But in the rigid interpretation
 of the laws, every one may accept, without injury, whatever
 his benefactor can bestow without injustice. The Greek
 emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the
 Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the
 stronger sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the cause
 of the Iconoclast that Pepin has exposed his person and army
 in a double expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and
 might lawfully alienate, his conquests: and to the
 importunities of the Greeks he piously replied that no human
 consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he
 had conferred on the Roman Pontiff for the remission of his
 sins, and the salvation of his soul. The splendid donation
 was granted in supreme and absolute dominion, and the world
 beheld for the first time a Christian bishop invested with
 the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice of
 magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of
 taxes, and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the
 dissolution of the Lombard kingdom, the inhabitants of the
 duchy of Spoleto (64) sought a refuge from the storm, shaved
 their heads after the Roman fashion, declared themselves the
 servants and subjects of St. Peter, and completed, by this
 voluntary surrender, the present circle of the
 ecclesiastical state. That mysterious circle was enlarged
 to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or written donation
 of Charlemagne, (65) who, in the first transports of his
 victory, despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the
 cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the
 Exarchate. But, in the cooler moments of absence and
 reflection, he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the
 recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally. The execution
 of his own and his father's promises was respectfully
 eluded: the king of the Franks and Lombards asserted the
 inalienable rights of the empire; and, in his life and
 death, Ravenna, (66) as well as Rome, was numbered in the
 list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the
 Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes; they found
 in the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic
 rival: (67) the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a
 priest; and in the disorders of the times, they could only
 retain the memory of an ancient claim, which, in a more
 prosperous age, they have revived and realized.

Forgery of the donation of Constantine . 
 Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the
 strong, though ignorant, Barbarian was often entangled in
 the net of sacerdotal policy. The Vatican and Lateran were
 an arsenal and manufacture, which, according to the
 occasion, have produced or concealed a various collection of
 false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious, acts, as they
 tended to promote the interest of the Roman church. Before
 the end of the eighth century, some apostolic scribe,
 perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the decretals, and
 the donation of Constantine, the two magic pillars of the
 spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes. This
 memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle
 of Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the
 liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine.
 (68) According to the legend, the first of the Christian
 emperors was healed of the leprosy, and purified in the
 waters of baptism, by St. Silvester, the Roman bishop; and
 never was physician more gloriously recompensed. His royal
 proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St. Peter;
 declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the
 East; and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual
 sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the provinces of the West.
 (69) This fiction was productive of the most beneficial
 effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt of
 usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his
 lawful inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt
 of gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians
 were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a
 scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state. The sovereignty
 of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people;
 and the successors of St. Peter and Constantine were
 invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times, that
 the most absurd of fables was received, with equal
 reverence, in Greece and in France, and is still enrolled
 among the decrees of the canon law. (70) The emperors, and
 the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery, that
 subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition
 proceeded from a Sabine monastery, which, in the beginning
 of the twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of
 the donation of Constantine. (71) In the revival of letters
 and liberty, this fictitious deed was transpierced by the
 pen of Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a
 Roman patriot. (72) His contemporaries of the fifteenth
 century were astonished at his sacrilegious boldness; yet
 such is the silent and irresistible progress of reason,
 that, before the end of the next age, the fable was rejected
 by the contempt of historians (73) and poets, (74) and the
 tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the Roman
 church. (75) The popes themselves have indulged a smile at
 the credulity of the vulgar; (76) but a false and obsolete
 title still sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune
 which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles,
 the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been
 undermined.

Restoration of images in the East by the empress Irene, A.D. 780, etc . 
 While the popes established in Italy their freedom and
 dominion, the images, the first cause of their revolt, were
 restored in the Eastern empire. (77) Under the reign of
 Constantine the Fifth, the union of civil and ecclesiastical
 power had overthrown the tree, without extirpating the root,
 of superstition. The idols (for such they were now held)
 were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone
 to devotion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females
 obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of
 man. Leo the Fourth maintained with less rigour the religion
 of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair and
 ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the
 heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their
 ancestors. During the life of her husband, these sentiments
 were inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could
 only labor to protect and promote some favourite monks whom
 she drew from their caverns, and seated on the metropolitan
 thrones of the East. But as soon as she reigned in her own
 name and that of her son, Irene more seriously undertook the
 ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the first step of her future
 persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience.
 In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were
 exposed to the public veneration; a thousand legends were
 inverted of their sufferings and miracles. By the
 opportunities of death or removal, the episcopal seats were
 judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or
 celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of
 their sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius
 gave Irene the patriarch of Constantinople, and the command
 of the Oriental church. But the decrees of a general
 council could only be repealed by a similar assembly: (78)
 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in possession,
 and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops
 was reechoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers
 and people of Constantinople. VIIth general council, IInd of Nice, A.D. 787, Sept. 24-Oct. 23 .The delay and intrigues of a
 year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the
 choice of Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these
 obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again, after the
 Greek fashion, in the hands of the prince. No more than
 eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this
 important work: the Iconoclasts appeared, not as judges, but
 as criminals or penitents: the scene was decorated by the
 legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern patriarchs, (79) the
 decrees were framed by the president Taracius, and ratified
 by the acclamations and subscriptions of three hundred and
 fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the
 worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to
 the fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate
 whether that worship be relative or direct; whether the
 Godhead, and the figure of Christ, be entitled to the same
 mode of adoration. Of this second Nicene council the acts
 are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and
 ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I shall only notice the
 judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of
 image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a truce
 with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting
 his daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His
 scruples prompted him to consult the abbot. 
 "Rather than abstain from adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy images, it would be better for you," replied the casuist, "to enter every brothel, and visit every prostitute, in the
 city." (80)
Final establishment of images by the empress Theodora, A.D. 842
 For the honour of orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who convened the two councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons. The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her friends. During the five succeeding reigns, a period of thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated rage and various success, between the worshippers and the breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events. Nicephorus
 allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed the character of Michael the First, but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. In the purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were condemned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor, the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties; and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly
 against them; and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were
 exasperated and punished by the public hatred. After the
 death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was
 achieved by a second female, his widow Theodora, whom he
 left the guardian of the empire. Her measures were bold and
 decisive. The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the
 fame and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of
 the Iconoclast patriarch was commuted from the loss of his
 eyes to a whipping of two hundred lashes: the bishops
 trembled, the monks shouted, and the festival of orthodoxy
 preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images. A
 single question yet remained, whether they are endowed with
 any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the
 Greeks of the eleventh century; (81) and as this opinion has
 the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised
 that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative.
 In the West, Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced
 the decrees of the Nicene assembly, which is now revered by
 the Catholics as the seventh in rank of the general
 councils. Rome and Italy were docile to the voice of their
 father; but the greatest part of the Latin Christians were
 far behind in the race of superstition. Reluctance of the Franks and Charlemagne, A.D. 794, etc . The churches of
 France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle course
 between the adoration and the destruction of images, which
 they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship,
 but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history. An
 angry book of controversy was composed and published in the
 name of Charlemagne: (82) under his authority a synod of
 three hundred bishops was assembled at Frankfort: (83) they
 blamed the fury of the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a
 more severe censure against the superstition of the Greeks,
 and the decrees of their pretended council, which was long
 despised by the Barbarians of the West. (84) Among them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible
 progress; but a large atonement is made for their hesitation
 and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede
 the reformation, and of the countries, both in Europe and
 America, which are still immersed in the gloom of
 superstition.

Final separation of the popes from the Eastern empire, A.D. 774-800. 
 It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the
 pious Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of
 Rome and Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less
 orthodox Charlemagne. They were compelled to choose between
 the rival nations: religion was not the sole motive of their
 choice; and while they dissembled the failings of their
 friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the
 Catholic virtues of their foes. The difference of language
 and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals;
 and they were alienated from each other by the hostile
 opposition of seventy years. In that schism the Romans had
 tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their
 submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a
 jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the
 impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court.
 The Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not
 restored the Calabrian estates (85) and the Illyrian diocese,
 (86) which the Iconociasts had torn away from the successors
 of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence
 of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this
 practical heresy. (87) The Greeks were now orthodox; but
 their religion might be tainted by the breath of the
 reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious; but a
 discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion,
 from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of
 Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his
 scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the
 temper of a statesman, to the various practice of France and
 Italy. In his four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he
 embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety;
 knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of
 the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers
 and processions of the Roman liturgy. Would prudence or
 gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?
 Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had
 they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of
 patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne;
 and it was only by reviving the Western empire that they
 could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.
 By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the
 claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial
 town, the majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin
 Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their
 ancient metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would
 receive their crown from the successors of St. Peter. The
 Roman church would acquire a zealous and respectable
 advocate; and, under the shadow of the Carlovingian power,
 the bishop might exercise, with honour and safety, the
 government of the city. (88)
Coronation of Charlemagne as emperor of Rome and of the West, A.D. 800, Dec. 25 . 
 Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome, the competition for a
 wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and
 bloodshed. The people was less numerous, but the times were
 more savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St.
 Peter was fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who
 aspired to the rank of sovereign. The reign of Adrian the
 First (89) surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages;
 (90) the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the
 Lombards, and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the
 trophies of his fame: he secretly edified the throne of his
 successors, and displayed in a narrow space the virtues of a
 great prince. His memory was revered; but in the next
 election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was
 preferred to the nephew and the favourite of Adrian, whom he
 had promoted to the first dignities of the church. Their
 acquiescence or repentance disguised, above four years, the
 blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a procession,
 when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed
 multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred
 person of the pope. But their enterprise on his life or
 liberty was disappointed, perhaps by their own confusion and
 remorse. Leo was left for dead on the ground: on his revival
 from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood, he
 recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was
 improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and
 tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by
 the knife of the assassins. (91) From his prison he escaped
 to the Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue,
 Charlemagne sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of
 Paderborn in Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from
 the Roman pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission
 of counts and bishops, the guards of his safety and the
 judges of his innocence; and it was not without reluctance,
 that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing
 year the personal discharge of this pious office. In his
 fourth and last pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the
 due honours of king and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge
 himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge: his
 enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious attempt against
 his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty
 of exile. On the festival of Christmas, the last year of
 the eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the church of
 St. Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had
 exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a
 patrician. (92) After the celebration of the holy mysteries,
 Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, (93) and
 the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, 
 "Long life and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus,
 crowned by God the great and pacific emperor of the Romans!" 
  The head and body of Charlemagne were consecrated by the
 royal unction: after the example of the Caesars, he was
 saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation oath
 represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of
 the church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich
 offerings to the shrine of his apostle. In his familiar
 conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the
 intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his
 absence on that memorable day. But the preparations of the
 ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of
 Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had
 acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his
 ambition, and a Roman synod had pronounced, that it was the
 only adequate reward of his merit and services. (94)
Reign and character of Charlemagne, A.D. 768-814 . 
 The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and
 sometimes deserved; but CHARLEMAGNE is the only prince in
 whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended with the
 name. That name, with the addition of saint, is inserted in
 the Roman calendar; and the saint, by a rare felicity, is
 crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers
 of an enlightened age. (95) His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from
 which he emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is
 likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison; and the ruins of
 Palmyra derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the
 surrounding desert. Without injustice to his fame, I may
 discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the
 restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues,
 chastity is not the most conspicuous: (96) but the public
 happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives
 or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or more
 transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he
 bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and licentious
 manners of his daughters, (97) whom the father was suspected
 of loving with too fond a passion.  I shall be scarcely
 permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a
 day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman,
 the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the four thousand
 five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot,
 would have something to allege against the justice and
 humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished
 Saxons (98) was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws
 were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the
 discussion of his motives, whatever is subtracted from
 bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary reader is
 amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his
 subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden
 presence, at the moment when they believed him at the most
 distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor
 summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy
 cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the
 geography of his expeditions.  But this activity was a
 national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life
 of a Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in
 military adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were
 distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more
 important purpose. His military renown must be tried by the
 scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions.
 Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two
 heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name,
 their examples, and the companions of their victories. At
 the head of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed
 the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of
 confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever
 encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or
 in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with
 the arts of peace; but his campaigns are not illustrated by
 any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success; and
 he might behold, with envy, the Saracen trophies of his
 grandfather. After the Spanish expedition, his rear-guard
 was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and the soldiers,
 whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was
 useless, might accuse, with their last breath, the want of
 skill or caution of their general. (99) I touch with
 reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a
 respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series,
 of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of
 abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his
 farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his
 eggs. He wished to improve the laws and the character of
 the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and imperfect,
 are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the times
 were suspended or mollified by his government; (100) but in
 his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and
 the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives himself
 for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of
 his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated
 the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his
 sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole constitution
 was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and
 despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the
 clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with
 temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction; and his son Lewis,
 when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops, might
 accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his father. His
 laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons
 had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had
 been the cause of the last scarcity. (101) The literary
 merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of
 schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were
 published in his name, and his familiar connection with the
 subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to
 educate both the prince and people. His own studies were
 tardy, laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and
 understood Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from
 conversation, rather than from books; and, in his mature
 age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing,
 which every peasant now learns in his infancy. (102) The
 grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times,
 were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but
 the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its
 improvement, and the encouragement of learning reflects the
 purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of
 Charlemagne. (103) The dignity of his person, (104) the length
 of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his
 government, and the reverence of distant nations,
 distinguish him from the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new
 aera from his restoration of the Western empire.

Extent of his empire. 
 That empire was not unworthy of its title; (105) and some of
 the fairest kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or
 conquest of a prince, who reigned at the same time in
 France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary. (106)
France. I. The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into the name
 and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the Merovingian
 line, its limits were contracted by the independence of the
 Britons and the revolt of Aquitain. Charlemagne pursued, and
 confined, the Britons on the shores of the ocean; and that
 ferocious tribe, whose origin and language are so different
 from the French, was chastised by the imposition of tribute,
 hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive contest, the
 rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the
 forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their
 lives. Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of
 ambitious governors, who had too faithfully copied the
 mayors of the palace. But a recent discovery (107) has
 proved that these unhappy princes were the last and lawful
 heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger
 branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the Merovingian
 house. Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of
 Gascogne, to the counties of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at the
 foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the
 beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving
 their Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the
 injustice, or the favours, of a third dynasty. By the
 reunion of Aquitain, France was enlarged to its present
 boundaries, with the additions of the Netherlands and Spain,
 as far as the Rhine. Spain . II. The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father of Charlemagne;
 but they still possessed the greatest part of SPAIN, from
 the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst their civil
 divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his
 protection in the diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook
 the expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction
 of faith, impartially crushed the resistance of the
 Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services of the
 Mahometans. In his absence he instituted the Spanish march,
 (108) which extended from the Pyrenees to the River Ebro:
 Barcelona was the residence of the French governor: he
 possessed the counties of Rousillon and Catalonia; and the
 infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were subject to his
 jurisdiction. III. Italy .As king of the Lombards, and patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of ITALY, (109) a
 tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of
 Calabria. The duchy of Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had
 spread, at the expense of the Greeks, over the modern
 kingdom of Naples. But Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused
 to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the
 independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the
 Carlovingian monarchy. His defence was firm, his submission
 was not inglorious, and the emperor was content with an easy
 tribute, the demolition of his fortresses, and the
 acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord. The artful
 flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of
 father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and
 Benventum insensibly escaped from the French yoke. (110) IV. Germany .Charlemagne was the first who united GERMANY under the same
 sceptre. The name of  Oriental France is preserved in the
 circle of Franconia; and the people of Hesse and Thuringia
 were recently incorporated with the victors, by the
 conformity of religion and government. The Alemanni, so
 formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals and
 confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed
 within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland.
 The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and
 manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated
 treasons of Tasillo justified the abolition of their
 hereditary dukes; and their power was shared among the
 counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier. But
 the north of Germany, from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe,
 was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of
 thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the yoke of
 Christ and of Charlemagne. The idols and their votaries
 were extirpated: the foundation of eight bishoprics, of
 Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen,
 Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side
 of the Weser, the bounds of ancient Saxony these episcopal
 seats were the first schools and cities of that savage land;
 and the religion and humanity of the children atoned, in
 some degree, for the massacre of the parents. Beyond the
 Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and
 various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of
 Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of
 obedience have tempted the French historian to extend the
 empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or
 conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but
 the first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be
 justly ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. Hungary . He
 retaliated on the Avars, or Huns of Pannonia, the same
 calamities which they had inflicted on the nations. Their
 rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their
 districts and villages, were broken down by the triple
 effort of a French army, that was poured into their country
 by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and
 along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of
 eight years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by
 the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the
 nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left
 desolate and unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two
 hundred and fifty years, enriched the victorious troops, or
 decorated the churches of Italy and Gaul. (111) After the
 reduction of Pannonia, the empire of Charlemagne was bounded
 only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the
 Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were
 an easy, though unprofitable, accession; and it was an
 effect of his moderation, that he left the maritime cities
 under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks. But
 these distant possessions added more to the reputation than
 to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he risk any
 ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians from
 their vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of
 communication between the rivers, the Saone and the Meuse,
 the Rhine and the Danube, were faintly attempted. (112) Their
 execution would have vivified the empire; and more cost and
 labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral. 
His neighbours and enemies . 
 If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it
 will be seen that the empire of the Franks extended, between
 east and west, from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula; between
 the north and south, from the duchy of Beneventum to the
 River Eyder, the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark.
 The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was
 magnified by the distress and division of the rest of
 Europe. The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were
 disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin:
 and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian and Gothic
 kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow
 range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns
 revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch,
 implored the honour and support of his alliance, and styled
 him their common parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the
 West. (113) He maintained a more equal intercourse with the
 caliph Harun al Rashid, (114) whose dominion stretched from
 Africa to India, and accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a
 water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy
 Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive the private
 friendship of a Frank and an Arab, who were strangers to
 each other's person, and language, and religion: but their
 public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their
 remote situation left no room for a competition of interest.
 Two thirds of the Western empire of Rome were subject to
 Charlemagne, and the deficiency was amply supplied by his
 command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of
 Germany. But in the choice of his enemies,  we may be
 reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty
 of the north to the riches of the south. The
 three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods
 and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the
 amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from
 Italy and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the
 Greeks would have insured an easy victory; and the holy
 crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by
 glory and revenge, and loudly justified by religion and
 policy. Perhaps, in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and the
 Elbe, he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the
 Roman empire, to disarm the enemies of civilized society,
 and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations. But it has
 been wisely observed, that, in a light of precaution, all
 conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be universal,
 since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger
 sphere of hostility. (115) The subjugation of Germany
 withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent
 or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and
 awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The
 fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian
 tyrant to their brethren of the North; the Ocean and
 Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets; and
 Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of
 the Normans, who, in less than seventy years, precipitated
 the fall of his race and monarchy.

His successors. A.D. 814-887 in Italy; 911 in Germany; 987 in France . 
 Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive
 constitution, the titles of emperor and Augustus were
 conferred on Charlemagne for the term of his life; and his
 successors, on each vacancy, must have ascended the throne
 by a formal or tacit election. But the association of his
 son Lewis the Pious asserts the independent right of
 monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems on this
 occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of
 the clergy. A.D. 813.  The royal youth was commanded to take the crown
 from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his
 head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the
 nation. (116) The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the subsequent associations of Lothaire and
 Lewis the Second: the Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted
 from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations;
 and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour
 of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes, who were
 already invested with their power and dominions. Lewis the Pious, A.D. 814-840 .The pious Lewis survived his brothers, and embraced the whole empire
 of Charlemagne; but the nations and the nobles, his bishops
 and his children, quickly discerned that this mighty mass
 was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the foundations
 were undermined to the centre, while the external surface
 was yet fair and entire. After a war, or battle, which
 consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was divided
 by treaty between his three sons, who had violated every
 filial and fraternal duty. Lothaire I A.D. 840-856 . The kingdoms of Germany and
 France were forever separated; the provinces of Gaul,
 between the Rhone and the Alps, the Meuse and the Rhine,
 were assigned, with Italy, to the Imperial dignity of
 Lothaire. In the partition of his share, Lorraine and Arles,
 two recent and transitory kingdoms, were bestowed on the
 younger children; Lewis II. A.D. 856-875 and Lewis the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his death without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and
 cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of advocate of the Roman church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited any symptoms of
 virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the bald,
 the stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion. Division of the empire, A.D. 888 . By the failure of the collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to Charles the Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorized the
 desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet, and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty had been spared. According to the measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate
 blood of Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title and
 possession were alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate
 to the contracted scale of their dominions. Those who could
 appear with an army at the gates of Rome were crowned
 emperors in the Vatican; but their modesty was more
 frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy:
 and the whole term of seventy-four years may be deemed a
 vacancy, from the abdication of Charles the Fat to the
 establishment of Otho the First.

Otho king of Germany restores and appropriates the Western empire, A.D. 962 . 
 Otho (117) was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and
 if he truly descended from Witikind, the adversary and
 proselyte of Charlemagne, the posterity of a vanquished
 people was exalted to reign over their conquerors. His
 father, Henry the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage of
 the nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany.
 Its limits (118) were enlarged on every side by his son, the
 first and greatest of the Othos. A portion of Gaul, to the
 west of the Rhine, along the banks of the Meuse and the
 Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and
 language it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and
 Tacitus. Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the
 successors of Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken
 kingdoms of Burgundy and Arles. In the North, Christianity
 was propagated by the sword of Otho, the conqueror and
 apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and Oder: the
 marches of Brandenburgh and Sleswick were fortified with
 German colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of
 Poland and Bohemia, confessed themselves his tributary
 vassals. At the head of a victorious army, he passed the
 Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the pope, and
 forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation of
 Germany. From that memorable aera, two maxims of public
 jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time.
 I. That the prince, who was elected in the German diet,
 acquired, from that instant, the subject kingdoms of Italy
 and Rome. II. But that he might not legally assume the
 titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the
 crown from the hands of the Roman pontiff. (119)
Transactions of the Western and Eastern empires . 
 The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the
 East by the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting
 his fathers, the Greek emperors, he presumed to adopt the
 more equal and familiar appellation of brother. (120) Perhaps
 in his connection with Irene he aspired to the name of
 husband: his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language of
 peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage
 with that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most
 sacred duties of a mother. The nature, the duration, the
 probable consequences of such a union between two distant
 and dissonant empires, it is impossible to conjecture; but
 the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to suspect,
 that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to
 charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state
 to the strangers of the West. (121) The French ambassadors
 were the spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the
 conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the national hatred.
 Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege
 of ancient Rome: a proverb, "That the Franks were good
 friends and bad neighbours,"  was in every one's mouth; but it
 was dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to
 reiterate, in the church of St. Sophia, the ceremony of his
 Imperial coronation. After a tedious journey of circuit and
 delay, the ambassadors of Nicephorus found him in his camp,
 on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne affected to
 confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian
 village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine
 palace. (122) The Greeks were successively led through four
 halls of audience: in the first they were ready to fall
 prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state,
 till he informed them that he was only a servant, the
 constable, or master of the horse, of the emperor. The same
 mistake, and the same answer, were repeated in the
 apartments of the count palatine, the steward, and the
 chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually heightened,
 till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown open, and
 they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne, enriched
 with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled
 with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A
 treaty of peace and alliance was concluded between the two
 empires, and the limits of the East and West were defined by
 the right of present possession. But the Greeks (123) soon
 forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it only to
 hate the Barbarians by whom it was extorted. During the
 short union of virtue and power, they respectfully saluted
 the august Charlemagne, with the acclamations of basileus,
 and emperor of the Romans. As soon as these qualities were
 separated in the person of his pious son, the Byzantine
 letters were inscribed, 
 "To the king, or, as he styles himself, the emperor of the Franks and Lombards." 
  When both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the
 Second of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous
 appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of
 Latin princes. His reply (124) is expressive of his weakness: he proves, with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the name of king is synonymous with the
 Greek word basileus: if, at Constantinople, it were assumed
 in a more exclusive and imperial sense, he claims from his
 ancestors, and from the popes, a just participation of the
 honours of the Roman purple. The same controversy was revived
 in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador describes,
 in lively colours, the insolence of the Byzantine court. (125) The Greeks affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons; and in their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman emperors.

Authority of the emperors in the elections of the popes, A.D. 800-1060 . 
 These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to
 exercise the powers which had been assumed by the Gothic and
 Grecian princes; and the importance of this prerogative
 increased with the temporal estate and spiritual
 jurisdiction of the Roman church. In the Christian
 aristocracy, the principal members of the clergy still
 formed a senate to assist the administration, and to supply
 the vacancy, of the bishop. Rome was divided into
 twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was governed by a
 cardinal priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common
 or modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple
 of kings. Their number was enlarged by the association of
 the seven deacons of the most considerable hospitals, the
 seven palatine judges of the Lateran, and some dignitaries
 of the church. This ecclesiastical senate was directed by
 the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman province, who were
 less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto,
 Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than
 by their weekly service in the Lateran, and their superior
 share in the honours and authority of the apostolic see. On
 the death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor
 to the suffrage of the college of cardinals, (126) and their
 choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of
 the Roman people. But the election was imperfect; nor could
 the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the
 advocate of the church, had graciously signified his
 approbation and consent. The royal commissioner examined,
 on the spot, the form and freedom of the proceedings; nor
 was it till after a previous scrutiny into the
 qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath
 of fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had
 successively enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In the
 frequent schisms, the rival claims were submitted to the
 sentence of the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he
 presumed to judge, to condemn, and to punish, the crimes of
 a guilty pontiff. Otho the First imposed a treaty on the
 senate and people, who engaged to prefer the candidate most
 acceptable to his majesty: (127) his successors anticipated
 or prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman benefice,
 like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their
 chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit
 of a Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the
 interposition of foreign power. These acts of prerogative
 were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular
 election. The competitor who had been excluded by the
 cardinals appealed to the passions or avarice of the
 multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were stained with
 blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises of
 Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see
 in a long and disgraceful servitude. Disorders . The Roman pontiffs, of
 the ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned,
 and murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their
 indigence, after the loss and usurpation of the
 ecclesiastical patrimonies, that they could neither support
 the state of a prince, nor exercise the charity of a priest.
 (128) The influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and
 Theodora, was founded on their wealth and beauty, their
 political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their
 lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and their reign
 (129) may have suggested to the darker ages (130) the fable
 (131) of a female pope. (132) The bastard son, the grandson,
 and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were
 seated in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the age of
 nineteen years that the second of these became the head of
 the Latin church.  His youth and manhood were of a
 suitable complexion; and the nations of pilgrims could bear
 testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a
 Roman synod, and in the presence of Otho the Great. As John
 XII. had renounced the dress and decencies of his
 profession, the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the
 wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt, the flames
 that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming and
 hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of
 distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and
 Venus, if it be true, could not possibly be serious. But we
 read, with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of
 Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome;
 that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for
 prostitution, and that his rapes of virgins and widows had
 deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St.
 Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be violated by
 his successor. (133) The Protestants have dwelt with
 malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to
 a philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less
 dangerous than their virtues. Reformation and claims of the church, A.D. 1073, etc.  After a long series of
 scandal, the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the
 austerity and zeal of Gregory VII. That ambitious monk
 devoted his life to the execution of two projects. I. To
 fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence
 of election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation
 of the emperors and the Roman people. II. To bestow and
 resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice (134) of the
 church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings
 and kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years,
 the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm
 support of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was
 connected with that of their chief. But the second attempt,
 though it was crowned with some partial and apparent
 success, has been vigorously resisted by the secular power,
 and finally extinguished by the improvement of human reason.

Authority of the emperors in Rome . 
 In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the
 bishop nor the people could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho
 the provinces which were lost, as they had been won, by the
 chance of arms. But the Romans were free to choose a master
 for themselves; and the powers which had been delegated to
 the patrician, were irrevocably granted to the French and
 Saxon emperors of the West. The broken records of the times
 (135) preserve some remembrance of their palace, their mint,
 their tribunal, their edicts, and the sword of justice,
 which, as late as the thirteenth century, was derived from
 Caesar to the praefect of the city. (136) Between the arts of
 the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy was
 crushed and annihilated. Content with the titles of emperor
 and Augustus, the successors of Charlemagne neglected to
 assert this local jurisdiction. In the hour of prosperity,
 their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in
 the decay and division of the empire, they were oppressed by
 the defence of their hereditary provinces. Revolt of Alberic, A.D. 932 Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of her third husband; and Hugh, king of Burgundy was introduced by her faction into the mole of Hadrian or Castle of St. Angelo, which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome. Her son by the first marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was
 chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was productive of a revolution. 
"Romans," exclaimed the youth, "once you were the masters of the world, and these Burgundians the most abject of your slaves. They now reign, these voracious and brutal savages, and my injury is the commencement of your servitude." (137)
The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city: the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame; Marozia was imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, Pope John XI., was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions. With the title of prince, Alberic possessed above twenty years the government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of consuls and tribunes. His son and heir Octavian assumed, with the pontificate, the name of John XII.: like
 his predecessor, he was provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded with the Imperial dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans were impatient, the
 festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and Otho commanded his
 sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he should be
 assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar. (138)of pope John XII. A.D. 967.  Before
 he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of
 the people and the ingratitude of John XII. The pope was
 degraded in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass,
 whipped through the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen
 of the most guilty were hanged, others were mutilated or
 banished; and this severe process was justified by the
 ancient laws of Theodosius and Justinian. The voice of fame
 has accused the second Otho of a perfidious and bloody act,
 the massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to his
 table under the fair semblance of hospitality and
 friendship. (139) Of the consul Crescentius. A.D. 998. In the minority of his son Otho the Third,
 Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon yoke, and
 the consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic. From
 the condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to
 the command of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created
 the popes, and formed a conspiracy for restoring the
 authority of the Greek emperors.  In the fortress of St.
 Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege, till the
 unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his
 body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on
 the battlements of the castle. By a reverse of fortune,
 Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged three days,
 without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved
 him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The senator
 Ptolemy was the leader of the people, and the widow of
 Crescentius enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging
 her husband, by a poison which she administered to her
 Imperial lover. It was the design of Otho the Third to
 abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect his
 throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the Roman
 monarchy. But his successors only once in their lives
 appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive their crown
 in the Vatican. (140) Their absence was contemptible, their
 presence odious and formidable. They descended from the
 Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers
 and enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a
 scene of tumult and bloodshed. (141) A faint remembrance of
 their ancestors still tormented the Romans; and they beheld
 with pious indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks,
 Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and
 prerogatives of the Caesars.

The kingdom of Italy, A.D. 774-1250 . 
 There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason
 than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign
 nations, in opposition to their inclination and interest. A
 torrent of Barbarians may pass over the earth, but an
 extensive empire must be supported by a refined system of
 policy and oppression; in the centre, an absolute power,
 prompt in action and rich in resources; a swift and easy
 communication with the extreme parts; fortifications to
 check the first effort of rebellion; a regular
 administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined
 army to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and
 despair. Far different was the situation of the German
 Caesars, who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy.
 Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine, or
 scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was
 alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive
 princes; and their revenue, from minute and vexatious
 prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of
 their household. Their troops were formed by the legal or
 voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the
 Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and
 disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the
 campaign. Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential
 influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the
 bones of their princes and nobles, (142) and the effects of
 their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery
 and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the
 calamities of the Barbarians. This irregular tyranny might
 contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor
 can the people, or the reader, be much interested in the
 event of the quarrel. But in the eleventh and twelfth
 centuries, the Lombards rekindled the flame of industry and
 freedom; and the generous example was at length imitated by
 the republics of Tuscany. In the Italian cities a
 municipal government had never been totally abolished; and
 their first privileges were granted by the favour and policy
 of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian
 barrier against the independence of the nobles. But their
 rapid progress, the daily extension of their power and
 pretensions, were founded on the numbers and spirit of these
 rising communities. (143) Each city filled the measure of her
 diocese or district: the jurisdiction of the counts and
 bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from the
 land; and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to
 desert their solitary castles, and to embrace the more
 honourable character of freemen and magistrates. The
 legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly;
 but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls,
 annually chosen from the three orders of captains,
 valvassors, (144) and commons, into which the republic was divided. Under the protection of equal law, the labours of
 agriculture and commerce were gradually revived; but the
 martial spirit of the Lombards was nourished by the presence
 of danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the
 standard (145) erected, the gates of the city poured forth a
 numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause
 was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. At the
 foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the Caesars was
 overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed
 over the two Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle
 age; the first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the
 second, who undoubtedly excelled in the softer
 accomplishments of peace and learning.

Frederic the first, A.D. 1152-1190. 
 Ambitious of restoring the splendour of the purple, Frederic
 the First invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts
 of a statesman, the valour of a soldier, and the cruelty of a
 tyrant. The recent discovery of the Pandects had renewed a
 science most favourable to despotism; and his venal advocates
 proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of the lives and
 properties of his subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a
 less odious sense, were acknowledged in the diet of
 Roncaglia; and the revenue of Italy was fixed at thirty
 thousand pounds of silver, (146) which were multiplied to an
 indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal officers. The
 obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the force of
 his arms: his captives were delivered to the executioner, or
 shot from his military engines; and. after the siege and
 surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately capital
 were razed to the ground, three hundred hostages were sent
 into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in four
 villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror. (147)
 But Milan soon rose from her ashes; and the league of
 Lombardy was cemented by distress: their cause was espoused
 by Venice, Pope Alexander the Third, and the Greek emperor:
 the fabric of oppression was overturned in a day; and in the
 treaty of Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some
 reservations, the freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His
 grandson contended with their vigour and maturity; but
 Frederic II., A.D. 1198-1250. Frederic the Second (148) was endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages. His birth and education recommended
 him to the Italians; and in the implacable discord of the
 two factions, the Ghibelins were attached to the emperor,
 while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the
 church. The court of Rome had slumbered, when his father
 Henry the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the
 kingdoms of Naples and Sicily; and from these hereditary
 realms the son derived an ample and ready supply of troops
 and treasure. Yet Frederic the Second was finally oppressed
 by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican:
 his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the last of his
 family was beheaded at Naples on a public scaffold. During
 sixty years, no emperor appeared in Italy, and the name was
 remembered only by the ignominious sale of the last relics
 of sovereignty.

Independence of the princes of Germany, A.D. 814-1250,etc . 
 The Barbarian conquerors of the West were pleased to
 decorate their chief with the title of emperor; but it was
 not their design to invest him with the despotism of
 Constantine and Justinian. The persons of the Germans were
 free, their conquests were their own, and their national
 character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile
 jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Rome. It would have
 been a vain and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the
 armed freemen, who were impatient of a magistrate; on the
 bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful, who aspired to
 command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was distributed
 among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of
 the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches or
 frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority
 as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the first
 Caesars. The Roman governors, who, for the most part, were
 soldiers of fortune, seduced their mercenary legions,
 assumed the Imperial purple, and either failed or succeeded
 in their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of
 government. If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany,
 were less audacious in their claims, the consequences of
 their success were more lasting and pernicious to the state.
 Instead of aiming at the supreme rank, they silently labored
 to establish and appropriate their provincial independence.
 Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates
 and vassals, their mutual example and support, the common
 interest of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes
 and families, the minorities of Otho the Third and Henry the
 Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain pursuit of
 the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome. All the attributes
 of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually usurped
 by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace and
 war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign
 alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by
 violence, was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as
 the price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service;
 whatever had been granted to one could not, without injury,
 be denied to his successor or equal; and every act of local
 or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the
 constitution of the Germanic kingdom. In every province,
 the visible presence of the duke or count was interposed
 between the throne and the nobles; the subjects of the law
 became the vassals of a private chief; and the standard
 which he received from his sovereign, was often raised
 against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy
 was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of
 the Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who blindly depended
 on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of
 Germany were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in
 wealth and population, to the most ample states of the
 military order. As long as the emperors retained the
 prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic
 and secular benefices, their cause was maintained by the
 gratitude or ambition of their friends and favourites. But in
 the quarrel of the investitures, they were deprived of their
 influence over the episcopal chapters; the freedom of
 election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a
 solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the recommendation,
 once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church. The
 secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of
 a superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their
 peers. In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of
 the son to the duchy or county of his father, was solicited
 as a favour; it was gradually obtained as a custom, and
 extorted as a right: the lineal succession was often
 extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of
 the empire (their popular, and at length their legal,
 appellation) were divided and alienated by testament and
 sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a
 private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor could not
 even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and
 extinction: within the term of a year, he was obliged to
 dispose of the vacant fief; and, in the choice of the
 candidate, it was his duty to consult either the general or
 the provincial diet. 

The Germanic constitution, A.D. 1250. 
After the death of Frederic the Second,
 Germany was left a monster with a hundred heads. A crowd of
 princes and prelates disputed the ruins of the empire: the
 lords of innumerable castles were less prone to obey, than
 to imitate, their superiors; and, according to the measure
 of their strength, their incessant hostilities received the
 names of conquest or robbery. Such anarchy was the
 inevitable consequence of the laws and manners of Europe;
 and the kingdoms of France and Italy were shivered into
 fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But the
 Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and
 destroyed, while the union of the Germans has produced,
 under the name of an empire, a great system of a federative
 republic. In the frequent and at last the perpetual
 institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and
 the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by
 the three branches or colleges of the electors, the princes,
 and the free and Imperial cities of Germany. I. Seven of
 the most powerful feudatories were permitted to assume, with
 a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive privilege of
 choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors were the king
 of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of
 Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the three
 archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The
 college of princes and prelates purged themselves of a
 promiscuous multitude: they reduced to four representative
 votes the long series of independent counts, and excluded
 the nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as
 in the Polish diets, had appeared on horseback in the field
 of election. III. The pride of birth and dominion, of the
 sword and the mitre, wisely adopted the commons as the third
 branch of the legislature, and, in the progress of society,
 they were introduced about the same aera into the national
 assemblies of France England, and Germany. The Hanseatic
 League commanded the trade and navigation of the north: the
 confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and intercourse
 of the inland country; the influence of the cities has been
 adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative
 still invalidates the acts of the two superior colleges of
 electors and princes. (149)
Weakness and poverty of the German emperor Charles IV. A.D. 1347-1378 . 
 It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the
 strongest light the state and contrast of the Roman empire
 of Germany, which no longer held, except on the borders of
 the Rhine and Danube, a single province of Trajan or
 Constantine. Their unworthy successors were the counts of
 Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh:
 the emperor Henry the Seventh procured for his son the crown
 of Bohemia, and his grandson Charles the Fourth was born
 among a people strange and barbarous in the estimation of
 the Germans themselves. (150) After the excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or promise of the
 vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the exile and
 captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the earth.
 The death of his competitors united the electoral college,
 and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and
 future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was
 prostituted to the Caesars of Germany and Greece. The
 German emperor was no more than the elective and impotent
 magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left
 him a village that he might call his own. His best
 prerogative was the right of presiding and proposing in the
 national senate, which was convened at his summons; and his
 native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the adjacent
 city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and the
 richest source of his revenue. A.D. 1355  The army with which he
 passed the Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the
 cathedral of St. Ambrose, Charles was crowned with the iron
 crown, which tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy; but
 he was admitted only with a peaceful train; the gates of the
 city were shut upon him; and the king of Italy was held a
 captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in
 the sovereignty of Milan. In the Vatican he was again
 crowned with the golden crown of the empire; but, in
 obedience to a secret treaty, the Roman emperor immediately
 withdrew, without reposing a single night within the walls
 of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, (151) whose fancy revived
 the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids
 the ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his
 contemporaries could observe, that the sole exercise of his
 authority was in the lucrative sale of privileges and
 titles. The gold of Italy secured the election of his son;
 but such was the shameful poverty of the Roman emperor, that
 his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of
 Worms, and was detained in the public inn, as a pledge or
 hostage for the payment of his expenses.

His ostentation, A.D. 1356 . 
 From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent
 majesty of the same Charles in the diets of the empire. The
 golden bull, which fixes the Germanic constitution, is
 promulgated in the style of a sovereign and legislator. A
 hundred princes bowed before his throne, and exalted their
 own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded to
 their chief or minister. At the royal banquet, the
 hereditary great officers, the seven electors, who in rank
 and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn and
 domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple
 kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz,
 Cologne, and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of
 Germany, Italy, and Arles. The great marshal, on horseback,
 exercised his function with a silver measure of oats, which
 he emptied on the ground, and immediately dismounted to
 regulate the order of the guests The great steward, the
 count palatine of the Rhine, place the dishes on the table.
 The great chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburgh,
 presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and basin, to
 wash. The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was
 represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of Luxemburgh
 and Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great
 huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud
 chorus of horns and hounds. (152) Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to Germany alone: the hereditary
 monarchs of Europe confessed the preeminence of his rank and
 dignity: he was the first of the Christian princes, the
 temporal head of the great republic of the West: (153) to his
 person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he
 disputed with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating
 kings and assembling councils. The oracle of the civil law,
 the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of Charles the Fourth;
 and his school resounded with the doctrine, that the Roman
 emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth, from the
 rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was
 condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the
 gospel had pronounced, 
 "And there went forth a decree from  Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed." (154)
Contrast of the power and modesty of Augustus . 
 If we annihilate the interval of time and space between
 Augustus and Charles, strong and striking will be the
 contrast between the two Caesars; the Bohemian who concealed
 his weakness under the mask of ostentation, and the Roman,
 who disguised his strength under the semblance of modesty.
 At the head of his victorious legions, in his reign over the
 sea and land, from the Nile and Euphrates to the Atlantic
 Ocean, Augustus professed himself the servant of the state
 and the equal of his fellow-citizens. The conqueror of Rome
 and her provinces assumed a popular and legal form of a
 censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will was the law of
 mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the
 voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their
 master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to
 administer the republic. In his dress, his domestics, (155)
 his titles, in all the offices of social life, Augustus
 maintained the character of a private Roman; and his most
 artful flatterers respected the secret of his absolute and
 perpetual monarchy.

 Revolt of Italy, A.D. 728, etc. 
 The first assault of Leo against the images of
 Constantinople had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers
 from Italy and the West, who related with grief and
 indignation the sacrilege of the emperor. But on the
 reception of his proscriptive edict, they trembled for their
 domestic deities: the images of Christ and the Virgin, of
 the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all the
 churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to
 the Roman pontiff, the royal favour as the price of his
 compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his
 disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to
 hesitate; and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed
 the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his
 doctrine or the powers of resistance. Without depending on
 prayers or miracles, he boldly armed against the public
 enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of
 their danger and their duty. (37) At this signal, Ravenna,
 Venice, and the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis,
 adhered to the cause of religion; their military force by
 sea and land consisted, for the most part, of the natives;
 and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into
 the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to live and die
 in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman
 people was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards
 were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy
 war. The most treasonable act, but the most obvious
 revenge, was the destruction of the statues of Leo himself:
 the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion, was
 the withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him of a
 power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a
 new capitation. (38) A form of administration was preserved
 by the election of magistrates and governors; and so high
 was the public indignation, that the Italians were prepared
 to create an orthodox emperor, and to conduct him with a
 fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople. In that
 palace, the Roman bishops, the second and third Gregory,
 were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and every
 attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their
 persons, and to strike at their lives. The city was
 repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards,
 and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they
 landed with foreign troops, they obtained some domestic aid,
 and the superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers
 were attached to the cause of heresy. But these clandestine
 or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance
 of the Romans; the Greeks were overthrown and massacred,
 their leaders suffered an ignominious death, and the popes,
 however inclined to mercy, refused to intercede for these
 guilty victims. At Ravenna, (39) the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud; in
 religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction:
 but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or
 spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent,
 lost his life in a popular sedition. To punish this
 flagitious deed, and restore his dominion in Italy, the
 emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic Gulf. After
 suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay, the
 Greeks made their descent in the neighbourhood of Ravenna:
 they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital, and to
 imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of Justinian the
 Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice
 and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The
 women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in
 prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their
 country; the common danger had united the factions, and the
 event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a
 siege. In a hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately
 yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard,
 and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory. The
 strangers retreated to their ships, but the populous
 sea-coast poured forth a multitude of boats; the waters of
 the Po were so deeply infected with blood, that during six
 years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the
 river; and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated
 the worship of images, and the abhorrence of the Greek
 tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the Roman
 pontiff convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against the
 heresy of the Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was
 tacitly involved, (40) but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet
 suspended over his guilty head. No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a master; and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne, the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine.

 Republic of Rome. 
 The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms
 and arts of Augustus, was rescued, after seven hundred and
 fifty years of servitude, from the persecution of Leo the
 Isaurian. By the Caesars, the triumphs of the consuls had
 been annihilated: in the decline and fall of the empire, the
 god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had insensibly receded
 from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates;
 and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo
 to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth of the Tyber. (42) When the kings were banished, the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and
 virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a well-proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the arts of luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the rights of individuals were
 sacred: one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory. (43) When the sovereignty of the Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious Barbarians. As often as the Franks or
 Lombards expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe, they
 called him a Roman;   By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model of a republican government: they were compelled to
 elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the
 nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not
 be executed without the union and consent of the multitude.
 The style of the Roman senate and people was revived, (45)
 but the spirit was fled; and their new independence was
 disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and
 oppression. The want of laws could only be supplied by the
 influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic
 counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop. His
 alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and
 prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude,
 and oath, accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first
 magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian humility of
 the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord;
 and their face and inscription are still apparent on the
 most ancient coins. (46) Their temporal dominion is now
 confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years; and their
 noblest title is the free choice of a people, whom they had
 redeemed from slavery.

 Rome attacked by the Lombards, A.D. 730-752 . 
 In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of Elis
 enjoyed a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter,
 and in the exercise of the Olympic games. (47) Happy would it
 have been for the Romans, if a similar privilege had guarded
 the patrimony of St. Peter from the calamities of war; if
 the Christians, who visited the holy threshold, would have
 sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his
 successor. But this mystic circle could have been traced
 only by the wand of a legislator and a sage: this pacific
 system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the
 popes the Romans were not addicted, like the inhabitants of
 Elis, to the innocent and placid labours of agriculture; and
 the Barbarians of Italy, though softened by the climate,
 were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of
 public and private life. A memorable example of repentance
 and piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards.
 In arms, at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened
 to the voice of Gregory the Second, (48) withdrew his troops,
 resigned his conquests, respectfully visited the church of
 St. Peter, and after performing his devotions, offered his
 sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his silver cross,
 and his crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle. But this
 religious fervour was the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of
 the moment; the sense of interest is strong and lasting; the
 love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards; and
 both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted by the
 disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the unwarlike
 profession of her new chief. On the first edicts of the
 emperor, they declared themselves the champions of the holy
 images: Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna, which had
 already assumed that distinctive appellation; the Catholics
 of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance to his civil and
 military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the
 first time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna. That
 city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active
 diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians; and those
 faithful subjects obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself,
 in separating the personal guilt of Leo from the general
 cause of the Roman empire. (49) The Greeks were less mindful of the service, than the Lombards of the injury: the two
 nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a
 dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch
 marched to the conquest of Spoleto and Rome: the storm
 evaporated without effect, but the policy of Liutprand
 alarmed Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and
 truce. His successor Astolphus declared himself the equal
 enemy of the emperor and the pope: Ravenna was subdued by
 force or treachery, (50) and this final conquest extinguished
 the series of the exarchs, who had reigned with a
 subordinate power since the time of Justinian and the ruin
 of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was summoned to acknowledge the
 victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign; the annual
 tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each
 citizen, and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to
 exact the penalty of her disobedience. The Romans
 hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the
 threatening Barbarians were checked by arms and
 negotiations, till the popes had engaged the friendship of
 an ally and avenger beyond the Alps. (51)
 Her deliverance by Pepin, A.D. 754 . 
 In his distress, the first  Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the
 French monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and
 who, by his signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his
 country, and perhaps Europe, from the Mahometan yoke. The
 ambassadors of the pope were received by Charles with decent
 reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and the
 shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the
 affairs of Italy, except by a friendly and ineffectual
 mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of his power and
 virtues, assumed the office of champion of the Roman church;
 and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been
 prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger
 was on the banks of the Tyber, the succour on those of the
 Seine, and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant
 misery. Amidst the tears of the city, Stephen the Third
 embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person the
 courts of Lombardy and France, to deprecate the injustice of
 his enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his
 friend. After soothing the public despair by litanies and
 orations, he undertook this laborious journey with the
 ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek emperor.
 The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his threats
 could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of
 the Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed
 in the abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right
 hand of his protector; a hand which was never lifted in
 vain, either in war or friendship. Stephen was entertained
 as the visible successor of the apostle; at the next
 assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were
 exposed to a devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the
 Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror, at the head of
 a French army, which was led by the king in person. The
 Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an ignominious
 peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to respect
 the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was
 Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms,
 than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome
 was again encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive
 of fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his
 complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and
 person of St. Peter himself. (52) The apostle assures his
 adopted sons, the king, the clergy, and the nobles of
 France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in the
 spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the
 founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the Virgin,
 the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of
 heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the
 obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown
 their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be
 the penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his
 temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of the
 perfidious Lombards. The second expedition of Pepin was not
 less rapid and fortunate than the first: St. Peter was
 satisfied, Rome was again saved, and Astolphus was taught
 the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a
 foreign master. After this double chastisement, the
 Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor
 and decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their
 condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of
 the feeble, they peevishly harassed the Romans with a
 repetition of claims, evasions, and inroads, which they
 undertook without reflection, and terminated without glory.
 On either side, their expiring monarchy was pressed by the
 zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the First, the genius, the
 fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the son of Pepin;
 these heroes of the church and state were united in public
 and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the
 prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest
 colours of equity and moderation. (53) The passes of the Alps,
 and the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the
 Lombards; Conquest of Lombardy by Charlemagne, A.D. 774 .the former were surprised, the latter were
 invested, by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of two
 years,  Desiderius, the last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his capital. Under the dominion
 of a foreign king, but in the possession of their national
 laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather than the
 subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and
 manners, and language, from the same Germanic origin. (54)
 Pepin and Charlemagne, Kings of France, A.D. 751. 753. 768. 
 The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesiastical, history. In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the Roman church obtained a favourable
 occasion, a specious title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy. But the most essential gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France, (55) and of patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St. Peter, the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title, was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his valour; his friends were
 multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the saviour of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four generations. The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his
 family. The mayor and the nobles were bound, by an oath of
 fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood of Clovis was pure
 and sacred in their eyes; and their common ambassadors
 addressed the Roman pontiff, to dispel their scruples, or to
 absolve their promise. The interest of Pope Zachary, the
 successor of the two Gregories, prompted him to decide, and
 to decide in their favour: he pronounced that the nation
 might lawfully unite in the same person the title and
 authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a
 victim of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and
 confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days. An
 answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the
 Franks as the opinion of a casuist, the sentence of a judge,
 or the oracle of a prophet: the Merovingian race disappeared
 from the earth; and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the
 suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and
 to march under his standard. His coronation was twice
 performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their most
 faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and
 by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, who, in the
 monastery of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his
 benefactor. The royal unction of the kings of Israel was
 dexterously applied: (56) the successor of St. Peter assumed
 the character of a divine ambassador: a German chieftain was
 transformed into the Lord's anointed; and this Jewish rite
 has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and
 vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were absolved from their
 ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered against them
 and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same
 freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy
 and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes. Without
 apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in
 their present security: the secretary of Charlemagne
 affirms, that the French sceptre was transferred by the
 authority of the popes; (57) and in their boldest
 enterprises, they insist, with confidence, on this signal
 and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.

 Patricians of Rome. 
 II. In the change of manners and language the patricians of
 Rome (58) were far removed from the senate of Romulus, on the palace of Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic,
 or the fictitious parents of the emperor. After the
 recovery of Italy and Africa by the arms of Justinian, the
 importance and danger of those remote provinces required the
 presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently
 styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of
 Ravenna, who fill their place in the chronology of princes,
 extended their jurisdiction over the Roman city. Since the
 revolt of Italy and the loss of the Exarchate, the distress
 of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice of their
 independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the
 right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the
 senate and people successively invested Charles Martel and
 his posterity with the honours of patrician of Rome. The
 leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile
 title and subordinate office; but the reign of the Greek
 emperors was suspended; and, in the vacancy of the empire,
 they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and
 the republic. The Roman ambassadors presented these
 patricians with the keys of the shrine of St. Peter, as a
 pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner which
 it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the
 church and city. (59) In the time of Charles Martel and of
 Pepin, the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the
 freedom, while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the
 patriciate represented only the title, the service, the
 alliance, of these distant protectors. The power and policy
 of Charlemagne annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master.
 In his first visit to the capital, he was received with all
 the honours which had formerly been paid to the exarch, the
 representative of the emperor; and these honours obtained
 some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of Pope
 Adrian the First. (60) No sooner was he informed of the
 sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the
 magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with the banner,
 about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of one
 mile, the Flaminian way was lined with the schools, or
 national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, etc.: the
 Roman youth were under arms; and the children of a more
 tender age, with palms and olive branches in their hands,
 chanted the praises of their great deliverer. At the aspect
 of the holy crosses, and ensigns of the saints, he
 dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his nobles
 to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly
 kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles. In the
 portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his clergy: they
 embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march to the
 altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the
 pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty
 demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years that
 elapsed between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial
 coronation, Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was
 subject, as his own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The
 people swore allegiance to his person and family: in his
 name money was coined, and justice was administered; and the
 election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his
 authority. Except an original and self-inherent claim of
 sovereignty, there was not any prerogative remaining, which
 the title of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome. (61)
 Donations of Pepin and Charlemagne to the popes .  
 The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these
 obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviours
 and benefactors of the Roman church. Her ancient patrimony
 of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the
 temporal dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation
 of the Exarchate was the first-fruits of the conquests of
 Pepin. (62) Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the
 keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered
 to the French ambassador; and, in his master's name, he
 presented them before the tomb of St. Peter. The ample
 measure of the Exarchate (63) might comprise all the
 provinces of Italy which had obeyed the emperor and his
 vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were included
 in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its
 inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched
 along the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced into
 the midland- country as far as the ridges of the Apennine.
 In this transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes
 have been severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a
 Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom,
 which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing
 the virtues of his profession. Perhaps a faithful subject,
 or even a generous enemy, would have been less impatient to
 divide the spoils of the Barbarian; and if the emperor had
 intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the restitution of
 the Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach
 of treachery and falsehood. But in the rigid interpretation
 of the laws, every one may accept, without injury, whatever
 his benefactor can bestow without injustice. The Greek
 emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the
 Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the
 stronger sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the cause
 of the Iconoclast that Pepin has exposed his person and army
 in a double expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and
 might lawfully alienate, his conquests: and to the
 importunities of the Greeks he piously replied that no human
 consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he
 had conferred on the Roman Pontiff for the remission of his
 sins, and the salvation of his soul. The splendid donation
 was granted in supreme and absolute dominion, and the world
 beheld for the first time a Christian bishop invested with
 the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice of
 magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of
 taxes, and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the
 dissolution of the Lombard kingdom, the inhabitants of the
 duchy of Spoleto (64) sought a refuge from the storm, shaved
 their heads after the Roman fashion, declared themselves the
 servants and subjects of St. Peter, and completed, by this
 voluntary surrender, the present circle of the
 ecclesiastical state. That mysterious circle was enlarged
 to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or written donation
 of Charlemagne, (65) who, in the first transports of his
 victory, despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the
 cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the
 Exarchate. But, in the cooler moments of absence and
 reflection, he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the
 recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally. The execution
 of his own and his father's promises was respectfully
 eluded: the king of the Franks and Lombards asserted the
 inalienable rights of the empire; and, in his life and
 death, Ravenna, (66) as well as Rome, was numbered in the
 list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the
 Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes; they found
 in the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic
 rival: (67) the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a
 priest; and in the disorders of the times, they could only
 retain the memory of an ancient claim, which, in a more
 prosperous age, they have revived and realized.

 Forgery of the donation of Constantine . 
 Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the
 strong, though ignorant, Barbarian was often entangled in
 the net of sacerdotal policy. The Vatican and Lateran were
 an arsenal and manufacture, which, according to the
 occasion, have produced or concealed a various collection of
 false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious, acts, as they
 tended to promote the interest of the Roman church. Before
 the end of the eighth century, some apostolic scribe,
 perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the decretals, and
 the donation of Constantine, the two magic pillars of the
 spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes. This
 memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle
 of Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the
 liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine.
 (68) According to the legend, the first of the Christian
 emperors was healed of the leprosy, and purified in the
 waters of baptism, by St. Silvester, the Roman bishop; and
 never was physician more gloriously recompensed. His royal
 proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St. Peter;
 declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the
 East; and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual
 sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the provinces of the West.
 (69) This fiction was productive of the most beneficial
 effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt of
 usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his
 lawful inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt
 of gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians
 were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a
 scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state. The sovereignty
 of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people;
 and the successors of St. Peter and Constantine were
 invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times, that
 the most absurd of fables was received, with equal
 reverence, in Greece and in France, and is still enrolled
 among the decrees of the canon law. (70) The emperors, and
 the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery, that
 subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition
 proceeded from a Sabine monastery, which, in the beginning
 of the twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of
 the donation of Constantine. (71) In the revival of letters
 and liberty, this fictitious deed was transpierced by the
 pen of Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a
 Roman patriot. (72) His contemporaries of the fifteenth
 century were astonished at his sacrilegious boldness; yet
 such is the silent and irresistible progress of reason,
 that, before the end of the next age, the fable was rejected
 by the contempt of historians (73) and poets, (74) and the
 tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the Roman
 church. (75) The popes themselves have indulged a smile at
 the credulity of the vulgar; (76) but a false and obsolete
 title still sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune
 which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles,
 the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been
 undermined.

 Restoration of images in the East by the empress Irene, A.D. 780, etc . 
 While the popes established in Italy their freedom and
 dominion, the images, the first cause of their revolt, were
 restored in the Eastern empire. (77) Under the reign of
 Constantine the Fifth, the union of civil and ecclesiastical
 power had overthrown the tree, without extirpating the root,
 of superstition. The idols (for such they were now held)
 were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone
 to devotion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females
 obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of
 man. Leo the Fourth maintained with less rigour the religion
 of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair and
 ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the
 heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their
 ancestors. During the life of her husband, these sentiments
 were inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could
 only labor to protect and promote some favourite monks whom
 she drew from their caverns, and seated on the metropolitan
 thrones of the East. But as soon as she reigned in her own
 name and that of her son, Irene more seriously undertook the
 ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the first step of her future
 persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience.
 In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were
 exposed to the public veneration; a thousand legends were
 inverted of their sufferings and miracles. By the
 opportunities of death or removal, the episcopal seats were
 judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or
 celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of
 their sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius
 gave Irene the patriarch of Constantinople, and the command
 of the Oriental church. But the decrees of a general
 council could only be repealed by a similar assembly: (78)
 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in possession,
 and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops
 was reechoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers
 and people of Constantinople. VIIth general council, IInd of Nice, A.D. 787, Sept. 24-Oct. 23 .The delay and intrigues of a
 year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the
 choice of Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these
 obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again, after the
 Greek fashion, in the hands of the prince. No more than
 eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this
 important work: the Iconoclasts appeared, not as judges, but
 as criminals or penitents: the scene was decorated by the
 legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern patriarchs, (79) the
 decrees were framed by the president Taracius, and ratified
 by the acclamations and subscriptions of three hundred and
 fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the
 worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to
 the fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate
 whether that worship be relative or direct; whether the
 Godhead, and the figure of Christ, be entitled to the same
 mode of adoration. Of this second Nicene council the acts
 are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and
 ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I shall only notice the
 judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of
 image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a truce
 with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting
 his daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His
 scruples prompted him to consult the abbot.  Final establishment of images by the empress Theodora, A.D. 842
 For the honour of orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who convened the two councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons. The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her friends. During the five succeeding reigns, a period of thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated rage and various success, between the worshippers and the breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events. Nicephorus
 allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed the character of Michael the First, but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. In the purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were condemned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor, the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties; and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly
 against them; and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were
 exasperated and punished by the public hatred. After the
 death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was
 achieved by a second female, his widow Theodora, whom he
 left the guardian of the empire. Her measures were bold and
 decisive. The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the
 fame and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of
 the Iconoclast patriarch was commuted from the loss of his
 eyes to a whipping of two hundred lashes: the bishops
 trembled, the monks shouted, and the festival of orthodoxy
 preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images. A
 single question yet remained, whether they are endowed with
 any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the
 Greeks of the eleventh century; (81) and as this opinion has
 the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised
 that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative.
 In the West, Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced
 the decrees of the Nicene assembly, which is now revered by
 the Catholics as the seventh in rank of the general
 councils. Rome and Italy were docile to the voice of their
 father; but the greatest part of the Latin Christians were
 far behind in the race of superstition. Reluctance of the Franks and Charlemagne, A.D. 794, etc . The churches of
 France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle course
 between the adoration and the destruction of images, which
 they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship,
 but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history. An
 angry book of controversy was composed and published in the
 name of Charlemagne: (82) under his authority a synod of
 three hundred bishops was assembled at Frankfort: (83) they
 blamed the fury of the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a
 more severe censure against the superstition of the Greeks,
 and the decrees of their pretended council, which was long
 despised by the Barbarians of the West. (84) Among them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible
 progress; but a large atonement is made for their hesitation
 and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede
 the reformation, and of the countries, both in Europe and
 America, which are still immersed in the gloom of
 superstition.

 Final separation of the popes from the Eastern empire, A.D. 774-800. 
 It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the
 pious Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of
 Rome and Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less
 orthodox Charlemagne. They were compelled to choose between
 the rival nations: religion was not the sole motive of their
 choice; and while they dissembled the failings of their
 friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the
 Catholic virtues of their foes. The difference of language
 and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals;
 and they were alienated from each other by the hostile
 opposition of seventy years. In that schism the Romans had
 tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their
 submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a
 jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the
 impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court.
 The Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not
 restored the Calabrian estates (85) and the Illyrian diocese,
 (86) which the Iconociasts had torn away from the successors
 of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence
 of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this
 practical heresy. (87) The Greeks were now orthodox; but
 their religion might be tainted by the breath of the
 reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious; but a
 discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion,
 from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of
 Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his
 scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the
 temper of a statesman, to the various practice of France and
 Italy. In his four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he
 embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety;
 knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of
 the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers
 and processions of the Roman liturgy. Would prudence or
 gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?
 Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had
 they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of
 patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne;
 and it was only by reviving the Western empire that they
 could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.
 By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the
 claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial
 town, the majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin
 Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their
 ancient metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would
 receive their crown from the successors of St. Peter. The
 Roman church would acquire a zealous and respectable
 advocate; and, under the shadow of the Carlovingian power,
 the bishop might exercise, with honour and safety, the
 government of the city. (88)
 Coronation of Charlemagne as emperor of Rome and of the West, A.D. 800, Dec. 25 . 
 Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome, the competition for a
 wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and
 bloodshed. The people was less numerous, but the times were
 more savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St.
 Peter was fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who
 aspired to the rank of sovereign. The reign of Adrian the
 First (89) surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages;
 (90) the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the
 Lombards, and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the
 trophies of his fame: he secretly edified the throne of his
 successors, and displayed in a narrow space the virtues of a
 great prince. His memory was revered; but in the next
 election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was
 preferred to the nephew and the favourite of Adrian, whom he
 had promoted to the first dignities of the church. Their
 acquiescence or repentance disguised, above four years, the
 blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a procession,
 when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed
 multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred
 person of the pope. But their enterprise on his life or
 liberty was disappointed, perhaps by their own confusion and
 remorse. Leo was left for dead on the ground: on his revival
 from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood, he
 recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was
 improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and
 tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by
 the knife of the assassins. (91) From his prison he escaped
 to the Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue,
 Charlemagne sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of
 Paderborn in Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from
 the Roman pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission
 of counts and bishops, the guards of his safety and the
 judges of his innocence; and it was not without reluctance,
 that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing
 year the personal discharge of this pious office. In his
 fourth and last pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the
 due honours of king and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge
 himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge: his
 enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious attempt against
 his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty
 of exile. On the festival of Christmas, the last year of
 the eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the church of
 St. Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had
 exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a
 patrician. (92) After the celebration of the holy mysteries,
 Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, (93) and
 the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people,    The head and body of Charlemagne were consecrated by the
 royal unction: after the example of the Caesars, he was
 saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation oath
 represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of
 the church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich
 offerings to the shrine of his apostle. In his familiar
 conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the
 intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his
 absence on that memorable day. But the preparations of the
 ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of
 Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had
 acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his
 ambition, and a Roman synod had pronounced, that it was the
 only adequate reward of his merit and services. (94)
 Reign and character of Charlemagne, A.D. 768-814 . 
 The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and
 sometimes deserved; but CHARLEMAGNE is the only prince in
 whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended with the
 name. That name, with the addition of saint, is inserted in
 the Roman calendar; and the saint, by a rare felicity, is
 crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers
 of an enlightened age. (95) His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from
 which he emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is
 likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison; and the ruins of
 Palmyra derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the
 surrounding desert. Without injustice to his fame, I may
 discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the
 restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues,
 chastity is not the most conspicuous: (96) but the public
 happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives
 or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or more
 transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he
 bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and licentious
 manners of his daughters, (97) whom the father was suspected
 of loving with too fond a passion.  I shall be scarcely
 permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a
 day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman,
 the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the four thousand
 five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot,
 would have something to allege against the justice and
 humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished
 Saxons (98) was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws
 were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the
 discussion of his motives, whatever is subtracted from
 bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary reader is
 amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his
 subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden
 presence, at the moment when they believed him at the most
 distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor
 summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy
 cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the
 geography of his expeditions.  But this activity was a
 national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life
 of a Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in
 military adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were
 distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more
 important purpose. His military renown must be tried by the
 scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions.
 Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two
 heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name,
 their examples, and the companions of their victories. At
 the head of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed
 the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of
 confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever
 encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or
 in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with
 the arts of peace; but his campaigns are not illustrated by
 any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success; and
 he might behold, with envy, the Saracen trophies of his
 grandfather. After the Spanish expedition, his rear-guard
 was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and the soldiers,
 whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was
 useless, might accuse, with their last breath, the want of
 skill or caution of their general. (99) I touch with
 reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a
 respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series,
 of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of
 abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his
 farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his
 eggs. He wished to improve the laws and the character of
 the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and imperfect,
 are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the times
 were suspended or mollified by his government; (100) but in
 his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and
 the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives himself
 for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of
 his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated
 the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his
 sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole constitution
 was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and
 despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the
 clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with
 temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction; and his son Lewis,
 when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops, might
 accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his father. His
 laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons
 had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had
 been the cause of the last scarcity. (101) The literary
 merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of
 schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were
 published in his name, and his familiar connection with the
 subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to
 educate both the prince and people. His own studies were
 tardy, laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and
 understood Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from
 conversation, rather than from books; and, in his mature
 age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing,
 which every peasant now learns in his infancy. (102) The
 grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times,
 were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but
 the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its
 improvement, and the encouragement of learning reflects the
 purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of
 Charlemagne. (103) The dignity of his person, (104) the length
 of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his
 government, and the reverence of distant nations,
 distinguish him from the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new
 aera from his restoration of the Western empire.

 Extent of his empire. 
 That empire was not unworthy of its title; (105) and some of
 the fairest kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or
 conquest of a prince, who reigned at the same time in
 France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary. (106)
France. I. The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into the name
 and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the Merovingian
 line, its limits were contracted by the independence of the
 Britons and the revolt of Aquitain. Charlemagne pursued, and
 confined, the Britons on the shores of the ocean; and that
 ferocious tribe, whose origin and language are so different
 from the French, was chastised by the imposition of tribute,
 hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive contest, the
 rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the
 forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their
 lives. Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of
 ambitious governors, who had too faithfully copied the
 mayors of the palace. But a recent discovery (107) has
 proved that these unhappy princes were the last and lawful
 heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger
 branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the Merovingian
 house. Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of
 Gascogne, to the counties of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at the
 foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the
 beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving
 their Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the
 injustice, or the favours, of a third dynasty. By the
 reunion of Aquitain, France was enlarged to its present
 boundaries, with the additions of the Netherlands and Spain,
 as far as the Rhine. Spain . II. The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father of Charlemagne;
 but they still possessed the greatest part of SPAIN, from
 the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst their civil
 divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his
 protection in the diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook
 the expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction
 of faith, impartially crushed the resistance of the
 Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services of the
 Mahometans. In his absence he instituted the Spanish march,
 (108) which extended from the Pyrenees to the River Ebro:
 Barcelona was the residence of the French governor: he
 possessed the counties of Rousillon and Catalonia; and the
 infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were subject to his
 jurisdiction. III. Italy .As king of the Lombards, and patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of ITALY, (109) a
 tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of
 Calabria. The duchy of Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had
 spread, at the expense of the Greeks, over the modern
 kingdom of Naples. But Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused
 to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the
 independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the
 Carlovingian monarchy. His defence was firm, his submission
 was not inglorious, and the emperor was content with an easy
 tribute, the demolition of his fortresses, and the
 acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord. The artful
 flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of
 father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and
 Benventum insensibly escaped from the French yoke. (110) IV. Germany .Charlemagne was the first who united GERMANY under the same
 sceptre. The name of  Oriental France is preserved in the
 circle of Franconia; and the people of Hesse and Thuringia
 were recently incorporated with the victors, by the
 conformity of religion and government. The Alemanni, so
 formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals and
 confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed
 within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland.
 The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and
 manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated
 treasons of Tasillo justified the abolition of their
 hereditary dukes; and their power was shared among the
 counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier. But
 the north of Germany, from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe,
 was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of
 thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the yoke of
 Christ and of Charlemagne. The idols and their votaries
 were extirpated: the foundation of eight bishoprics, of
 Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen,
 Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side
 of the Weser, the bounds of ancient Saxony these episcopal
 seats were the first schools and cities of that savage land;
 and the religion and humanity of the children atoned, in
 some degree, for the massacre of the parents. Beyond the
 Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and
 various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of
 Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of
 obedience have tempted the French historian to extend the
 empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or
 conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but
 the first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be
 justly ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. Hungary . He
 retaliated on the Avars, or Huns of Pannonia, the same
 calamities which they had inflicted on the nations. Their
 rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their
 districts and villages, were broken down by the triple
 effort of a French army, that was poured into their country
 by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and
 along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of
 eight years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by
 the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the
 nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left
 desolate and unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two
 hundred and fifty years, enriched the victorious troops, or
 decorated the churches of Italy and Gaul. (111) After the
 reduction of Pannonia, the empire of Charlemagne was bounded
 only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the
 Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were
 an easy, though unprofitable, accession; and it was an
 effect of his moderation, that he left the maritime cities
 under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks. But
 these distant possessions added more to the reputation than
 to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he risk any
 ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians from
 their vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of
 communication between the rivers, the Saone and the Meuse,
 the Rhine and the Danube, were faintly attempted. (112) Their
 execution would have vivified the empire; and more cost and
 labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral. 
 His neighbours and enemies . 
 If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it
 will be seen that the empire of the Franks extended, between
 east and west, from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula; between
 the north and south, from the duchy of Beneventum to the
 River Eyder, the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark.
 The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was
 magnified by the distress and division of the rest of
 Europe. The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were
 disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin:
 and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian and Gothic
 kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow
 range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns
 revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch,
 implored the honour and support of his alliance, and styled
 him their common parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the
 West. (113) He maintained a more equal intercourse with the
 caliph Harun al Rashid, (114) whose dominion stretched from
 Africa to India, and accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a
 water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy
 Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive the private
 friendship of a Frank and an Arab, who were strangers to
 each other's person, and language, and religion: but their
 public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their
 remote situation left no room for a competition of interest.
 Two thirds of the Western empire of Rome were subject to
 Charlemagne, and the deficiency was amply supplied by his
 command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of
 Germany. But in the choice of his enemies,  we may be
 reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty
 of the north to the riches of the south. The
 three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods
 and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the
 amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from
 Italy and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the
 Greeks would have insured an easy victory; and the holy
 crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by
 glory and revenge, and loudly justified by religion and
 policy. Perhaps, in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and the
 Elbe, he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the
 Roman empire, to disarm the enemies of civilized society,
 and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations. But it has
 been wisely observed, that, in a light of precaution, all
 conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be universal,
 since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger
 sphere of hostility. (115) The subjugation of Germany
 withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent
 or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and
 awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The
 fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian
 tyrant to their brethren of the North; the Ocean and
 Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets; and
 Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of
 the Normans, who, in less than seventy years, precipitated
 the fall of his race and monarchy.

 His successors. A.D. 814-887 in Italy; 911 in Germany; 987 in France . 
 Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive
 constitution, the titles of emperor and Augustus were
 conferred on Charlemagne for the term of his life; and his
 successors, on each vacancy, must have ascended the throne
 by a formal or tacit election. But the association of his
 son Lewis the Pious asserts the independent right of
 monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems on this
 occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of
 the clergy. A.D. 813.  The royal youth was commanded to take the crown
 from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his
 head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the
 nation. (116) The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the subsequent associations of Lothaire and
 Lewis the Second: the Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted
 from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations;
 and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour
 of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes, who were
 already invested with their power and dominions. Lewis the Pious, A.D. 814-840 .The pious Lewis survived his brothers, and embraced the whole empire
 of Charlemagne; but the nations and the nobles, his bishops
 and his children, quickly discerned that this mighty mass
 was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the foundations
 were undermined to the centre, while the external surface
 was yet fair and entire. After a war, or battle, which
 consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was divided
 by treaty between his three sons, who had violated every
 filial and fraternal duty. Lothaire I A.D. 840-856 . The kingdoms of Germany and
 France were forever separated; the provinces of Gaul,
 between the Rhone and the Alps, the Meuse and the Rhine,
 were assigned, with Italy, to the Imperial dignity of
 Lothaire. In the partition of his share, Lorraine and Arles,
 two recent and transitory kingdoms, were bestowed on the
 younger children; Lewis II. A.D. 856-875 and Lewis the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his death without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and
 cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of advocate of the Roman church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited any symptoms of
 virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the bald,
 the stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion. Division of the empire, A.D. 888 . By the failure of the collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to Charles the Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorized the
 desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet, and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty had been spared. According to the measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate
 blood of Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title and
 possession were alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate
 to the contracted scale of their dominions. Those who could
 appear with an army at the gates of Rome were crowned
 emperors in the Vatican; but their modesty was more
 frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy:
 and the whole term of seventy-four years may be deemed a
 vacancy, from the abdication of Charles the Fat to the
 establishment of Otho the First.

 Otho king of Germany restores and appropriates the Western empire, A.D. 962 . 
 Otho (117) was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and
 if he truly descended from Witikind, the adversary and
 proselyte of Charlemagne, the posterity of a vanquished
 people was exalted to reign over their conquerors. His
 father, Henry the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage of
 the nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany.
 Its limits (118) were enlarged on every side by his son, the
 first and greatest of the Othos. A portion of Gaul, to the
 west of the Rhine, along the banks of the Meuse and the
 Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and
 language it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and
 Tacitus. Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the
 successors of Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken
 kingdoms of Burgundy and Arles. In the North, Christianity
 was propagated by the sword of Otho, the conqueror and
 apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and Oder: the
 marches of Brandenburgh and Sleswick were fortified with
 German colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of
 Poland and Bohemia, confessed themselves his tributary
 vassals. At the head of a victorious army, he passed the
 Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the pope, and
 forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation of
 Germany. From that memorable aera, two maxims of public
 jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time.
 I. That the prince, who was elected in the German diet,
 acquired, from that instant, the subject kingdoms of Italy
 and Rome. II. But that he might not legally assume the
 titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the
 crown from the hands of the Roman pontiff. (119)
 Transactions of the Western and Eastern empires . 
 The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the
 East by the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting
 his fathers, the Greek emperors, he presumed to adopt the
 more equal and familiar appellation of brother. (120) Perhaps
 in his connection with Irene he aspired to the name of
 husband: his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language of
 peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage
 with that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most
 sacred duties of a mother. The nature, the duration, the
 probable consequences of such a union between two distant
 and dissonant empires, it is impossible to conjecture; but
 the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to suspect,
 that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to
 charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state
 to the strangers of the West. (121) The French ambassadors
 were the spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the
 conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the national hatred.
 Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege
 of ancient Rome: a proverb, "That the Franks were good
 friends and bad neighbours,"  was in every one's mouth; but it
 was dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to
 reiterate, in the church of St. Sophia, the ceremony of his
 Imperial coronation. After a tedious journey of circuit and
 delay, the ambassadors of Nicephorus found him in his camp,
 on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne affected to
 confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian
 village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine
 palace. (122) The Greeks were successively led through four
 halls of audience: in the first they were ready to fall
 prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state,
 till he informed them that he was only a servant, the
 constable, or master of the horse, of the emperor. The same
 mistake, and the same answer, were repeated in the
 apartments of the count palatine, the steward, and the
 chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually heightened,
 till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown open, and
 they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne, enriched
 with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled
 with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A
 treaty of peace and alliance was concluded between the two
 empires, and the limits of the East and West were defined by
 the right of present possession. But the Greeks (123) soon
 forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it only to
 hate the Barbarians by whom it was extorted. During the
 short union of virtue and power, they respectfully saluted
 the august Charlemagne, with the acclamations of basileus,
 and emperor of the Romans. As soon as these qualities were
 separated in the person of his pious son, the Byzantine
 letters were inscribed,    When both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the
 Second of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous
 appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of
 Latin princes. His reply (124) is expressive of his weakness: he proves, with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the name of king is synonymous with the
 Greek word basileus: if, at Constantinople, it were assumed
 in a more exclusive and imperial sense, he claims from his
 ancestors, and from the popes, a just participation of the
 honours of the Roman purple. The same controversy was revived
 in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador describes,
 in lively colours, the insolence of the Byzantine court. (125) The Greeks affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons; and in their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman emperors.

 Authority of the emperors in the elections of the popes, A.D. 800-1060 . 
 These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to
 exercise the powers which had been assumed by the Gothic and
 Grecian princes; and the importance of this prerogative
 increased with the temporal estate and spiritual
 jurisdiction of the Roman church. In the Christian
 aristocracy, the principal members of the clergy still
 formed a senate to assist the administration, and to supply
 the vacancy, of the bishop. Rome was divided into
 twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was governed by a
 cardinal priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common
 or modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple
 of kings. Their number was enlarged by the association of
 the seven deacons of the most considerable hospitals, the
 seven palatine judges of the Lateran, and some dignitaries
 of the church. This ecclesiastical senate was directed by
 the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman province, who were
 less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto,
 Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than
 by their weekly service in the Lateran, and their superior
 share in the honours and authority of the apostolic see. On
 the death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor
 to the suffrage of the college of cardinals, (126) and their
 choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of
 the Roman people. But the election was imperfect; nor could
 the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the
 advocate of the church, had graciously signified his
 approbation and consent. The royal commissioner examined,
 on the spot, the form and freedom of the proceedings; nor
 was it till after a previous scrutiny into the
 qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath
 of fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had
 successively enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In the
 frequent schisms, the rival claims were submitted to the
 sentence of the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he
 presumed to judge, to condemn, and to punish, the crimes of
 a guilty pontiff. Otho the First imposed a treaty on the
 senate and people, who engaged to prefer the candidate most
 acceptable to his majesty: (127) his successors anticipated
 or prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman benefice,
 like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their
 chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit
 of a Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the
 interposition of foreign power. These acts of prerogative
 were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular
 election. The competitor who had been excluded by the
 cardinals appealed to the passions or avarice of the
 multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were stained with
 blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises of
 Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see
 in a long and disgraceful servitude. Disorders . The Roman pontiffs, of
 the ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned,
 and murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their
 indigence, after the loss and usurpation of the
 ecclesiastical patrimonies, that they could neither support
 the state of a prince, nor exercise the charity of a priest.
 (128) The influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and
 Theodora, was founded on their wealth and beauty, their
 political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their
 lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and their reign
 (129) may have suggested to the darker ages (130) the fable
 (131) of a female pope. (132) The bastard son, the grandson,
 and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were
 seated in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the age of
 nineteen years that the second of these became the head of
 the Latin church.  His youth and manhood were of a
 suitable complexion; and the nations of pilgrims could bear
 testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a
 Roman synod, and in the presence of Otho the Great. As John
 XII. had renounced the dress and decencies of his
 profession, the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the
 wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt, the flames
 that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming and
 hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of
 distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and
 Venus, if it be true, could not possibly be serious. But we
 read, with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of
 Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome;
 that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for
 prostitution, and that his rapes of virgins and widows had
 deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St.
 Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be violated by
 his successor. (133) The Protestants have dwelt with
 malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to
 a philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less
 dangerous than their virtues. Reformation and claims of the church, A.D. 1073, etc.  After a long series of
 scandal, the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the
 austerity and zeal of Gregory VII. That ambitious monk
 devoted his life to the execution of two projects. I. To
 fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence
 of election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation
 of the emperors and the Roman people. II. To bestow and
 resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice (134) of the
 church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings
 and kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years,
 the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm
 support of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was
 connected with that of their chief. But the second attempt,
 though it was crowned with some partial and apparent
 success, has been vigorously resisted by the secular power,
 and finally extinguished by the improvement of human reason.

 Authority of the emperors in Rome . 
 In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the
 bishop nor the people could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho
 the provinces which were lost, as they had been won, by the
 chance of arms. But the Romans were free to choose a master
 for themselves; and the powers which had been delegated to
 the patrician, were irrevocably granted to the French and
 Saxon emperors of the West. The broken records of the times
 (135) preserve some remembrance of their palace, their mint,
 their tribunal, their edicts, and the sword of justice,
 which, as late as the thirteenth century, was derived from
 Caesar to the praefect of the city. (136) Between the arts of
 the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy was
 crushed and annihilated. Content with the titles of emperor
 and Augustus, the successors of Charlemagne neglected to
 assert this local jurisdiction. In the hour of prosperity,
 their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in
 the decay and division of the empire, they were oppressed by
 the defence of their hereditary provinces. Revolt of Alberic, A.D. 932 Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of her third husband; and Hugh, king of Burgundy was introduced by her faction into the mole of Hadrian or Castle of St. Angelo, which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome. Her son by the first marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was
 chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was productive of a revolution.  The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city: the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame; Marozia was imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, Pope John XI., was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions. With the title of prince, Alberic possessed above twenty years the government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of consuls and tribunes. His son and heir Octavian assumed, with the pontificate, the name of John XII.: like
 his predecessor, he was provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded with the Imperial dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans were impatient, the
 festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and Otho commanded his
 sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he should be
 assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar. (138)of pope John XII. A.D. 967.  Before
 he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of
 the people and the ingratitude of John XII. The pope was
 degraded in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass,
 whipped through the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen
 of the most guilty were hanged, others were mutilated or
 banished; and this severe process was justified by the
 ancient laws of Theodosius and Justinian. The voice of fame
 has accused the second Otho of a perfidious and bloody act,
 the massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to his
 table under the fair semblance of hospitality and
 friendship. (139) Of the consul Crescentius. A.D. 998. In the minority of his son Otho the Third,
 Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon yoke, and
 the consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic. From
 the condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to
 the command of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created
 the popes, and formed a conspiracy for restoring the
 authority of the Greek emperors.  In the fortress of St.
 Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege, till the
 unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his
 body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on
 the battlements of the castle. By a reverse of fortune,
 Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged three days,
 without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved
 him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The senator
 Ptolemy was the leader of the people, and the widow of
 Crescentius enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging
 her husband, by a poison which she administered to her
 Imperial lover. It was the design of Otho the Third to
 abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect his
 throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the Roman
 monarchy. But his successors only once in their lives
 appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive their crown
 in the Vatican. (140) Their absence was contemptible, their
 presence odious and formidable. They descended from the
 Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers
 and enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a
 scene of tumult and bloodshed. (141) A faint remembrance of
 their ancestors still tormented the Romans; and they beheld
 with pious indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks,
 Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and
 prerogatives of the Caesars.

 The kingdom of Italy, A.D. 774-1250 . 
 There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason
 than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign
 nations, in opposition to their inclination and interest. A
 torrent of Barbarians may pass over the earth, but an
 extensive empire must be supported by a refined system of
 policy and oppression; in the centre, an absolute power,
 prompt in action and rich in resources; a swift and easy
 communication with the extreme parts; fortifications to
 check the first effort of rebellion; a regular
 administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined
 army to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and
 despair. Far different was the situation of the German
 Caesars, who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy.
 Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine, or
 scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was
 alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive
 princes; and their revenue, from minute and vexatious
 prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of
 their household. Their troops were formed by the legal or
 voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the
 Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and
 disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the
 campaign. Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential
 influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the
 bones of their princes and nobles, (142) and the effects of
 their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery
 and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the
 calamities of the Barbarians. This irregular tyranny might
 contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor
 can the people, or the reader, be much interested in the
 event of the quarrel. But in the eleventh and twelfth
 centuries, the Lombards rekindled the flame of industry and
 freedom; and the generous example was at length imitated by
 the republics of Tuscany. In the Italian cities a
 municipal government had never been totally abolished; and
 their first privileges were granted by the favour and policy
 of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian
 barrier against the independence of the nobles. But their
 rapid progress, the daily extension of their power and
 pretensions, were founded on the numbers and spirit of these
 rising communities. (143) Each city filled the measure of her
 diocese or district: the jurisdiction of the counts and
 bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from the
 land; and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to
 desert their solitary castles, and to embrace the more
 honourable character of freemen and magistrates. The
 legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly;
 but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls,
 annually chosen from the three orders of captains,
 valvassors, (144) and commons, into which the republic was divided. Under the protection of equal law, the labours of
 agriculture and commerce were gradually revived; but the
 martial spirit of the Lombards was nourished by the presence
 of danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the
 standard (145) erected, the gates of the city poured forth a
 numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause
 was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. At the
 foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the Caesars was
 overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed
 over the two Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle
 age; the first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the
 second, who undoubtedly excelled in the softer
 accomplishments of peace and learning.

 Frederic the first, A.D. 1152-1190. 
 Ambitious of restoring the splendour of the purple, Frederic
 the First invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts
 of a statesman, the valour of a soldier, and the cruelty of a
 tyrant. The recent discovery of the Pandects had renewed a
 science most favourable to despotism; and his venal advocates
 proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of the lives and
 properties of his subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a
 less odious sense, were acknowledged in the diet of
 Roncaglia; and the revenue of Italy was fixed at thirty
 thousand pounds of silver, (146) which were multiplied to an
 indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal officers. The
 obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the force of
 his arms: his captives were delivered to the executioner, or
 shot from his military engines; and. after the siege and
 surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately capital
 were razed to the ground, three hundred hostages were sent
 into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in four
 villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror. (147)
 But Milan soon rose from her ashes; and the league of
 Lombardy was cemented by distress: their cause was espoused
 by Venice, Pope Alexander the Third, and the Greek emperor:
 the fabric of oppression was overturned in a day; and in the
 treaty of Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some
 reservations, the freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His
 grandson contended with their vigour and maturity; but
 Frederic II., A.D. 1198-1250. Frederic the Second (148) was endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages. His birth and education recommended
 him to the Italians; and in the implacable discord of the
 two factions, the Ghibelins were attached to the emperor,
 while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the
 church. The court of Rome had slumbered, when his father
 Henry the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the
 kingdoms of Naples and Sicily; and from these hereditary
 realms the son derived an ample and ready supply of troops
 and treasure. Yet Frederic the Second was finally oppressed
 by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican:
 his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the last of his
 family was beheaded at Naples on a public scaffold. During
 sixty years, no emperor appeared in Italy, and the name was
 remembered only by the ignominious sale of the last relics
 of sovereignty.

 Independence of the princes of Germany, A.D. 814-1250,etc . 
 The Barbarian conquerors of the West were pleased to
 decorate their chief with the title of emperor; but it was
 not their design to invest him with the despotism of
 Constantine and Justinian. The persons of the Germans were
 free, their conquests were their own, and their national
 character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile
 jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Rome. It would have
 been a vain and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the
 armed freemen, who were impatient of a magistrate; on the
 bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful, who aspired to
 command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was distributed
 among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of
 the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches or
 frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority
 as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the first
 Caesars. The Roman governors, who, for the most part, were
 soldiers of fortune, seduced their mercenary legions,
 assumed the Imperial purple, and either failed or succeeded
 in their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of
 government. If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany,
 were less audacious in their claims, the consequences of
 their success were more lasting and pernicious to the state.
 Instead of aiming at the supreme rank, they silently labored
 to establish and appropriate their provincial independence.
 Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates
 and vassals, their mutual example and support, the common
 interest of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes
 and families, the minorities of Otho the Third and Henry the
 Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain pursuit of
 the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome. All the attributes
 of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually usurped
 by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace and
 war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign
 alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by
 violence, was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as
 the price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service;
 whatever had been granted to one could not, without injury,
 be denied to his successor or equal; and every act of local
 or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the
 constitution of the Germanic kingdom. In every province,
 the visible presence of the duke or count was interposed
 between the throne and the nobles; the subjects of the law
 became the vassals of a private chief; and the standard
 which he received from his sovereign, was often raised
 against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy
 was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of
 the Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who blindly depended
 on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of
 Germany were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in
 wealth and population, to the most ample states of the
 military order. As long as the emperors retained the
 prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic
 and secular benefices, their cause was maintained by the
 gratitude or ambition of their friends and favourites. But in
 the quarrel of the investitures, they were deprived of their
 influence over the episcopal chapters; the freedom of
 election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a
 solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the recommendation,
 once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church. The
 secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of
 a superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their
 peers. In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of
 the son to the duchy or county of his father, was solicited
 as a favour; it was gradually obtained as a custom, and
 extorted as a right: the lineal succession was often
 extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of
 the empire (their popular, and at length their legal,
 appellation) were divided and alienated by testament and
 sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a
 private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor could not
 even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and
 extinction: within the term of a year, he was obliged to
 dispose of the vacant fief; and, in the choice of the
 candidate, it was his duty to consult either the general or
 the provincial diet. 

 The Germanic constitution, A.D. 1250. 
After the death of Frederic the Second,
 Germany was left a monster with a hundred heads. A crowd of
 princes and prelates disputed the ruins of the empire: the
 lords of innumerable castles were less prone to obey, than
 to imitate, their superiors; and, according to the measure
 of their strength, their incessant hostilities received the
 names of conquest or robbery. Such anarchy was the
 inevitable consequence of the laws and manners of Europe;
 and the kingdoms of France and Italy were shivered into
 fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But the
 Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and
 destroyed, while the union of the Germans has produced,
 under the name of an empire, a great system of a federative
 republic. In the frequent and at last the perpetual
 institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and
 the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by
 the three branches or colleges of the electors, the princes,
 and the free and Imperial cities of Germany. I. Seven of
 the most powerful feudatories were permitted to assume, with
 a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive privilege of
 choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors were the king
 of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of
 Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the three
 archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The
 college of princes and prelates purged themselves of a
 promiscuous multitude: they reduced to four representative
 votes the long series of independent counts, and excluded
 the nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as
 in the Polish diets, had appeared on horseback in the field
 of election. III. The pride of birth and dominion, of the
 sword and the mitre, wisely adopted the commons as the third
 branch of the legislature, and, in the progress of society,
 they were introduced about the same aera into the national
 assemblies of France England, and Germany. The Hanseatic
 League commanded the trade and navigation of the north: the
 confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and intercourse
 of the inland country; the influence of the cities has been
 adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative
 still invalidates the acts of the two superior colleges of
 electors and princes. (149)
 Weakness and poverty of the German emperor Charles IV. A.D. 1347-1378 . 
 It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the
 strongest light the state and contrast of the Roman empire
 of Germany, which no longer held, except on the borders of
 the Rhine and Danube, a single province of Trajan or
 Constantine. Their unworthy successors were the counts of
 Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh:
 the emperor Henry the Seventh procured for his son the crown
 of Bohemia, and his grandson Charles the Fourth was born
 among a people strange and barbarous in the estimation of
 the Germans themselves. (150) After the excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or promise of the
 vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the exile and
 captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the earth.
 The death of his competitors united the electoral college,
 and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and
 future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was
 prostituted to the Caesars of Germany and Greece. The
 German emperor was no more than the elective and impotent
 magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left
 him a village that he might call his own. His best
 prerogative was the right of presiding and proposing in the
 national senate, which was convened at his summons; and his
 native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the adjacent
 city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and the
 richest source of his revenue. A.D. 1355  The army with which he
 passed the Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the
 cathedral of St. Ambrose, Charles was crowned with the iron
 crown, which tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy; but
 he was admitted only with a peaceful train; the gates of the
 city were shut upon him; and the king of Italy was held a
 captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in
 the sovereignty of Milan. In the Vatican he was again
 crowned with the golden crown of the empire; but, in
 obedience to a secret treaty, the Roman emperor immediately
 withdrew, without reposing a single night within the walls
 of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, (151) whose fancy revived
 the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids
 the ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his
 contemporaries could observe, that the sole exercise of his
 authority was in the lucrative sale of privileges and
 titles. The gold of Italy secured the election of his son;
 but such was the shameful poverty of the Roman emperor, that
 his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of
 Worms, and was detained in the public inn, as a pledge or
 hostage for the payment of his expenses.

 His ostentation, A.D. 1356 . 
 From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent
 majesty of the same Charles in the diets of the empire. The
 golden bull, which fixes the Germanic constitution, is
 promulgated in the style of a sovereign and legislator. A
 hundred princes bowed before his throne, and exalted their
 own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded to
 their chief or minister. At the royal banquet, the
 hereditary great officers, the seven electors, who in rank
 and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn and
 domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple
 kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz,
 Cologne, and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of
 Germany, Italy, and Arles. The great marshal, on horseback,
 exercised his function with a silver measure of oats, which
 he emptied on the ground, and immediately dismounted to
 regulate the order of the guests The great steward, the
 count palatine of the Rhine, place the dishes on the table.
 The great chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburgh,
 presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and basin, to
 wash. The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was
 represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of Luxemburgh
 and Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great
 huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud
 chorus of horns and hounds. (152) Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to Germany alone: the hereditary
 monarchs of Europe confessed the preeminence of his rank and
 dignity: he was the first of the Christian princes, the
 temporal head of the great republic of the West: (153) to his
 person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he
 disputed with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating
 kings and assembling councils. The oracle of the civil law,
 the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of Charles the Fourth;
 and his school resounded with the doctrine, that the Roman
 emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth, from the
 rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was
 condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the
 gospel had pronounced,  Contrast of the power and modesty of Augustus . 
 If we annihilate the interval of time and space between
 Augustus and Charles, strong and striking will be the
 contrast between the two Caesars; the Bohemian who concealed
 his weakness under the mask of ostentation, and the Roman,
 who disguised his strength under the semblance of modesty.
 At the head of his victorious legions, in his reign over the
 sea and land, from the Nile and Euphrates to the Atlantic
 Ocean, Augustus professed himself the servant of the state
 and the equal of his fellow-citizens. The conqueror of Rome
 and her provinces assumed a popular and legal form of a
 censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will was the law of
 mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the
 voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their
 master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to
 administer the republic. In his dress, his domestics, (155)
 his titles, in all the offices of social life, Augustus
 maintained the character of a private Roman; and his most
 artful flatterers respected the secret of his absolute and
 perpetual monarchy.
