Young Edward, now in his twentieth year, was of a temper well fitted to

      make his way through such a scene of war, havoc, and devastation, as must

      conduct him to the full possession of that crown, which he claimed from

      hereditary right, but which he had assumed from the tumultuary election

      alone of his own party. He was bold, active, enterprising; and his

      hardness of heart and severity of character rendered him impregnable to

      all those movements of compassion which might relax his vigor in the

      prosecution of the most bloody revenges upon his enemies. The very

      commencement of his reign gave symptoms of his sanguinary disposition. A

      tradesman of London, who kept shop at the sign of the Crown, having said

      that he would make his son heir to the crown; this harmless pleasantry was

      interpreted to be spoken in derision of Edward’s assumed title; and he was

      condemned and executed for the offence.[*] Such an act of tyranny was a

      proper prelude to the events which ensued. The scaffold, as well as the

      field, incessantly streamed with the noblest blood of England, spilt in

      the quarrel between the two contending families, whose animosity was now

      become implacable. The people, divided in their affections, took different

      symbols of party: the partisans of the house of Lancaster chose the red

      rose as their mark of distinction;[**] those of York were denominated from

      the white; and these civil wars were thus known over Europe by the name of

      the quarrel between the two roses.

     

      The license in which Queen Margaret had been obliged to indulge her

      troops, infused great terror and aversion into the city of London, and all

      the southern parts of the kingdom; and as she there expected an obstinate

      resistance, she had prudently retired northwards among her own partisans.

      The same license, joined to the zeal of faction, soon brought great

      multitudes to her standard; and she was able, in a few days, to assemble

      an army sixty thousand strong in Yorkshire. The king and the earl of

      Warwick hastened, with an army of forty thousand men, to check her

      progress; and when they reached Pomfret, they despatched a body of troops,

      under the command of Lord Fitzwalter, to secure the passage of Ferrybridge

      over the River Are, which lay between them and the enemy. Fitzwalter took

      possession of the post assigned him; but was not able to maintain it

      against Lord Clifford, who attacked him with superior numbers. The

      Yorkists were chased back with great slaughter; and Lord Fitzwalter

      himself was slain in the action.[*] The earl of Warwick, dreading the

      consequences of this disaster, at a time when a decisive action was every

      hour expected, immediately ordered his horse to be brought him, which he

      stabbed before the whole army; and kissing the hilt of his sword, swore

      that he was determined to share the fate of the meanest soldier.[**] And

      to show the greater security, a proclamation was at the same time issued,

      giving to every one full liberty to retire, but menacing the severest

      punishment to those who should discover any symptoms of cowardice in the

      ensuing battle.[***] Lord Falconberg was sent to recover the post which

      had been lost: he passed the river some miles above Ferrybridge, and

      falling unexpectedly on Lord Clifford, revenged the former disaster by the

      defeat of the party and the death of their leader.[****]

     

      The hostile armies met at Touton; and a fierce and bloody battle ensued.

      While the Yorkists were advancing to the charge, there happened a great

      fall of snow, which, driving full in the faces of their enemies, blinded

      them; and this advantage was improved by a stratagem of Lord Falconberg’s.

      That nobleman ordered some infantry to advance before the line, and, after

      having sent a volley of flight-arrows, as they were called, amidst the

      enemy, immediately to retire. The Lancastrians, imagining that they were

      gotten within reach of the opposite army, discharged all their arrows,

      which thus fell short of the Yorkists.[*] After the quivers of the enemy

      were emptied, Edward advanced his line, and did execution with impunity on

      the dismayed Lancastrians: the bow, however, was soon laid aside, and the

      sword decided the combat, which ended in a total victory on the side of

      the Yorkists. Edward issued orders to give no quarter.[**] The routed army

      was pursued to Tadcaster with great bloodshed and confusion; and above

      thirty-six thousand men are computed to have fallen in the battle and

      pursuit:[***] among these were the earl of Westmoreland, and his brother

      Sir John Nevil, the earl of Northumberland, the Lords Dacres and Welles,

      and Sir Andrew Trollop.[****] The earl of Devonshire, who was now engaged

      in Henry’s party, was brought a prisoner to Edward; and was soon after

      beheaded by martial law at York. His head was fixed on a pole erected over

      a gate of that city; and the head of Duke Richard and that of the earl of

      Salisbury were taken down, and buried with their bodies. Henry and

      Margaret had remained at York during the action, but learning the defeat

      of their army, and being sensible that no place in England could now

      afford them shelter, they fled with great precipitation into Scotland.

      They were accompanied by the duke of Exeter, who, though he had married

      Edward’s sister, had taken part with the Lancastrians; and by Henry, duke

      of Somerset, who had commanded in the unfortunate battle of Touton, and

      who was the son of that nobleman killed in the first battle of St. Albans.

     

      Notwithstanding the great animosity which prevailed between the kingdoms,

      Scotland had never exerted itself with vigor, to take advantage either of

      the wars which England carried on with France, or of the civil commotions

      which arose between the contending families. James I., more laudably

      employed in civilizing his subjects, and taming them to the salutary yoke

      of law and justice, avoided all hostilities with foreign nations; and

      though he seemed interested to maintain a balance between France and

      England, he gave no further assistance to the former kingdom in its

      greatest distresses, than permitting, and perhaps encouraging, his

      subjects to enlist in the French service. After the murder of that

      excellent prince, the minority of his son and successor, James II., and

      the distractions incident to it, retained the Scots in the same state of

      neutrality; and the superiority visibly acquired by France, rendered it

      then unnecessary for her ally to interpose in her defence. But when the

      quarrel commenced between the houses of York and Lancaster, and became

      absolutely incurable but by the total extinction of one party, James, who

      had now risen to man’s estate, was tempted to seize the opportunity, and

      he endeavored to recover those places which the English had formerly

      conquered from his ancestors. He laid siege to the Castle of Roxburgh in

      1460, and had provided himself with a small train of artillery for that

      enterprise: but his cannon were so ill framed, that one of them burst as

      he was firing it, and put an end to his life in the flower of his age. His

      son and successor, James III., was also a minor on his accession: the

      usual distractions ensued in the government: the queen dowager, Anne of

      Gueldres, aspired to the regency: the family of Douglas opposed her

      pretensions: and Queen Margaret, when she fled into Scotland, found there

      a people little less divided by faction, than those by whom she had been

      expelled. Though she pleaded the connections between the royal family of

      Scotland and the house of Lancaster, by the young king’s grandmother, a

      daughter of the earl of Somerset, she could engage the Scottish council to

      go no further than to express their good wishes in her favor; but on her

      offer to deliver to them immediately the important fortress of Berwick,

      and to contract her son in marriage with a sister of King James, she found

      a better reception; and the Scots promised the assistance of their arms to

      reinstate her family upon the throne.[*] But as the danger from that

      quarter seemed not very urgent to Edward, he did not pursue the fugitive

      king and queen into their retreat; but returned to London, where a

      parliament was summoned for settling the government.

     

      On the meeting of this assembly, Edward found the good effects of his

      vigorous measure in assuming the crown, as well as of his victory at

      Touton, by which he had secured it;[**] the parliament no longer hesitated

      between the two families or proposed any of those ambiguous decisions

      which could only serve to perpetuate and inflame the animosities of party.

     

      They recognized the title of Edward, by hereditary descent, through the

      family of Mortimer; and declared that he was king by right, from the death

      of his father, who had also the same lawful title; and that he was in

      possession of the crown from the day that he assumed the government,

      tendered to him by the acclamations of the people.[*] They expressed their

      abhorrence of the usurpation and intrusion of the house of Lancaster,

      particularly that of the earl of Derby, otherwise called Henry IV.; which,

      they said, had been attended with every kind of disorder, the murder of

      the sovereign, and the oppression of the subject. They annulled every

      grant which had passed in those reigns; they reinstated the king in all

      the possessions which had belonged to the crown at the pretended

      deposition of Richard II.; and though they confirmed judicial deeds and

      the decrees of inferior courts, they reversed all attainders passed in any

      pretended parliament; particularly the attainder of the earl of Cambridge,

      the king’s grandfather; as well as that of the earls of Salisbury and

      Glocester, and of Lord Lumley, who had been forfeited for adhering to

      Richard II.[**]

     

      Many of these votes were the result of the usual violence of party: the

      common sense of mankind, in more peaceable times, repealed them: and the

      statutes of the house of Lancaster, being the deeds of an established

      government, and enacted by princes long possessed of authority, have

      always been held as valid and obligatory. The parliament, however, in

      subverting such deep foundations, had still the pretence of replacing the

      government on its ancient and natural basis: but in their subsequent

      measures, they were more guided by revenge, at least by the views of

      convenience, than by the maxims of equity and justice. They passed an act

      of forfeiture and attainder against Henry VI. and Queen Margaret and their

      infant son Prince Edward: the same act was extended to the dukes of

      Somerset and Exeter; to the earls of Northumberland, Devonshire, Pembroke,

      Wilts; to the Viscount Beaumont; the Lords Roos, Nevil, Clifford, Welles,

      Dacre, Gray of Rugemont, Hungerford; to Alexander Hedie, Nicholas Latimer,

      Edmond Mountfort, John Heron, and many other persons of distinction.[***]

     

      The parliament vested the estates of all these attainted persons in the

      crown, though their sole crime was the adhering to a prince whom every

      individual of the parliament had long recognized, and whom that very king

      himself, who was now seated on the throne, had acknowledged and obeyed as

      his lawful sovereign.

     

      The necessity of supporting the government established will more fully

      justify some other acts of violence, though the method of conducting them

      may still appear exceptionable. John, earl of Oxford, and his son Aubrey

      de Vere were detected in a correspondence with Margaret, were tried by

      martial law before the constable, were condemned and executed.[*] Sir

      William Tyrrel, Sir Thomas Tudenham, and John Montgomery were convicted in

      the same arbitrary court; were executed, and their estates forfeited. This

      introduction of martial law into civil government was a high strain of

      prerogative; which, were it not for the violence of the times, would

      probably have appeared exceptionable to a nation so jealous of their

      liberties as the English were now become.[**] 18 It was impossible but

      such a great and sudden revolution must leave the roots of discontent and

      dissatisfaction in the subject, which would require great art, or, in lieu

      of it, great violence, to extirpate them. The latter was more suitable to

      the genius of the nation in that uncultivated age.

     

      But the new establishment still seemed precarious and uncertain; not only

      from the domestic discontents of the people, but from the efforts of

      foreign powers. Lewis, the eleventh of the name, had succeeded to his

      father, Charles, in 1460; and was led, from the obvious motives of

      national interest, to feed the flames of civil discord among such

      dangerous neighbors, by giving support to the weaker party. But the

      intriguing and politic genius of this prince was here checked by itself:

      having attempted to subdue the independent spirit of his own vassals, he

      had excited such an opposition at home, as prevented him from making all

      the advantage, which the opportunity afforded, of the dissensions among

      the English.

     

      1462.

     

      He sent, however, a small body to Henry’s assistance under Varenne,

      seneschal of Normandy;[***] who landed in Northumberland, and got

      possession of the Castle of Alnwick; but as the indefatigable Margaret

      went in person to France, where she solicited larger supplies and promised

      Lewis to deliver up Calais, if her family should by his means be restored

      to the throne of England; he was induced to send along with her a body of

      two thousand men at arms, which enabled her to take the field, and to make

      an inroad into England.

     

      1464.

     

      Though reÃ«nforced by a numerous train of adventurers from Scotland, and by

      many partisans of the family of Lancaster she received a check at

      Hedgley-more from Lord Montacute, or Montague, brother to the earl of

      Warwick, and warden of the east marches between Scotland and England.

      Montague was so encouraged with this success, that, while a numerous

      reÃ«nforcement was on their march to join him by orders from Edward, he yet

      ventured, with his own troops alone, to attack the Lancastrians at Hexham;

      and he obtained a complete victory over them. The duke of Somerset, the

      Lords Roos and Hungerford, were taken in the pursuit, and immediately

      beheaded by martial law at Hexham. Summary justice was in like manner

      executed at Newcastle on Sir Humphrey Nevil, and several other gentlemen.

      All those who were spared in the field, suffered on the scaffold; and the

      utter extermination of their adversaries was now become the plain object

      of the York party; a conduct which received but too plausible an apology

      from the preceding practice of the Lancastrians.

     

      The fate of the unfortunate royal family, after this defeat, was singular.

      Margaret, flying with her son into a forest, where she endeavored to

      conceal herself, was beset, during the darkness of the night, by robbers,

      who, either ignorant or regardless of her quality, despoiled her of her

      rings and jewels, and treated her with the utmost indignity. The partition

      of this rich booty raised a quarrel among them; and while their attention

      was thus engaged, she took the opportunity of making her escape with her

      son into the thickest of the forest where she wandered for some time,

      overspent with hunger and fatigue, and sunk with terror and affliction.

      While in this wretched condition, she saw a robber approach with his naked

      sword; and finding that she had no means of escape, she suddenly embraced

      the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his faith and

      generosity. She advanced towards him; and presenting to him the young

      prince, called out to him, “Here, my friend, I commit to your care the

      safety of your king’s son.” The man, whose humanity and generous spirit

      had been obscured, not entirely lost, by his vicious course of life, was

      struck with the singularity of the event, was charmed with the confidence

      reposed in him, and vowed, not only to abstain from all injury against the

      princess, but to devote himself entirely to her service.[*] By his means

      she dwelt some time concealed in the forest, and was at last conducted to

      the sea-coast, whence she made her escape into Flanders. She passed thence

      into her father’s court, where she lived several years in privacy and

      retirement. Her husband was not so fortunate or so dexterous in finding

      the means of escape. Some of his friends took him under their protection,

      and conveyed him into Lancashire, where he remained concealed during a

      twelvemonth; but he was at last detected, delivered up to Edward, and

      thrown into the Tower.[**] The safety of his person was owing less to the

      generosity of his enemies, than to the contempt which they had entertained

      of his courage and his understanding.

     

      The imprisonment of Henry, the expulsion of Margaret, the execution and

      confiscation of all the most eminent Lancastrians, seemed to give full

      security to Edward’s government; whose title by blood, being now

      recognized by parliament, and universally submitted to by the people, was

      no longer in danger of being impeached by any antagonist. In this

      prosperous situation, the king delivered himself up, without control, to

      those pleasures which his youth, his high fortune, and his natural temper

      invited him to enjoy; and the cares of royalty were less attended to than

      the dissipation of amusement, or the allurements of passion. The cruel and

      unrelenting spirit of Edward, though inured to the ferocity of civil wars,

      was at the same time extremely devoted to the softer passions, which,

      without mitigating his severe temper, maintained a great influence over

      him, and shared his attachment with the pursuits of ambition and the

      thirst of military glory. During the present interval of peace, he lived

      in the most familiar and sociable manner with his subjects,[***]

      particularly with the Londoners; and the beauty of his person, as well as

      the gallantry of his address, which, even unassisted by his royal dignity,

      would have rendered him acceptable to the fair, facilitated all his

      applications for their favor.

     

      This easy and pleasurable course of life augmented every day his

      popularity among all ranks of men: he was the peculiar favorite of the

      young and gay of both sexes. The disposition of the English little

      addicted to jealousy, kept them from taking umbrage at these liberties:

      and his indulgence in amusements, while it gratified his inclination, was

      thus become, without design, a means of supporting and securing his

      government. But as it is difficult to confine the ruling passion within

      strict rules of prudence, the amorous temper of Edward led him into a

      snare, which proved fatal to his repose, and to the stability of his

      throne.

     

      Jaqueline of Luxembourg, duchess of Bedford, had, after her husband’s

      death, so far sacrificed her ambition to love, that she espoused, in

      second marriage, Sir Richard Woodeville a private gentleman, to whom she

      bore several children; and among the rest, Elizabeth, who was remarkable

      for the grace and beauty of her person, as well as for other amiable

      accomplishments. This young lady had married Sir John Gray of Groby, by

      whom she had children; and her husband being slain in the second battle of

      St. Albans, fighting on the side of Lancaster, and his estate being for

      that reason confiscated, his widow retired to live with her father, at his

      seat of Grafton, in Northamptonshire. The king came accidentally to the

      house after a hunting party, in order to pay a visit to the duchess of

      Bedford; and as the occasion seemed favorable for obtaining some grace

      from this gallant monarch, the young widow flung herself at his feet, and

      with many tears entreated him to take pity on her impoverished and

      distressed children. The sight of so much beauty in affliction strongly

      affected the amorous Edward; love stole sensibly into his heart under the

      guise of compassion; and her sorrow, so becoming a virtuous matron, made

      his esteem and regard quickly correspond to his affection. He raised her

      from the ground with assurances of favor; he found his passion increase

      every moment, by the conversation of the amiable object; and he was soon

      reduced, in his turn, to the posture and style of a supplicant at the feet

      of Elizabeth. But the lady, either averse to dishonorable love from a

      sense of duty, or perceiving that the impression which she had made was so

      deep as to give her hopes of obtaining the highest elevation, obstinately

      refused to gratify his passion; and all the endearments, caresses, and

      importunities of the young and amiable Edward proved fruitless against her

      rigid and inflexible virtue. His passion, irritated by opposition, and

      increased by his veneration for such honorable sentiments carried him at

      last beyond all bounds of reason and he offered to share his throne, as

      well as his heart, with the woman whose beauty of person and dignity of

      character seemed so well to entitle her to both. The marriage was

      privately celebrated at Grafton:[**] the secret was carefully kept for

      some time: no one suspected that so libertine a prince could sacrifice so

      much to a romantic passion; and there were, in particular, strong reasons,

      which, at that time, rendered this step, to the highest degree, dangerous

      and imprudent.

     

      The king, desirous to secure his throne, as well by the prospect of issue

      as by foreign alliances, had, a little before, determined to make

      application to some neighboring princess, and he had cast his eye on Bona

      of Savoy, sister to the queen of France, who, he hoped, would by her

      marriage insure him the friendship of that power, which was alone both

      able and inclined to give support and assistance to his rival. To render

      the negotiation more successful, the earl of Warwick had been despatched

      to Paris, where the princess then resided; he had demanded Bona in

      marriage for the king; his proposals had been accepted; the treaty was

      fully concluded; and nothing remained but the ratification of the terms

      agreed on, and the bringing over the princess to England.[**] But when the

      secret of Edward’s marriage broke out, the haughty earl, deeming himself

      affronted, both by being employed in this fruitless negotiation, and by

      being kept a stranger to the king’s intentions, who had owed every thing

      to his friendship, immediately returned to England, inflamed with rage and

      indignation. The influence of passion over so young a man as Edward, might

      have served as an excuse for his imprudent conduct, had he deigned to

      acknowledge his error, or had pleaded his weakness as an apology; but his

      faulty shame or pride prevented him from so much as mentioning the matter

      to Warwick; and that nobleman was allowed to depart the court, full of the

      same ill humor and discontent which he brought to it.

     

      1466.

     

      Every incident now tended to widen the breach between the king and this

      powerful subject. The queen, who lost not her influence by marriage, was

      equally solicitous to draw every grace and favor to her own friends and

      kindred, and to exclude those of the earl, whom she regarded as her

      mmortal enemy. Her father was created earl of Rivers: he was made

      treasurer in the room of Lord Mountjoy:[*] he was invested in the office

      of constable for life; and his son received the survivance of that high

      dignity.[**] The same young nobleman was married to the only daughter of

      Lord Scales, enjoyed the great estate of that family, and had the title of

      Scales conferred upon him. Catharine, the queen’s sister, was married to

      the young duke of Buckingham, who was a ward of the crown:[***] Mary,

      another of her sisters espoused William Herbert, created earl of

      Huntingdon: Anne, a third sister, was given in marriage to the son and

      heir of Gray, Lord Ruthyn, created earl of Kent.[****] The daughter and

      heir of the duke of Exeter, who was also the king’s niece, was contracted

      to Sir Thomas Gray, one of the queen’s sons by her former husband; and as

      Lord Montague was treating of a marriage between his son and this lady,

      the preference given to young Gray was deemed an injury and affront to the

      whole family of Nevil.

     

      The earl of Warwick could not suffer with patience the least diminution of

      that credit which he had long enjoyed, and which he thought he had merited

      by such important services. Though he had received so many grants from the

      crown, that the revenue arising from them amounted, besides his

      patrimonial estate, to eighty thousand crowns a year, according to the

      computation of Philip de Comines,[*****] his ambitious spirit was still

      dissatisfied, so long as he saw others surpass him in authority and

      influence with the king.[******] Edward also, jealous of that power which

      had supported him and which he himself had contributed still higher to

      exalt, was well pleased to raise up rivals in credit to the earl of

      Warwick; and he justified, by this political view, his extreme partiality

      to the queen’s kindred. But the nobility of England, envying the sudden

      growth of the Woodevilles,[*******] were more inclined to take part with

      Warwick’s discontent, to whose grandeur they were already accustomed, and

      who had reconciled them to his superiority by his gracious and popular

      manners.

     

      And as Edward obtained from parliament a general resumption of all grants,

      which he had made since his accession, and which had extremely

      impoverished the crown,[*] this act, though it passed with some

      exceptions, particularly one in favor of the earl of Warwick, gave a

      general alarm to the nobility, and disgusted many, even zealous partisans

      of the family of York.

     

      But the most considerable associate that Warwick acquired to his party,

      was George, duke of Clarence, the king’s second brother. This prince

      deemed himself no less injured than the other grandees, by the

      uncontrolled influence of the queen and her relations; and as his fortunes

      were still left upon a precarious footing, while theirs were fully

      established, this neglect, joined to his unquiet and restless spirit,

      inclined him to give countenance to all the malecontents.[**] The

      favorable opportunity of gaining him was espied by the earl of Warwick,

      who offered him in marriage his elder daughter, and coheir of his immense

      fortunes; a settlement which, as it was superior to any that the king

      himself could confer upon him, immediately attached him to the party of

      the earl.[***] Thus an extensive and dangerous combination was insensibly

      formed against Edward and his ministry. Though the immediate object of the

      malecontents was not to overturn the throne, it was difficult to foresee

      the extremities to which they might be carried: and as opposition to

      government was usually in those ages prosecuted by force of arms, civil

      convulsions and disorders were likely to be soon the result of these

      intrigues and confederacies.

     

      While this cloud was gathering at home, Edward carried his views abroad,

      and endeavored to secure himself against his factious nobility, by

      entering into foreign alliances. The dark and dangerous ambition of Lewis

      XI., the more it was known, the greater alarm it excited among his

      neighbors and vassals; and as it was supported by great abilities, and

      unrestrained by any principle of faith or humanity, they found no security

      to themselves but by a jealous combination against him. Philip, duke of

      Burgundy, was now dead: his rich and extensive dominions were devolved to

      Charles, his only son, whose martial disposition acquired him the surname

      of Bold, and whose ambition, more outrageous than that of Lewis, but

      seconded by less power and policy, was regarded with a more favorable eye

      by the other potentates of Europe.

     

      The opposition of interests, and still more a natural antipathy of

      character, produced a declared animosity between these bad princes; and

      Edward was thus secure of the sincere attachment of either of them, for

      whom he should choose to declare himself. The duke of Burgundy, being

      descended by his mother, a daughter of Portugal, from John of Gaunt, was

      naturally inclined to favor the house of Lancaster:[*] but this

      consideration was easily overbalanced by political motives; and Charles,

      perceiving the interests of that house to be extremely decayed in England,

      sent over his natural brother, commonly called the Bastard of Burgundy, to

      carry in his name proposals of marriage to Margaret, the king’s sister.

     

      1468.

     

      The alliance of Burgundy was more popular among the English than that of

      France; the commercial interests of the two nations invited the princes to

      a close union; their common jealousy of Lewis was a natural cement between

      them; and Edward, pleased with strengthening himself by so potent a

      confederate, soon concluded the alliance, and bestowed his sister upon

      Charles.[**] A league, which Edward at the same time concluded with the

      duke of Brittany, seemed both to increase his security, and to open to him

      the prospect of rivalling his predecessors in those foreign conquests,

      which, however short-lived and unprofitable, had rendered their reigns so

      popular and illustrious.[***]

     

      1469.

     

      But whatever ambitious schemes the king might have built on these

      alliances, they were soon frustrated by intestine commotions, which

      engrossed all his attention. These disorders probably arose not

      immediately from the intrigues of the earl of Warwick, but from accident,

      aided by the turbulent spirit of the age, by the general humor of

      discontent which that popular nobleman had instilled into the nation, and

      perhaps by some remains of attachment to the house of Lancaster. The

      hospital of St. Leonard’s, near York, had received, from an ancient grant

      of King Athelstane, a right of levying a thrave of corn upon every

      plough-land in the county; and as these charitable establishments are

      liable to abuse, the country people complained, that the revenue of the

      hospital was no longer expended for the relief of the poor, but was

      secreted by the managers, and employed to their private purposes.

     

      After long repining at the contribution, they refused payment:

      ecclesiastical and civil censures were issued against them, their goods

      were distrained, and their persons thrown into jail: till, as their ill

      humor daily increased, they rose in arms; fell upon the officers of the

      hospital, whom they put to the sword; and proceeded in a body, fifteen

      thousand strong, to the gates of York. Lord Montague, who commanded in

      those parts, opposed himself to their progress; and having been so

      fortunate in a skirmish as to seize Robert Hulderne, their leader, he

      ordered him immediately to be led to execution, according to the practice

      of the times. The rebels, however, still continued in arms; and being soon

      headed by men of greater distinction: Sir Henry Nevil, son of Lord

      Latimer, and Sir John Coniers, they advanced southwards, and began to

      appear formidable to government. Herbert, earl of Pembroke, who had

      received that title on the forfeiture of Jasper Tudor, was ordered by

      Edward to march against them at the head of a body of Welshmen; and he was

      joined by five thousand archers, under the command of Stafford, earl of

      Devonshire, who had succeeded in that title to the family of Courtney,

      which had also been attainted. But a trivial difference about quarters

      having begotten an animosity between these two noblemen, the earl of

      Devonshire retired with his archers, and left Pembroke alone to encounter

      the rebels. The two armies approached each other near Banbury; and

      Pembroke, having prevailed in a skirmish, and having taken Sir John Nevil

      prisoner, ordered him immediately to be put to death, without any form of

      process. This execution enraged without terrifying the rebels: they

      attacked the Welsh army, routed them, put them to the sword without mercy;

      and having seized Pembroke, they took immediate revenge upon him for the

      death of their leader. The king, imputing this misfortune to the earl of

      Devonshire, who had deserted Pembroke, ordered him to be executed in a

      like summary manner. But these speedy executions, or rather open murders,

      did not stop there: the northern rebels, sending a party to Grafton,

      seized the earl of Rivers and his son John; men who had become obnoxious

      by their near relation to the king, and his partiality towards them: and

      they were immediately executed by orders from Sir John Coniers.[*]

     

      There is no part of English history since the conquest so obscure, so

      uncertain, so little authentic or consistent, as that of the wars between

      the two “roses:” historians differ about many material circumstances; some

      events of the utmost consequence, in which they almost all agree, are

      incredible, and contradicted by records;[*] 19 and it is remarkable,

      that this profound darkness falls upon us just on the eve of the

      restoration of letters, and when the art of printing was already known in

      Europe. All we can distinguish with certainty through the deep cloud which

      covers that period, is a scene of horror and bloodshed: savage manners,

      arbitrary executions, and treacherous, dishonorable conduct in all

      parties. There is no possibility, for instance, of accounting for the

      views and intentions of the earl of Warwick at this time. It is agreed

      that he resided, together with his son-in-law, the duke of Clarence, in

      his government of Calais during the commencement of this rebellion; and

      that his brother Montague acted with vigor against the northern rebels. We

      may thence presume, that the insurrection had not proceeded from the

      secret counsels and instigation of Warwick; though the murder committed by

      the rebels on the earl of Rivers, his capital enemy, forms, on the other

      hand, a violent presumption against him. He and Clarence came over to

      England, offered their service to Edward, were received without any

      suspicion, were intrusted by him in the highest commands,[**] and still

      persevered in their fidelity. Soon after, we find the rebels quieted and

      dispersed by a general pardon granted by Edward from the advice of the

      earl of Warwick: but why so courageous a prince, if secure of Warwick’s

      fidelity, should have granted a general pardon to men who had been guilty

      of such violent and personal outrages against him, is not intelligible;

      nor why that nobleman, if unfaithful, should have endeavored to appease a

      rebellion of which he was able to make such advantages. But it appears,

      that after this insurrection, there was an interval of peace, during which

      the king loaded the family of Nevil with honors and favors of the highest

      nature: he made Lord Montague a marquis, by the same name: he created his

      son George duke of Bedford;[***] he publicly declared his intention of

      marrying that young nobleman to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, who, as he

      had yet no sons, was presumptive heir of the crown: yet we find that soon

      after, being invited to a feast by the archbishop of York, a younger

      brother of Warwick and Montague, he entertained a sudden suspicion that

      they intended to seize his person or to murder him: and he abruptly left

      the entertainment.[****]

     

      1470.

     

      Soon after, there broke out another rebellion, which is as unaccountable

      as all the preceding events; chiefly because no sufficient reason is

      assigned for it, and because, so far as appears, the family of Nevil had

      no hand in exciting and fomenting it. It arose in Lincolnshire, and was

      headed by Sir Robert Welles, son to the lord of that name. The army of the

      rebels amounted to thirty thousand men; but Lord Welles himself, far from

      giving countenance to them, fled into a sanctuary, in order to secure his

      person against the king’s anger or suspicions. He was allured from this

      retreat by a promise of safety; and was soon after, notwithstanding this

      assurance, beheaded, along with Sir Thomas Dymoc, by orders from

      Edward.[*] The king fought a battle with the rebels, defeated them, took

      Sir Robert Welles and Sir Thomas Launde prisoners, and ordered them

      immediately to be beheaded.

     

      Edward, during these transactions, had entertained so little jealousy of

      the earl of Warwick or duke of Clarence, that he sent them with

      commissions of array to levy forces against the rebels:[**] but these

      malecontents, as soon as they left the court, raised troops in their own

      name, issued declarations against the government, and complained of

      grievances, oppressions, and bad ministers. The unexpected defeat of

      Welles disconcerted all their measures; and they retired northwards into

      Lancashire, where they expected to be joined by Lord Stanley, who had

      married the earl of Warwick’s sister. But as that nobleman refused all

      concurrence with them, and as Lord Montague also remained quiet in

      Yorkshire, they were obliged to disband their army, and to fly into

      Devonshire, where they embarked and made sail towards Calais.[***]

     

      The deputy governor, whom Warwick had left at Calais, was one Vaucler, a

      Gascon, who, seeing the earl return in this miserable condition, refused

      him admittance; and would not so much as permit the duchess of Clarence to

      land, though, a few days before, she had been delivered on shipboard of a

      son, and was at that time extremely disordered by sickness. With

      difficulty he would allow a few flagons of wine to be carried to the ship

      for the use of the ladies: but as he was a man of sagacity, and well

      acquainted with the revolutions to which England was subject, he secretly

      apologized to Warwick for this appearance of infidelity, and represented

      it as proceeding entirely from zeal for his service. He said that the

      fortress was ill supplied with provisions; that he could not depend on the

      attachment of the garrison; that the inhabitants, who lived by the English

      commerce, would certainly declare for the established government; that the

      place was at present unable to resist the power of England on the one

      hand, and that of the duke of Burgundy on the other; and that, by seeming

      to declare for Edward, he would acquire the confidence of that prince, and

      still keep it in his power, when it should become safe and prudent, to

      restore Calais to its ancient master.[*] It is uncertain whether Warwick

      was satisfied with this apology, or suspected a double infidelity in

      Vaucler; but he feigned to be entirely convinced by him; and having seized

      some Flemish vessels which he found lying off Calais, he immediately made

      sail towards France.

     

      The king of France, uneasy at the close conjunction between Edward and the

      duke of Burgundy, received with the greatest demonstrations of regard the

      unfortunate Warwick,[**] with whom he had formerly maintained a secret

      correspondence, and whom he hoped still to make his instrument in

      overturning the government of England, and reÃ«stablishing the house of

      Lancaster.

     

      No animosity was ever greater than that which had long prevailed between

      that house and the earl of Warwick. His father had been executed by orders

      from Margaret: he himself had twice reduced Henry to captivity, had

      banished the queen, had put to death all their most zealous partisans

      either in the field or on the scaffold, and had occasioned innumerable

      ills to that unhappy family. For this reason, believing that such

      inveterate rancor could never admit of any cordial reconciliation, he had

      not mentioned Henry’s name when he took arms against Edward; and he rather

      endeavored to prevail by means of his own adherents, than revive a party

      which he sincerely hated. But his present distresses and the entreaties of

      Lewis made him hearken to terms of accommodation; and Margaret being sent

      for from Angers, where she then resided, an agreement was, from common

      interest, soon concluded between them. It was stipulated, that Warwick

      should espouse the cause of Henry, and endeavor to restore him to liberty,

      and to reÃ«stablish him on the throne; that the administration of the

      government, during the minority of young Edward, Henry’s son, should be

      intrusted conjointly to the earl of Warwick and the duke of Clarence; that

      Prince Edward should marry the Lady Anne, second daughter of that

      nobleman; and that the crown, in case of the failure of male issue in that

      prince, should descend to the duke of Clarence, to the entire exclusion of

      King Edward and his posterity. Never was confederacy, on all sides, less

      natural, or more evidently the work of necessity: but Warwick hoped, that

      all former passions of the Lancastrians might be lost in present political

      views; and that, at worst, the independent power of his family, and the

      affections of the people, would suffice to give him security, and enable

      him to exact the full performance of all the conditions agreed on. The

      marriage of Prince Edward with the Lady Anne was immediately celebrated in

      France.

     

      Edward foresaw that it would be easy to dissolve an alliance composed of

      such discordant parts. For this purpose, he sent over a lady of great

      sagacity and address, who belonged to the train of the duchess of

      Clarence, and who, under color of attending her mistress, was empowered to

      negotiate with the duke, and to renew the connections of that prince with

      his own family.[*] She represented to Clarence, that he had unwarily, to

      his own ruin, become the instrument of Warwick’s vengeance, and had thrown

      himself entirely in the power of his most inveterate enemies; that the

      mortal injuries which the one royal family had suffered from the other,

      were now past all forgiveness, and no imaginary union of interests could

      ever suffice to obliterate them; that even if the leaders were willing to

      forget past offences, the animosity of their adherents would prevent a

      sincere coalition of parties, and would, in spite of all temporary and

      verbal agreements, preserve an eternal opposition of measures between

      them; and that a prince who deserted his own kindred, and joined the

      murderers of his father, left himself single, without friends, without

      protection, and would not, when misfortunes inevitably fell upon him, be

      so much as entitled to any pity or regard from the rest of mankind.

     

      Clarence was only one and twenty years of age, and seems to have possessed

      but a slender capacity; yet could he easily see the force of these

      reasons; and, upon the promise of forgiveness from his brother, he

      secretly engaged, on a favorable opportunity, to desert the earl of

      Warwick, and abandon the Lancastrian party.

     

      During this negotiation, Warwick was secretly carrying on a correspondence

      of the same nature with his brother, the marquis of Montague, who was

      entirely trusted by Edward; and like motives produced a like resolution in

      that nobleman. The marquis, also, that he might render the projected blow

      the more deadly and incurable, resolved, on his side, to watch a favorable

      opportunity for committing his perfidy, and still to maintain the

      appearance of being a zealous adherent to the house of York.

     

      After these mutual snares were thus carefully laid, the decision of the

      quarrel advanced apace. Lewis prepared a fleet to escort the earl of

      Warwick, and granted him a supply of men and money.[*] The duke of

      Burgundy, on the other hand, enraged at that nobleman for his seizure of

      the Flemish vessels before Calais, and anxious to support the reigning

      family in England, with whom his own interests were now connected, fitted

      out a larger fleet, with which he guarded the Channel: and he incessantly

      warned his brother-in-law of the imminent perils to which he was exposed.

      But Edward, though always brave and often active, had little foresight or

      penetration. He was not sensible of his danger; he made no suitable

      preparations against the earl of Warwick;[**] he even said that the duke

      might spare himself the trouble of guarding the seas, and that he wished

      for nothing more than to see Warwick set foot on English ground.[***] A

      vain confidence in his own prowess, joined to the immoderate love of

      pleasure, had made him incapable of all sound reason and reflection.

     

      The event soon happened, of which Edward seemed so desirous. A storm

      dispersed the Flemish navy, and left the sea open to Warwick.[****] That

      nobleman seized the opportunity, and setting sail, quickly landed at

      Dartmouth with the duke of Clarence, the earls of Oxford and Pembroke, and

      a small body of troops, while the king was in the north, engaged in

      suppressing an insurrection which had been raised by Lord Fitz-Hugh,

      brother-in-law to Warwick.

     

      The scene which ensues resembles more the fiction of a poem or romance

      than an event in true history. The prodigious popularity of Warwick,[*]

      the zeal of the Lancastrian party, the spirit of discontent with which

      many were infected, and the general instability of the English nation,

      occasioned by the late frequent revolutions, drew such multitudes to his

      standard, that in a very few days his army amounted to sixty thousand men

      and was continually increasing. Edward hastened southwards to encounter

      him; and the two armies approached each other near Nottingham, where a

      decisive action was every hour expected. The rapidity of Warwick’s

      progress had incapacitated the duke of Clarence from executing his plan of

      treachery; and the marquis of Montague had here the opportunity of

      striking the first blow. He communicated the design to his adherents, who

      promised him their concurrence: they took to arms in the night-time, and

      hastened with loud acclamations to Edward’s quarters; the king was alarmed

      at the noise, and starting from bed, heard the cry of war usually employed

      by the Lancastrian party. Lord Hastings, his chamberlain, informed him of

      the danger, and urged him to make his escape by speedy flight from an army

      where he had so many concealed enemies, and where few seemed zealously

      attached to his service. He had just time to get on horseback, and to

      hurry with a small retinue to Lynne, in Norfolk, where he luckily found

      some ships ready, on board of which he instantly embarked.[**] And after

      this manner the earl of Warwick, in no longer space than eleven days after

      his first landing, was left entire master of the kingdom.

     

      But Edward’s danger did not end with his embarkation. The Easterlings or

      Hanse Towns were then at war both with France and England; and some ships

      of these people, hovering on the English coast, espied the king’s vessels,

      and gave chase to them; nor was it without extreme difficulty that he made

      his escape into the port of Alcmaer, in Holland. He had fled from England

      with such precipitation, that he had carried nothing of value along with

      him; and the only reward which he could bestow on the captain of the

      vessel that brought him over, was a robe lined with sables; promising him

      an ample recompense if fortune should ever become more propitious to

      him.[*]

     

      It is not likely that Edward could be very fond of presenting himself in

      this lamentable plight before the duke of Burgundy; and that having so

      suddenly, after his mighty vaunts, lost all footing in his own kingdom, he

      could be insensible to the ridicule which must attend him in the eyes of

      that prince. The duke, on his part, was no less embarrassed how he should

      receive the dethroned monarch. As he had ever borne a greater affection to

      the house of Lancaster than to that of York, nothing but political views

      had engaged him to contract an alliance with the latter; and he foresaw,

      that probably the revolution in England would now turn this alliance

      against him, and render the reigning family his implacable and jealous

      enemy. For this reason, when the first rumor of that event reached him,

      attended with the circumstance of Edward’s death, he seemed rather pleased

      with the catastrophe; and it was no agreeable disappointment to find, that

      he must either undergo the burden of supporting an exiled prince, or the

      dishonor of abandoning so near a relation. He began already to say, that

      his connections were with the kingdom of England, not with the king; and

      it was indifferent to him whether the name of Edward or that of Henry were

      employed in the articles of treaty. These sentiments were continually

      strengthened by the subsequent events. Vaucler, the deputy-governor of

      Calais, though he had been confirmed in his command by Edward, and had

      even received a pension from the duke of Burgundy on account of his

      fidelity to the crown, no sooner saw his old master, Warwick, reinstated

      in authority, than he declared for him, and with great demonstrations of

      zeal and attachment, put the whole garrison in his livery. And the

      intelligence which the duke received every day from England, seemed to

      promise an entire and full settlement in the family of Lancaster.

     

      Immediately after Edward’s flight had left the kingdom at Warwick’s

      disposal, that nobleman hastened to London; and taking Henry from his

      confinement in the Tower, into which he himself had been the chief cause

      of throwing him, he proclaimed him king with great solemnity. A parliament

      was summoned in the name of that prince, to meet at Westminster, and as

      this assembly could pretend to no liberty while surrounded by such enraged

      and insolent victors, governed by such an impetuous spirit as Warwick,

      their votes were entirely dictated by the ruling faction. The treaty with

      Margaret was here fully executed: Henry was recognized as lawful king; but

      his incapacity for government being avowed, the regency was intrusted to

      Warwick and Clarence till the majority of Prince Edward; and in default of

      that prince’s issue, Clarence was declared successor to the crown. The

      usual business also of reversals went on without opposition: every statute

      made during the reign of Edward was repealed; that prince was declared to

      be a usurper; he and his adherents were attainted; and in particular

      Richard, duke of Glocester, his younger brother: all the attainders of the

      Lancastrians, the dukes of Somerset and Exeter, the earls of Richmond,

      Pembroke, Oxford, and Ormond, were reversed; and every one was restored

      who had lost either honors or fortunes by his former adherence to the

      cause of Henry.

     

      The ruling party were more sparing in their executions than was usual

      after any revolution during those violent times. The only victim of

      distinction was John Tibetot, earl of Worcester. This accomplished person,

      born in an age and nation where the nobility valued themselves on

      ignorance as their privilege, and left learning to monks and

      schoolmasters, for whom indeed the spurious erudition that prevailed was

      best fitted, had been struck with the first rays of true science, which

      began to penetrate from the south, and had been zealous, by his

      exhortation and example, to propagate the love of letters among his

      unpolished countrymen. It is pretended, that knowledge had not produced on

      this nobleman himself the effect which naturally attends it, of humanizing

      the temper and softening the heart;[*] and that he had enraged the

      Lancastrians against him by the severities which he exercised upon them

      during the prevalence of his own party.

     

      He endeavored to conceal himself after the flight of Edward, but was

      caught on the top of a tree in the forest of Weybridge, was conducted to

      London, tried before the earl of Oxford, condemned, and executed. All the

      other considerable Yorkists either fled beyond sea, or took shelter in

      sanctuaries, where the ecclesiastical privileges afforded them protection.

      In London alone it is computed that no less than two thousand persons

      saved themselves in this manner;[*] and among the rest, Edward’s queen,

      who was there delivered of a son, called by his father’s name.[**]

     

      Queen Margaret, the other rival queen, had not yet appeared in England,

      but on receiving intelligence of Warwick’s success, was preparing with

      Prince Edward for her journey. All the banished Lancastrians flocked to

      her; and, among the rest, the duke of Somerset, son of the duke beheaded

      after the battle of Hexham. This nobleman, who had long been regarded as

      the head of the party, had fled into the Low Countries on the discomfiture

      of his friends; and as he concealed his name and quality, he had there

      languished in extreme indigence. Philip de Comines tells us,[***] that he

      himself saw him, as well as the duke of Exeter, in a condition no better

      than that of a common beggar; till being discovered by Philip, duke of

      Burgundy, they had small pensions allotted them, and were living in

      silence and obscurity when the success of their party called them from

      their retreat. But both Somerset and Margaret were detained by contrary

      winds from reaching England,[****] till a new revolution in that kingdom,

      no less sudden and surprising than the former, threw them into greater

      misery than that from which they had just emerged.

     

      Though the duke of Burgundy, by neglecting Edward, and paying court to the

      established government, had endeavored to conciliate the friendship of the

      Lancastrians, he found that he had not succeeded to his wish; and the

      connections between the king of France and the earl of Warwick still held

      him in great anxiety.[*****] This nobleman, too hastily regarding Charles

      as a determined enemy, had sent over to Calais a body of four thousand

      men, who made inroads into the Low Countries;[******] and the duke of

      Burgundy saw himself in danger of being overwhelmed by the united arms of

      England and of France. He resolved therefore to grant some assistance to

      his brother-in-law; but in such a covert manner as should give the least

      offence possible to the English government.

     

      1471.

     

      He equipped four large vessels, in the name of some private merchants, at

      Terveer, in Zealand; and causing fourteen ships to be secretly hired from

      the Easterlings, he delivered this small squadron to Edward, who,

      receiving also a sum of money from the duke, immediately set sail for

      England. No sooner was Charles informed of his departure than he issued a

      proclamation inhibiting all his subjects from giving him countenance or

      assistance;[*] an artifice which could not deceive the earl of Warwick,

      but which might serve as a decent pretence, if that nobleman were so

      disposed, for maintaining friendship with the duke of Burgundy.

     

      Edward, impatient to take revenge on his enemies, and to recover his lost

      authority, made an attempt to land with his forces, which exceeded not two

      thousand men, on the coast of Norfolk; but being there repulsed, he sailed

      northwards, and disembarked at Ravenspur, in Yorkshire. Finding that the

      new magistrates, who had been appointed by the earl of Warwick, kept the

      people every where from joining him, he pretended, and even made oath,

      that he came not to challenge the crown, but only the inheritance of the

      house of York, which of right belonged to him; and that he did not intend

      to disturb the peace of the kingdom. His partisans every moment flocked to

      his standard: he was admitted into the city of York: and he was soon in

      such a situation as gave him hopes of succeeding in all his claims and

      pretensions. The marquis of Montague commanded in the northern counties;

      but from some mysterious reasons, which, as well as many other important

      transactions in that age, no historian has cleared up, he totally

      neglected the beginnings of an insurrection which he ought to have

      esteemed so formidable. Warwick assembled an army at Leicester, with an

      intention of meeting and of giving battle to the enemy; but Edward, by

      taking another road, passed him unmolested, and presented himself before

      the gates of London. Had he here been refused admittance, he was totally

      undone: but there were many reasons which inclined the citizens to favor

      him. His numerous friends, issuing from their sanctuaries, were active in

      his cause; many rich merchants, who had formerly lent him money, saw no

      other chance for their payment but his restoration; the city dames who had

      been liberal of their favors to him, and who still retained an affection

      for this young and gallant prince, swayed their husbands and friends in

      his favor;[**] and above all, the archbishop of York, Warwick’s brother,

      to whom the care of the city was committed, had secretly, from unknown

      reasons, entered into a correspondence with him; and he facilitated

      Edward’s admission into London.

     

      The most likely cause which can be assigned for those multiplied

      infidelities, even in the family of Nevil itself, is the spirit of

      faction, which, when it becomes inveterate, it is very difficult for any

      man entirely to shake off. The persons who had long distinguished

      themselves in the York party, were unable to act with zeal and cordiality

      for the support of the Lancastrians; and they were inclined, by any

      prospect of favor or accommodation offered them by Edward, to return to

      their ancient connections. However this may be, Edward’s entrance into

      London made him master not only of that rich and powerful city, but also

      of the person of Henry, who, destined to be the perpetual sport of

      fortune, thus fell again into the hands of his enemies.[*]

     

      It appears not that Warwick, during his short administration, which had

      continued only six months, had been guilty of any unpopular act, or had

      anywise deserved to lose that general favor with which he had so lately

      overwhelmed Edward. But this prince, who was formerly on the defensive,

      was now the aggressor; and having overcome the difficulties which always

      attend the beginnings of an insurrection, possessed many advantages above

      his enemy: his partisans were actuated by that zeal and courage which the

      notion of an attack inspires his opponents were intimidated for a like

      reason; every one who had been disappointed in the hopes which he had

      entertained from Warwick’s elevation, either became a cool friend or an

      open enemy to that nobleman; and each malecontent, from whatever cause,

      proved an accession to Edward’s army. The king, therefore, found himself

      in a condition to face the earl of Warwick; who, being reÃ«nforced by his

      son-in-law the duke of Clarence, and his brother the marquis of Montague,

      took post at Barnet, in the neighborhood of London. The arrival of Queen

      Margaret was every day expected, who would have drawn together all the

      genuine Lancastrians, and have brought a great accession to Warwick’s

      forces: but this very consideration proved a motive to the earl rather to

      hurry on a decisive action than to share the victory with rivals and

      ancient enemies, who, he foresaw, would, in case of success, claim the

      chief merit in the enterprise.[**]

     

      But while his jealousy was always directed towards that side, he

      overlooked the dangerous infidelity of friends, who lay the nearest to his

      bosom. His brother Montague, who had lately temporized, seems now to have

      remained sincerely attached to the interests of his family: but his

      son-in-law, though bound to him by every tie of honor and gratitude,

      though he shared the power of the regency, though he had been invested by

      Warwick in all the honors and patrimony of the house of York, resolved to

      fulfil the secret engagements which he had formerly taken with his

      brother, and to support the interests of his own family: he deserted to

      the king in the night-time, and carried over a body of twelve thousand men

      along with him.[*] Warwick was now too far advanced to retreat; and as he

      rejected with disdain all terms of peace offered him by Edward and

      Clarence, he was obliged to hazard a general engagement. The battle was

      fought with obstinacy on both sides: the two armies, in imitation of their

      leaders displayed uncommon valor; and the victory remained long undecided

      between them. But an accident threw the balance to the side of the

      Yorkists. Edward’s cognizance was a sun; that of Warwick a star with rays;

      and the mistiness of the morning rendering it difficult to distinguish

      them, the earl of Oxford, who fought on the side of the Lancastrians, was

      by mistake attacked by his friends, and chased off the field of

      battle.[**] Warwick, contrary to his more usual practice, engaged that day

      on foot, resolving to show his army that he meant to share every fortune

      with them; and he was slain in the thickest of the engagement;[***] his

      brother underwent the same fate; and as Edward had issued orders not to

      give any quarter, a great and undistinguished slaughter was made in the

      pursuit. There fell about one thousand five hundred on the side of the

      victors.

     

      The same day on which this decisive battle was fought,[****] Queen

      Margaret and her son, now about eighteen years of age, and a young prince

      of great hopes, landed at Weymouth, supported by a small body of French

      forces.

     

      When this princess received intelligence of her husband’s captivity, and

      of the defeat and death of the earl of Warwick, her courage which had

      supported her under so many disastrous events, here quite left her; and

      she immediately foresaw all the dismal consequences of this calamity. At

      first she took sanctuary in the abbey of Beaulieu;[*] but being encouraged

      by the appearance of Tudor, earl of Pembroke, and Courtney, earl of

      Devonshire, of the Lords Wenlock and St. John, with other men of rank, who

      exhorted her still to hope for success, she resumed her former spirit, and

      determined to defend to the utmost the ruins of her fallen fortunes. She

      advanced through the counties of Devon, Somerset, and Glocester,

      increasing her army on each day’s march; but was at last overtaken by the

      rapid and expeditious Edward, at Tewkesbury, on the banks of the Severn.

      The Lancastrians were here totally defeated: the earl of Devonshire and

      Lord Wenlock were killed in the field: the duke of Somerset, and about

      twenty other persons of distinction, having taken shelter in a church,

      were surrounded, dragged out, and immediately beheaded: about three

      thousand of their side fell in battle: and the army was entirely

      dispersed.

     

      Queen Margaret and her son were taken prisoners, and brought to the king,

      who asked the prince, after an insulting manner, how he dared to invade

      his dominions. The young prince, more mindful of his high birth than of

      his present fortune, replied, that he came thither to claim his just

      inheritance. The ungenerous Edward, insensible to pity, struck him on the

      face with his gauntlet; and the dukes of Clarence and Glocester, Lord

      Hastings, and Sir Thomas Gray, taking the blow as a signal for further

      violence, hurried the prince into the next apartment, and there despatched

      him with their daggers.[**] Margaret was thrown into the Tower: King Henry

      expired in that confinement a few days after the battle of Tewkesbury; but

      whether he died a natural or violent death is uncertain. It is pretended,

      and was generally believed, that the duke of Glocester killed him with his

      own hands:[***] but the universal odium which that prince had incurred,

      inclined perhaps the nation to aggravate his crimes without any sufficient

      authority.

     

      It is certain, however, that Henry’s death was sudden; and though he

      labored under an ill state of health, this circumstance, joined to the

      general manners of the age, gave a natural ground, of suspicion; which was

      rather increased than diminished by the exposing of his body to public

      view. That precaution served only to recall many similar instances in the

      English history, and to suggest the comparison.

     

      All the hopes of the house of Lancaster seemed now to be utterly

      extinguished. Every legitimate prince of that family was dead: almost

      every great leader of the party had perished in battle or on the scaffold:

      the earl of Pembroke, who was levying forces in Wales, disbanded his army

      when he received intelligence of the battle of Tewkesbury; and he fled

      into Brittany with his nephew, the young earl of Richmond.[*] The bastard

      of Falconberg, who had levied some forces, and had advanced to London

      during Edward’s absence, was repulsed; his men deserted him; he was taken

      prisoner and immediately executed:[**] and peace being now fully restored

      to the nation, a parliament was summoned, which ratified as usual, all the

      acts of the victor, and recognized his legal authority.

     

      But this prince, who had been so firm, and active, and intrepid during the

      course of adversity, was still unable to resist the allurements of a

      prosperous fortune; and he wholly devoted himself, as before, to pleasure

      and amusement, after he became entirely master of his kingdom, and had no

      longer any enemy who could give him anxiety or alarm. He recovered,

      however, by this gay and inoffensive course of life, and by his easy,

      familiar manners, that popularity which, it is natural to imagine, he had

      lost by the repeated cruelties exercised upon his enemies; and the example

      also of his jovial festivity served to abate the former acrimony of

      faction among his subjects, and to restore the social disposition which

      had been so long interrupted between the opposite parties. All men seemed

      to be fully satisfied with the present government; and the memory of past

      calamities served only to impress the people more strongly with a sense of

      their allegiance, and with the resolution of never incurring any more the

      hazard of renewing such direful scenes.

     

      1474.

     

      But while the king was thus indulging himself in pleasure, he was roused

      from his lethargy by a prospect of foreign conquests, which, it is

      probable, his desire of popularity, more than the spirit of ambition, had

      made him covet. Though he deemed himself little beholden to the duke of

      Burgundy for the reception which that prince had given him during his

      exile,[*] the political interests of their states maintained still a close

      connection between them; and they agreed to unite their arms in making a

      powerful invasion on France. A league was formed, in which Edward

      stipulated to pass the seas with an army exceeding ten thousand men, and

      to invade the French territories: Charles promised to join him with all

      his forces: the king was to challenge the crown of France, and to obtain

      at least the provinces of Normandy and Guienne; the duke was to acquire

      Champaigne and some other territories, and to free all his dominions from

      the burden of homage to the crown of France: and neither party was to make

      peace without the consent of the other.[**] They were the more encouraged

      to hope for success from this league, as the count of St. Pol, constable

      of France, who was master of St. Quintin and other towns on the Somme, had

      secretly promised to join them; and there were also hopes of engaging the

      duke of Brittany to enter into the confederacy.

     

      The prospect of a French war was always a sure means of making the

      parliament open their purses, as far as the habits of that age would

      permit. They voted the king a tenth of rents, or two shillings in the

      pound; which must have been very inaccurately levied, since it produced

      only thirty-one thousand four hundred and sixty pounds; and they added to

      this supply a whole fifteenth, and three quarters of another;[***] but as

      the king deemed these sums still unequal to the undertaking, he attempted

      to levy money by way of benevolence, a kind of exaction which, except

      during the reigns of Henry III. and Richard II., had not been much practised

      in former times, and which, though the consent of the parties was

      pretended to be gained, could not be deemed entirely voluntary.[****]

     

      The clauses annexed to the parliamentary grant show sufficiently the

      spirit of the nation in this respect. The money levied by the fifteenth

      was not to be put into the king’s hands but to be kept in religious

      houses; and if the expedition into France should not take place, it was

      immediately to be refunded to the people. After these grants, the

      parliament was dissolved, which had sitten near two years and a half, and

      had undergone several prorogations; a practice not very usual at that time

      in England.

     

      1475.

     

      The king passed over to Calais with an army of one thousand five hundred

      men at arms and fifteen thousand archers, attended by all the chief

      nobility of England, who, prognosticating future successes from the past,

      were eager to appear on this great theatre of honor.[*] But all their

      sanguine hopes were damped when they found, on entering the French

      territories, that neither did the constable open his gates to them, nor

      the duke of Burgundy bring them the smallest assistance. That prince,

      transported by his ardent temper, had carried all his armies to a great

      distance, and had employed them in wars on the frontiers of Germany, and

      against the duke of Lorraine: and though he came in person to Edward, and

      endeavored to apologize for this breach of treaty, there was no prospect

      that they would be able this campaign to make a conjunction with the

      English. This circumstance gave great disgust to the king, and inclined

      him to hearken to those advances which Lewis continually made him for an

      accommodation.

     

      That monarch, more swayed by political views than by the point of honor,

      deemed no submissions too mean which might free him from enemies who had

      proved so formidable to his predecessors, and who, united to so many other

      enemies, might still shake the well-established government of France. It

      appears from Comines, that discipline was at this time very imperfect

      among the English; and that their civil wars, though long continued, yet,

      being always decided by hasty battles, had still left them ignorant of the

      improvements which the military art was beginning to receive upon the

      continent.[**]

     

      But as Lewis was sensible that the warlike genius of the people would soon

      render them excellent soldiers, he was far from despising them for their

      present want of experience; and he employed all his art to detach them

      from the alliance of Burgundy. When Edward sent him a herald to claim the

      crown of France, and to carry him a defiance in case of refusal, so far

      from answering to [*] this bravado in like haughty terms, he replied with

      great temper, and even made the herald a considerable present:[**] he took

      afterwards an opportunity of sending a herald to the English camp; and

      having given him directions to apply to the Lords Stanley and Howard, who,

      he heard, were friends to peace, he desired the good offices of these

      noblemen in promoting an accommodation with their master.[***] As Edward

      was now fallen into like dispositions, a truce was soon concluded on terms

      more advantageous than honorable to Lewis. He stipulated to pay Edward

      immediately seventy-five thousand crowns, on condition that he should

      withdraw his army from France, and promised to pay him fifty thousand

      crowns a year during their joint lives: it was added, that the dauphin,

      when of age, should marry Edward’s eldest daughter.[****] In order to

      ratify this treaty, the two monarchs agreed to have a personal interview;

      and for that purpose suitable preparations were made at Pecquigni, near

      Amiens. A close rail was drawn across a bridge in that place, with no

      larger intervals than would allow the arm to pass; a precaution against a

      similar accident to that which befell the duke of Burgundy in his

      conference with the dauphin at Montereau. Edward and Lewis came to the

      opposite sides; conferred privately together; and having confirmed their

      friendship, and interchanged many mutual civilities, they soon after

      parted.[*****]

     

      Lewis was anxious not only to gain the king’s friendship but also that of

      the nation, and of all the considerable persons in the English court. He

      bestowed pensions, to the amount of sixteen thousand crowns a year, on

      several of the kings, favorites; on Lord Hastings two thousand crowns; on

      Lora Howard and others in proportion; and these great ministers were not

      ashamed thus to receive wages from a foreign prince. As the two armies,

      after the conclusion of the truce remained some time in the neighborhood

      of each other, the English were not only admitted freely into Amiens,

      where Lewis resided, but had also their charges defrayed, and had wine and

      victuals furnished them in every inn, without any payment being demanded.

      They flocked thither in such multitude that once above nine thousand of

      them were in the town, and they might have made themselves masters of the

      king’s person; but Lewis, concluding from their jovial and dissolute

      manner of living, that they had no bad intentions, was careful not to

      betray the least sign of fear or jealousy. And when Edward, informed of

      this disorder, desired him to shut the gates against them, he replied,

      that he would never agree to exclude the English from the place where he

      resided; but that Edward, if he pleased, might recall them, and place his

      own officers at the gates of Amiens to prevent their returning.[*]

     

      Lewis’s desire of confirming a mutual amity with England, engaged him even

      to make imprudent advances, which it cost him afterwards some pains to

      evade. In the conference at Pecquigni he had said to Edward, that he

      wished to have a visit from him at Paris; that he would there endeavor to

      amuse him with the ladies; and that, in case any offences were then

      committed, he would assign him the cardinal of Bourbon for confessor, who,

      from fellow-feeling, would not be over and above severe in the penances

      which he would enjoin. This hint made deeper impression than Lewis

      intended. Lord Howard, who accompanied him back to Amiens, told him in

      confidence that, if he were so disposed it would not be impossible to

      persuade Edward to take a journey with him to Paris, where they might make

      merry together. Lewis pretended at first not to hear the offer; but on

      Howard’s repeating it, he expressed his concern that his wars with the

      duke of Burgundy would not permit him to attend his royal guest, and do

      him the honors he intended “Edward,” said he privately to Comines, “is a

      very handsome and a very amorous prince: some lady at Paris may like him

      as well as he shall do her; and may invite him to return in another

      manner. It is better that the sea be between us.”[**]

     

      This treaty did very little honor to either of these monarchs: it

      discovered the imprudence of Edward, who had taken his measures so ill

      with his allies, as to be obliged, after such an expensive armament, to

      return without making any acquisitions adequate to it: it showed the want

      of dignity in Lewis who, rather than run the hazard of a battle, agreed to

      subject his kingdom to a tribute, and thus acknowledge the superiority of

      a neighboring prince possessed of less power and territory than himself.

      But as Lewis made interest the sole test of honor, he thought that all the

      advantages of the treaty were on his side, and that he had overreached

      Edward, by sending him out of France on such easy terms. For this reason

      he was very solicitous to conceal his triumph; and he strictly enjoined

      his courtiers never to show the English the least sign of mockery or

      derision. But he did not himself very carefully observe so prudent a rule:

      he could not forbear, one day, in the joy of his heart, throwing out some

      raillery on the easy simplicity of Edward and his council; when he

      perceived that he was overheard by a Gascon, who had settled in England.

      He was immediately sensible of his indiscretion; sent a message to the

      gentleman; and offered him some advantages in his own country, as engaged

      him to remain in France. “It is but just,” said he, “that I pay the

      penalty of my talkativeness.”[*]

     

      The most honorable part of Lewis’s treaty with Edward was the stipulation

      for the liberty of Queen Margaret, who, though after the death of her

      husband and son she could no longer be formidable to government, was still

      detained in custody by Edward. Lewis paid fifty thousand crowns for her

      ransom; and that princess, who had been so active on the stage of the

      world, and who had experienced such a variety of fortune, passed the

      remainder of her days in tranquility and privacy, till the year 1482, when

      she died; an admirable princess, but more illustrious by her undaunted

      spirit in adversity, than by her moderation in prosperity. She seems

      neither to have enjoyed the virtues, nor been subject to the weaknesses,

      of her sex; and was as much tainted with the ferocity as endowed with the

      courage of that barbarous age in which she lived.

     

      Though Edward had so little reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the

      duke of Burgundy, he reserved to that prince a power of acceding to the

      treaty of Pecquigni: but Charles, when the offer was made him, haughtily

      replied, that he was able to support himself without the assistance of

      England, and that he would make no peace with Lewis till three months

      after Edward’s return into his own country. This prince possessed all the

      ambition and courage of a conqueror; but being defective in policy and

      prudence, qualities no less essential, he was unfortunate in all his

      enterprises; and perished at last in battle against the Swiss;[*] a people

      whom he despised, and who, though brave and free, had hitherto been in a

      manner overlooked in the general system of Europe. This event, which

      happened in the year 1477, produced a great alteration in the views of all

      the princes, and was attended with consequences which were felt for many

      generations. Charles left only one daughter, Mary, by his first wife; and

      this princess, being heir of his opulent and extensive dominions, was

      courted by all the potentates of Christendom, who contended for the

      possession of so rich a prize. Lewis, the head of her family, might, by a

      proper application, have obtained this match for the dauphin, and have

      thereby united to the crown of France all the provinces of the Low

      Countries, together with Burgundy, Artois, and Picardy; which would at

      once have rendered his kingdom an overmate for all its neighbors. But a

      man wholly interested is as rare as one entirely endowed with the opposite

      quality; and Lewis, though impregnable to all the sentiments of generosity

      and friendship, was, on this occasion, carried from the road of true

      policy by the passions of animosity and revenge. He had imbibed so deep a

      hatred to the house of Burgundy, that he rather chose to subdue the

      princess by arms, than unite her to his family by marriage: he conquered

      the duchy of Burgundy and that part of Picardy which had been ceded to

      Philip the Good by the treaty of Arras: but he thereby forced the states

      of the Netherlands to bestow their sovereign in marriage on Maximilian of

      Austria, son of the emperor Frederick, from whom they looked for

      protection in their present distresses: and by these means, France lost

      the opportunity, which she never could recall, of making that important

      acquisition of power and territory.

     

      During this interesting crisis, Edward was no less defective in policy,

      and was no less actuated by private passions, unworthy of a sovereign and

      a statesman. Jealousy of his brother Clarence had caused him to neglect

      the advances which were made of marrying that prince, now a widower, to

      the heiress of Burgundy;[**] and he sent her proposals of espousing

      Anthony, earl of Rivers, brother to his queen, who still retained an

      entire ascendant over him.

     

      But the match was rejected with disdain;[*] and Edward, resenting this

      treatment of his brother-in-law, permitted France to proceed without

      interruption in her conquests over his defenceless ally. Any pretence

      sufficed him for abandoning himself entirely to indolence and pleasure,

      which were now become his ruling passions. The only object which divided

      his attention was the improving of the public revenue, which had been

      dilapidated by the necessities or negligence of his predecessors; and some

      of his expedients for that purpose, though unknown to us, were deemed,

      during the time, oppressive to the people.[**] The detail of private

      wrongs naturally escapes the notice of history; but an act of tyranny of

      which Edward was guilty in his own family, has been taken notice of by all

      writers, and has met with general and deserved censure.

     

      The duke of Clarence, by all his services in deserting Warwick, had never

      been able to regain the king’s friendship, which he had forfeited by his

      former confederacy with that nobleman. He was still regarded at court as a

      man of a dangerous and a fickle character; and the imprudent openness and

      violence of his temper, though it rendered him much less dangerous, tended

      extremely to multiply his enemies, and to incense them against him. Among

      others, he had had the misfortune to give displeasure to the queen

      herself, as well as to his brother, the duke of Glocester, a prince of the

      deepest policy, of the most unrelenting ambition, and the least scrupulous

      in the means which he employed for the attainment or his ends. A

      combination between these potent adversaries being secretly formed against

      Clarence, it was determined to begin by attacking his friends; in hopes

      that, if he patiently endured this injury, his pusillanimity would

      dishonor him in the eyes of the public; if he made resistance, and

      expressed resentment, his passion would betray him into measures which

      might give them advantages against him. The king, hunting one day in the

      park of Thomas Burdet, of Arrow, in Warwickshire, had killed a white buck,

      which was a great favorite of the owner; and Burdet, vexed at the loss,

      broke into a passion, and wished the horns of the deer in the belly of the

      person who had advised the king to commit that insult upon him. This

      natural expression of resentment, which would have been overlooked or

      forgotten had it fallen from any other person, was rendered criminal and

      capital in that gentleman, by the friendship in which he had the

      misfortune to live with the duke of Clarence; he was tried for his life;

      the judges and jury were found servile enough to condemn him and he was

      publicly beheaded at Tyburn for this pretended offence.[*] About the same

      time, one John Stacey, an ecclesiastic, much connected with the duke as

      well as with Burdet, was exposed to a like iniquitous and barbarous

      prosecution. This clergyman, being more learned in mathematics and

      astronomy than was usual in that age, lay under the imputation of

      necromancy with the ignorant vulgar; and the court laid hold of this

      popular rumor to effect his destruction. He was brought to his trial for

      that imaginary crime; many of the greatest peers countenanced the

      prosecution by their presence; he was condemned, put to the torture, and

      executed.[**]

     

      The duke of Clarence was alarmed when he found these acts of tyranny

      exercised on all around him: he reflected on the fate of the good duke of

      Glocester, in the last reign, who, after seeing the most infamous

      pretences employed for the destruction of his nearest connections, at last

      fell himself a victim to the vengeance of his enemies. But Clarence,

      instead of securing his own life against the present danger by silence and

      reserve, was open and loud in justifying the innocence of his friends, and

      in exclaiming against the iniquity of their prosecutors.

     

      1478.

     

      The king, highly offended with his freedom, or using that pretence against

      him, committed him to the Tower,[***] summoned a parliament, and tried him

      for his life before the house of peers, the supreme tribunal of the

      nation.

     

      The duke was accused of arraigning public justice, by maintaining the

      innocence of men who had been condemned in courts of judicature, and or

      inveighing against the iniquity of the king, who had given orders for

      their prosecution.[****]

     

      Many rash expressions were imputed to him, and some, too, reflecting on

      Edward’s legitimacy; but he was not accused of any overt act of treason;

      and even the truth of these speeches may be doubted of, since the liberty

      of judgment was taken from the court, by the king’s appearing personally

      as his brother’s accuser,[*] and pleading the cause against him. But a

      sentence of condemnation, even when this extraordinary circumstance had

      not place, was a necessary consequence, in those times, of any prosecution

      by the court or the prevailing party; and the duke of Clarence was

      pronounced guilty by the peers. The house of commons were no less slavish

      and unjust: they both petitioned for the execution of the duke, and

      afterwards passed a bill of attainder against him.[**] The measures of the

      parliament, during that age, furnish us with examples of a strange

      contrast of freedom and servility: they scruple to grant, and sometimes

      refuse, to the king the smallest supplies, the most necessary for the

      support of government, even the most necessary for the maintenance of

      wars, for which the nation, as well as the parliament itself, expressed

      great fondness: but they never scruple to concur in the most flagrant act

      of injustice or tyranny which falls on any individual, however

      distinguished by birth or merit. These maxims, so ungenerous, so opposite

      to all principles of good government, so contrary to the practice of

      present parliaments, are very remarkable in all the transactions of the

      English history for more than a century after the period in which we are

      now engaged.

     

      The only favor which the king granted his brother after his condemnation,

      was to leave him the choice of his death; and he was privately drowned in

      a butt of malmsey in the Tower; a whimsical choice, which implies that he

      had an extraordinary passion for that liquor. The duke left two children

      by the elder daughter of the earl of Warwick; a son, created an earl by

      his grandfather’s title, and a daughter, afterwards countess of Salisbury.

      Both this prince and princess were also unfortunate in their end, and died

      a violent death; a fate which, for many years, attended almost all the

      descendants of the royal blood in England. There prevails a report, that a

      chief source of the violent prosecution of the duke of Clarence, whose

      name was George, was a current prophecy, that the king’s son should be

      murdered by one, the initial letter of whose name was G.[***] It is not

      impossible but, in those ignorant times, such a silly reason might have

      some influence; but it is more probable that the whole story is the

      invention of a subsequent period, and founded on the murder of these

      children by the duke of Glocester. Comines remarks, that at that time the

      English never were without some superstitious prophecy or other, by which

      they accounted for every event.

     

      All the glories of Edward’s reign terminated with the civil wars, where

      his laurels, too, were extremely sullied with blood, violence, and

      cruelty. His spirit seems afterwards to have been sunk in indolence and

      pleasure, or his measures were frustrated by imprudence and the want of

      foresight. There was no object on which he was more intent than to have

      all his daughters settled by splendid marriages, though most of these

      princesses were yet in their infancy, and though the completion of his

      views, it was obvious, must depend on numberless accidents, which were

      impossible to be foreseen or prevented. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth,

      was contracted to the dauphin; his second, Cicely, to the eldest son of

      James III., king of Scotland; his third, Anne, to Philip, only son of

      Maximilian and the duchess of Burgundy; his fourth, Catharine, to John,

      son and heir to Ferdinand, king of Arragon, and Isabella, queen of

      Castile.[*] None of these projected marriages took place; and the king

      himself saw in his lifetime the rupture of the first, that with the

      dauphin, for which he had always discovered a peculiar fondness. Lewis,

      who paid no regard to treaties or engagements, found his advantage in

      contracting the dauphin to the princess Margaret, daughter of Maximilian,

      and the king, notwithstanding his indolence, prepared to revenge the

      indignity.

     

      1482.

     

      The French monarch, eminent for prudence as well as perfidy, endeavored to

      guard against the blow; and by a proper distribution of presents in the

      court of Scotland, he incited James to make war upon England. This prince,

      who lived on bad terms with his own nobility, and whose force was very

      unequal to the enterprise, levied an army; but when he was ready to enter

      England, the barons, conspiring against his favorites, put them to death

      without trial; and the army presently disbanded. The duke of Glocester,

      attended by the duke of Albany, James’s brother, who had been banished his

      country, entered Scotland at the head of an army, took Berwick, and

      obliged the Scots to accept of a peace, by which they resigned that

      fortress to Edward. This success imboldened the king to think more

      seriously of a French war; but while he was making preparations for that

      enterprise, he was seized with a distemper, of which he expired in the

      forty-second year of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign; a prince

      more splendid and showy than either prudent or virtuous; brave, though

      cruel; addicted to pleasure, though capable of activity in great

      emergencies; and less fitted to prevent ills by wise precautions, than to

      remedy them, after they took place, by his vigor and enterprise. Besides

      five daughters, this king left two sons; Edward, prince of Wales, his

      successor, then in his thirteenth year and Richard, duke of York, in his

      ninth
