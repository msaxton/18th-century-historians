There is no abuse so great in civil society, as not to be attended with a

variety of beneficial consequence; and in the beginnings of reformation,

the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly, while the

benefit, resulting from the change is the slow effect of time, and is

seldom perceived by the bulk of a nation. Scarce any institution can be

imagined less favorable, in the main, to the interests of mankind than

that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many good effects, which,

having ceased by the suppression of monasteries, were much regretted by

the people of England. The monks, always residing in their convents, in

the centre of their estates, spent their money in the provinces and among

their tenants, afforded a ready market for commodities, were a sure

resource to the poor and indigent; and though their hospitality and

charity gave but too much encouragement to idleness, and prevented the

increase of public riches, yet did it provide to many a relief from the

extreme pressures of want and necessity. It is also observable, that as

the friars were limited by the rules of their institution to a certain

mode of living, they had not equal motives for extortion with other men,

and they were acknowledged to have been in England, as they still are in

Roman Catholic countries, the best and most indulgent landlords. The

abbots and priors were permitted to give leases at an under-value, and to

receive in return a large present from the tenant, in the same manner as

is still practised by the bishops and colleges. But when the abbey lands

were distributed among the principal nobility and courtiers, they fell

under a different management: the rents of farms were raised, while the

tenants found not the same facility in disposing of the produce; the money

was often spent in the capital, and the farmers, living at a distance,

were exposed to oppression from their new masters, or to the still greater

rapacity of the stewards.

 

These grievances of the common people were at that time heightened by

other causes. The arts of manufacture were much more advanced in other

European countries than in England; and even in England these arts had

made greater progress than the knowledge of agriculture; a profession

which of all mechanical employments, requires the most reflection and

experience. A great demand arose for wool both abroad and at home:

pasturage was found more profitable than unskilful tillage: whole estates

were laid waste by enclosures; the tenants, regarded as a useless burden,

were expelled their habitations; even the cottagers, deprived of the

commons on which they formerly fed their cattle, were reduced to misery;

and a decay of people, as well as a diminution of the former plenty, was

remarked in the kingdom.[*] This grievance was now of an old date, and Sir

Thomas More, alluding to it, observes in his Utopia, that a sheep had

become in England a more ravenous animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured

whole villages, cities, and provinces.

 

The general increase, also, of gold and silver in Europe, after the

discovery of the West Indies, had a tendency to inflame these complaints.

The growing demand in the more commercial countries had heightened every

where the price of commodities, which could easily be transported thither;

but in England, the labor of men, who could not so easily change their

habitation, still remained nearly at the ancient rates, and the poor

complained that they could no longer gain a subsistence by their industry.

It was by an addition alone of toil and application they were enabled to

procure a maintenance; and though this increase of industry was at last

the effect of the present situation, and an effect beneficial to society,

yet was it difficult for the people to shake off their former habits of

indolence; and nothing but necessity could compel them to such an exertion

of their faculties.

 

It must also be remarked, that the profusion of Henry VIII. had reduced

him, notwithstanding his rapacity, to such difficulties, that he had been

obliged to remedy a present necessity by the pernicious expedient of

debasing the coin; and the wars in which the protector had been involved,

had induced him to carry still further the same abuse. The usual

consequences ensued: the good specie was hoarded or exported; base metal

was coined at home, or imported from abroad in great abundance; the common

people, who received their wages in it, could not purchase commodities at

the usual rates: a universal diffidence and stagnation of commerce took

place; and loud complaints were heard in every part of England.

 

The protector, who loved popularity, and pitied the condition of the

people, encouraged these complaints by his endeavors to redress them. He

appointed a commission for making inquiry concerning enclosures; and

issued a proclamation, ordering all late enclosures to be laid open by a

day appointed. The populace, meeting with such countenance from

government, began to rise in several places, and to commit disorders; but

were quieted by remonstrances and persuasion. In order to give them

greater satisfaction, Somerset appointed new commissioners, whom he sent

every where, with an unlimited power to hear and determine all causes

about enclosures, highways, and cottages.[*] As this commission was

disagreeable to the gentry and nobility, they stigmatized it as arbitrary

and illegal; and the common people, fearing it would be eluded, and being

impatient for immediate redress, could no longer contain their fury, but

sought for a remedy by force of arms. The rising began at once in several

parts of England, as if a universal conspiracy had been formed by the

commonalty. The rebels in Wiltshire were dispersed by Sir William Herbert:

those in’ the neighboring counties, Oxford and Glocester, by Lord Gray, of

Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed in the field: others were executed

by martial law. The commotions in Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, and other

counties, were quieted by gentler expedients; but the disorders in

Devonshire and Norfolk threatened more dangerous consequences.

 

The commonalty in Devonshire began with the usual complaints against

enclosures and against oppressions from the gentry; but the parish priest

of Sampford Courtenay had the address to give their discontent a direction

towards religion; and the delicacy of the subject, in the present

emergency, made the insurrection immediately appear formidable. In other

counties, the gentry had kept closely united with government; but here

many of them took part with the populace among others, Humphrey Arundel,

governor of St. Michael’s Mount. The rioters were brought into the form of

a regular army, which amounted to the number of ten thousand. Lord Russel

had been sent against them at the head of a small force; but finding

himself too weak to encounter them in the field, he kept at a distance,

and began to negotiate with them; in hopes of eluding their fury by delay,

and of dispersing them by the difficulty of their subsisting in a body.

Their demands were, that the mass should be restored, half of the abbey

lands resumed, the law of the six articles executed, holy water and holy

bread respected, and all other particular grievances redressed.[*] The

council, to whom Russet transmitted these demands, sent a haughty answer;

commanded the rebels to disperse, and promised them pardon upon their

immediate submission. Enraged at this disappointment, they marched to

Exeter, carrying before them crosses, banners, holy water, candlesticks,

and other implements of ancient superstition; together with the host,

which they covered with a canopy.[**] The citizens of Exeter shut their

gates; and the rebels, as they had no cannon, endeavored to take the

place, first by scalade, then by mining; but were repulsed in every

attempt. Russel meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reÃ«nforced by Sir William

Herbert and Lord Gray with some German horse, and some Italian

arquebusiers under Battista Spinola. He then resolved to attempt the

relief of Exeter, which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the

rebels, drove them from all their posts, did great execution upon them,

both in the action and pursuit,[***] and took many prisoners. Arundel and

the other leaders were sent to London, tried, and executed. Many of the

inferior sort were put to death by martial law:[****] the vicar of St.

Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his

own steeple, arrayed in his Popish weeds, with his beads at his girdle.[v]

 

The insurrection in Norfolk rose to a still greater height, and was

attended with greater acts of violence. The populace were at first

excited, as in other places, by complaints against enclosures; but finding

their numbers amount to twenty thousand, they grew insolent, and proceeded

to more exorbitant pretensions. They required the suppression of the

gentry, the placing of new counsellors about the king, and the

reÃ«stablishment of the ancient rites. One Ket, a tanner, had assumed the

government over them; and he exercised his authority with the utmost

arrogance and outrage. Having taken possession of Moushold Hill near

Norwich, he erected his tribunal under an old oak, thence called the oak

of reformation; and summoning the gentry to appear before him, he gave

such decrees as might be expected from his character and situation. The

marquis of Northampton was first ordered against him; but met with a

repulse in an action, where Lord Sheffield was killed.[*] The protector

affected popularity, and cared not to appear in person against the rebels;

he therefore sent the earl of Warwick at the head of six thousand men,

levied for the wars against Scotland; and he thereby afforded his mortal

enemy an opportunity of increasing his reputation and character. Warwick,

having tried some skirmishes with the rebels, at last made a general

attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thousand fell in the action

and pursuit: Ket was hanged at Norwich Castle, nine of his followers on

the boughs of the oak of reformation; and the insurrection was entirely

suppressed. Some rebels in Yorkshire, learning the fate of their

companions, accepted the offers of pardon, and threw down their arms. A

general indemnity was soon after published by the protector.[**]

 

But though the insurrections were thus quickly subdued in England, and no

traces of them seemed to remain, they were attended with bad consequences

to the foreign interests of the nation. The forces of the earl of Warwick,

which might have made a great impression on Scotland, were diverted from

that enterprise; and the French general had leisure to reduce that country

to some settlement and composure. He took the fortress of Broughty, and

put the garrison to the sword. He straitened the English at Haddington;

and though Lord Dacres was enabled to throw relief into the place, and to

reenforce the garrison, it was found at last very chargeable, and even

impracticable, to keep possession of that fortress. The whole country in

the neighborhood was laid waste by the inroads both of the Scots and

English, and could afford no supply to the garrison: the place lay above

thirty miles from the borders; so that a regular army was necessary to

escort any provisions thither: and as the plague had broken out among the

troops, they perished daily, and were reduced to a state of great

weakness. For these reasons, orders were given to dismantle Haddington,

and to convey the artillery and garrison to Berwick; and the earl of

Rutland, now created warden of the east marches, executed the orders.

 

The king of France also took advantage of the distractions among the

English, and made an attempt to recover Boulogne and that territory which

Henry VIII. had conquered from France, On other pretences, he assembled an

army, and falling suddenly upon the Boulonnois, took the castles of

Sellaque, Blackness, and Ambleteuse, though well supplied with garrisons,

ammunition, and provisions.[*] He endeavored to surprise Boulenberg, and

was repulsed; but the garrison, not thinking the place tenable after the

loss of the other fortresses, destroyed the works, and retired to

Boulogne. The rains, which fell in great abundance during the autumn, and

a pestilential distemper which broke out in the French camp, deprived

Henry of all hopes of success against Boulogne itself; and he retired to

Paris.[**] He left the command of the army to Gaspar de Coligny, lord of

Chatillon, so famous afterwards by the name of Admiral Coligny; and he

gave him orders to form the siege early in the spring. The active

disposition of this general engaged him to make, during the winter,

several attempts against the place; but they all proved unsuccessful.

 

Strozzi, who commanded the French fleet and galleys, endeavored to make a

descent on Jersey; but meeting there with an English fleet, he commenced

an action, which seems not to have been decisive, since the historians of

the two nations differ in their account of the event.[***]

 

As soon as the French war broke out, the protector endeavored to fortify

himself with the alliance of the emperor; and he sent over Secretary Paget

to Brussels, where Charles then kept court, in order to assist Sir Philip

Hobby, the resident ambassador, in this negotiation. But that prince had

formed a design of extending his dominions by acting the part of champion

for the Catholic religion; and though extremely desirous of accepting the

English alliance against France, his capital enemy, he thought it

unsuitable to his other pretensions to enter into strict confederacy with

a nation which had broken off all connections with the church of Rome. He

therefore declined the advances of friendship from England, and eluded the

applications of the ambassadors. An exact account is preserved of this

negotiation in a letter of Hobby’s; and it is remarkable, that the

emperor, in a conversation with the English ministers, asserted, that the

prerogatives of a king of England were more extensive than those of a king

of France.[*] Burnet, who preserves this letter, subjoins, as a parallel

instance, that one objection which the Scots made to marrying their queen

with Edward was, that all their privileges would be swallowed up by the

great prerogative of the kings of England.[**]

 

Somerset, despairing of assistance from the emperor, was inclined to

conclude a peace with France and Scotland; and besides that he was not in

a condition to maintain such ruinous wars, he thought that there no longer

remained any object of hostility. The Scots had sent away their queen; and

could not, if ever so much inclined, complete the marriage contracted with

Edward; and as Henry VIII. had stipulated to restore Boulogne in 1554, it

seemed a matter of small moment to anticipate a few years the execution of

the treaty. But when he proposed these reasons to the council, he met with

strong opposition from his enemies; who, seeing him unable to support the

war, were determined, for that very reason, to oppose all proposals for a

pacification. The factions ran high in the court of England; and matters

were drawing to an issue fatal to the authority of the protector.

 

After Somerset obtained the patent investing him with regal authority, he

no longer paid any attention to the opinion of the other executors and

counsellors; and being elated with his high dignity, as well as with his

victory at Pinkey, he thought that every one ought, in every thing, to

yield to his sentiments. All those who were not entirely devoted to him

were sure to be neglected; whoever opposed his will received marks of

anger or contempt;[***] and while he showed a resolution to govern every

thing, his capacity appeared not in any respect proportioned to his

ambition. Warwick, more subtle and artful, covered more exorbitant views

under fairer appearances, and having associated himself with Southampton,

who had been readmitted into the council, he formed a strong party who

were determined to free themselves from the slavery imposed on them by the

protector.

 

The malecontent counsellors found the disposition of the nation favorable

to their designs. The nobility and gentry were in general displeased with

the preference which Somerset seemed to have given to the people; and as

they ascribed all the insults to which they had been lately exposed to his

procrastination, and to the countenance shown to the multitude, they

apprehended a renewal of the same disorders from his present affectation

of popularity. He had erected a court of requests in his own house for the

relief of the people,[*] and he interposed with the judges in their

behalf; a measure which might be deemed illegal, if any exertion of

prerogative at that time could with certainty deserve that appellation.

And this attempt, which was a stretch of power, seemed the more impolitic,

because it disgusted the nobles, the surest support of monarchical

authority.

 

But though Somerset courted the people, the interest which he had formed

with them was in no degree answerable to his expectations. The Catholic

party who retained influence with the lower ranks, were his declared

enemies, and took advantage of every opportunity to decry his conduct. The

attainder and execution of his brother bore an odious aspect: the

introduction of foreign troops into the kingdom was represented in

invidious colors: the great estate which he had suddenly acquired at the

expense of the church and of the crown, rendered him obnoxious; and the

palace which he was building in the Strand, served by its magnificence,

and still more by other circumstances which attended it, to expose him to

the censure of the public. The parish church of St. Mary, with three

bishops’ houses, was pulled down, in order to furnish ground and materials

for this structure: not content with that sacrilege, an attempt was made

to demolish St. Margaret’s Westminster, and to employ the stones to the

same purpose but the parishioners rose in a tumult, and chased away the

protector’s tradesmen. He then laid his hands on a chapel in St. Paul’s

churchyard, with a cloister and charnel-house belonging to it; and these

edifices, together with a church of St. John of Jerusalem, were made use

of to raise his palace. What rendered the matter more odious to the people

was, that the tombs and other monuments of the dead wore defaced; and the

bones, being carried away, were buried in unconsecrated ground.[*]

 

All these imprudences were remarked by Somerset’s enemies, who resolved to

take advantage of them. Lord St. John president of the council, the earls

of Warwick, Southampton and Arundel, with five members more, met at Ely

House and, assuming to themselves the whole power of the council, began to

act independently of the protector, whom they represented as the author of

every public grievance and misfortune. They wrote letters to the chief

nobility and gentry in England, informing them of the present measures,

and requiring their assistance: they sent for the mayor and aldermen of

London, and enjoined them to obey their orders, without regard to any

contrary orders which they might receive from the duke of Somerset. They

laid the same injunctions on the lieutenant of the Tower, who expressed

his resolution to comply with them. Next day, Rich, lord chancellor, the

marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir

John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and Chief Justice Montague, joined the

malecontent counsellors; and every thing bore a bad aspect for the

protector’s authority. Secretary Petre, whom he had sent to treat with the

council, rather chose to remain with them: the common council of the city,

being applied to, declared with one voice their approbation of the new

measures, and their resolution of supporting them.[**]

 

As soon as the protector heard of the defection of the counsellors, he

removed the king from Hampton Court, where he then resided, to the Castle

of Windsor; and arming his friends and servants, seemed resolute to defend

himself against all his enemies. But finding that no man of rank, except

Cranmer and Paget, adhered to him, that the people did not rise at his

summons, that the city and Tower had declared against him, that even his

best friends had deserted him, he lost all hopes of success, and began to

apply to his enemies for pardon and forgiveness. No sooner was this

despondency known, than Lord Russell, Sir John Baker, speaker of the house

of commons, and three counsellors more, who had hitherto remained neuters,

joined the party of Warwick, whom every one now regarded as master. The

council informed the public, by proclamation, of their actions and

intentions; they wrote to the princesses Mary and Elizabeth to the same

purpose; and they made addresses to the king, in which, after the humblest

protestations of duty and submission, they informed him that they were the

council appointed by his father for the government of the kingdom during

his minority; that they had chosen the duke of Somerset protector, under

the express condition that he should guide himself by their advice and

direction; that he had usurped the whole authority, and had neglected, and

even in every thing opposed, their counsel; that he had proceeded to that

height of presumption, as to levy forces against them and place these

forces about his majesty’s person: they therefore begged that they might

be admitted to his royal presence, that he would be pleased to restore

them to his confidence, and that Somerset’s servants might be dismissed.

Their request was complied with: Somerset capitulated only for gentle

treatment, which was promised him. He was, however, sent to the Tower,[*]

with some of his friends and partisans, among whom was Cecil, afterwards

so much distinguished. Articles of indictment were exhibited against

him;[**] of which the chief, at least the best founded, is his usurpation

of the government, and his taking into his own hands the whole

administration of affairs. The clause of his patent, which invested him

with absolute power, unlimited by any law, was never objected to him;

plainly because, according to the sentiments of those times, that power

was in some degree involved in the very idea of regal authority.

 

The Catholics were extremely elated with this revolution; and as they had

ascribed all the late innovations to Somerset’s authority, they hoped that

his fall would prepare the way for the return of the ancient religion. But

Warwick, who now bore chief sway in the council, was entirely indifferent

with regard to all these points of controversy; and finding that the

principles of the reformation had sunk deeper into Edward’s mind than to

be easily eradicated, he was determined to comply with the young prince’s

inclinations, and not to hazard his new-acquired power by any dangerous

enterprise. He took care very early to express his intentions of

supporting the reformation; and he threw such discouragements on

Southampton, who stood at the head of the Romanists, and whom he

considered as a dangerous rival, that that high-spirited nobleman retired

from the council, and soon after died from vexation and disappointment.

The other counsellors, who had concurred in the revolution, received their

reward by promotions and new honors. Russel was created earl of Bedford:

the marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great chamberlain; and

Lord Wentworth, besides the office of chamberlain of the household, got

two large manors, Stepney and Hackney, which were torn from the see of

London.[*] A council of regency was formed; not that which Henry’s will

had appointed for the government of the kingdom, and which, being founded

on an act of parliament, was the only legal one, but composed chiefly of

members who had formerly been appointed by Somerset, and who derived their

seat from an authority which was now declared usurped and illegal. But

such niceties were, during that age, little understood, and still less

regarded, in England.

 

A session of parliament was held; and as it was the usual maxim of that

assembly to acquiesce in every administration which was established, the

council dreaded no opposition from that quarter, and had more reason to

look for a corroboration of their authority. Somerset had been prevailed

on to confess, on his knees, before the council, all the articles of

charge against him; and he imputed these misdemeanors to his own rashness,

folly, and indiscretion, not to any malignity of intention.[**] He even

subscribed this confession; and the paper was given in to parliament, who,

after sending a committee to examine him, and hear him acknowledge it to

be genuine, passed a vote, by which they deprived him of all his offices,

and fined him two thousand pounds a year in land. Lord St. John was

created treasurer in his place, and Warwick earl marshal. The prosecution

against him was carried no further. His fine was remitted by the king: he

recovered his liberty: and Warwick, thinking that he was now sufficiently

humbled, and that his authority was much lessened by his late tame and

abject behavior, readmitted him into the council, and even agreed to an

alliance between their families, by the marriage of his own son, Lord

Dudley, with the Lady Jane Seymour, daughter of Somerset.[***]

 

During this session, a severe law was passed against riots.[*] It was

enacted, that if any, to the number of twelve persons, should meet

together for any matter of state, and being required by a lawful

magistrate, should not disperse, it should be treason; and if any broke

hedges, or violently pulled up pales about enclosures, without lawful

authority, it should be felony: any attempt to kill a privy counsellor was

subjected to the same penalty. The bishops had made an application,

complaining that they were deprived of all their power by the

encroachments of the civil courts, and the present suspension of the canon

law; that they could summon no offender before them, punish no vice, or

exert the discipline of the church; from which diminution of their

authority, they pretended, immorality had every where received great

encouragement and increase. The design of some was to revive the

penitentiary rules of the primitive church; but others thought, that such

an authority committed to the bishops would prove more oppressive than

confession, penance, and all the clerical inventions of the Romish

superstition. The parliament, for the present, contented themselves with

empowering the king to appoint thirty-two commissioners to compile a body

of canon laws, which were to be valid, though never ratified by

parliament. Such implicit trust did they repose in the crown, without

reflecting that all their liberties and properties might be affected by

these canons.[**] The king did not live to affix the royal sanction to the

new canons. Sir John Sharington, whose crimes and malversations had

appeared so egregious at the condemnation of Lord Seymour, obtained from

parliament a reversal of his attainder. This man sought favor with the

more zealous reformers; and Bishop Latimer affirmed that, though formerly

he had been a most notorious knave, he was now so penitent that he had

become a very honest man.

 

1550.

 

When Warwick and the council of regency began to exercise their power,

they found themselves involved in the same difficulties that had

embarrassed the protector. The wars with France and Scotland could not be

supported by an exhausted exchequer; seemed dangerous to a divided nation;

and were now acknowledged not to have any object which even the greatest

and most uninterrupted success could attain. The project of peace

entertained by Somerset had served them as a pretence for clamor against

his administration; yet, after sending Sir Thomas Cheney to the emperor,

and making again a fruitless effort to engage him in the protection of

Boulogne, they found themselves obliged to listen to the advances which

Henry made them, by the canal of Guidotti, a Florentine merchant. The earl

of Bedford, Sir John Mason, Paget, and Petre, were sent over to Boulogne,

with full powers to negotiate. The French king absolutely refused to pay

the two millions of crowns, which his predecessor had acknowledged to be

due to the crown of England as arrears of pensions; and said, that he

never would consent to render himself tributary to any prince: but he

offered a sum for the immediate restitution of Boulogne; and four hundred

thousand crowns were at last agreed on, one half to be paid immediately,

the other in August following. Six hostages were given for the performance

of this article. Scotland was comprehended in the treaty: the English

stipulated to restore Lauder and Dunglas, and to demolish the fortresses

of Roxburgh and Eymouth.[*] No sooner was peace concluded with France,

than a project was entertained of a close alliance with that kingdom; and

Henry willingly embraced a proposal so suitable both to his interests and

his inclinations. An agreement some time after was formed for a marriage

between Edward and Elizabeth, a daughter of France; and all the articles

were, after a little negotiation, fully settled:[**] but this project

never took effect.

 

The intention of marrying the king to a daughter of Henry, a violent

persecutor of the Protestants, was nowise acceptable to that party in

England: but in all other respects the council was steady in promoting the

reformation, and in enforcing the laws against the Romanists. Several

prelates were still addicted to that communion; and though they made some

compliances, in order to save their bishoprics, they retarded, as much as

they safely could, the execution of the new laws, and gave countenance to

such incumbents as were negligent or refractory. A resolution was

therefore taken to seek pretences for depriving those prelates; and the

execution of this intention was the more easy, as they had all of them

been obliged to take commissions, in which it was declared, that they held

their sees during the king’s pleasure only. It was thought proper to begin

with Gardiner, in order to strike a terror into the rest. The method of

proceeding against him was violent, and had scarcely any color of law or

justice. Injunctions had been given him to inculcate in a sermon the duty

of obedience to a king, even during his minority; and because he had

neglected this topic, he had been thrown into prison, and had been there

detained during two years, without being accused of any crime except

disobedience to this arbitrary command. The duke of Somerset, Secretary

Petre, and some others of the council, were now sent, in order to try his

temper, and endeavor to find some grounds for depriving him: he professed

to them his intention of conforming to the government, of supporting the

king’s laws, and of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the

disposition which they expected or desired.[*] A new deputation was

therefore sent, who carried him several articles to subscribe. He was

required to acknowledge his former misbehavior, and to confess the justice

of his confinement: he was likewise to own, that the king was supreme head

of the church; that the power of making and dispensing with holydays was

part of the prerogative; that the book of common prayer was a godly and

commendable form; that the king was a complete sovereign in his minority;

that the law of the six articles was justly repealed; and that the king

had full authority to correct and reform what was amiss in ecclesiastical

discipline, government, or doctrine. The bishop was willing to set his

hand to all the articles except the first: he maintained his conduct to

have been inoffensive; and declared, that he would not own himself guilty

of faults which he had never committed.[**]

 

The council, finding that he had gone such lengths, were determined to

prevent his full compliance by multiplying the difficulties upon him, and

sending him new articles to subscribe. A list was selected of such points

as they thought would be the hardest of digestion; and, not content with

this rigor, they also insisted on his submission, and his acknowledgment

of past errors. To make this subscription more mortifying, they demanded a

promise, that he would recommend and publish all these articles from the

pulpit: but Gardiner, who saw that they intended either to ruin or

dishonor him, or perhaps both, determined not to gratify his enemies by

any further compliance: he still maintained his innocence; desired a fair

trial; and refused to subscribe more articles till he should recover his

liberty. For this pretended offence his bishopric was put under

sequestration for three months; and as he then appeared no more compliant

than before, a commission was appointed to try, or, more properly

speaking, to condemn him.

 

1551.

 

The commissioners were, the primate, the bishops of London, Ely, and

Lincoln, Secretary Petre, Sir James Hales, and some other lawyers.

Gardiner objected to the legality of the commission, which was not founded

on any statute or precedent; and he appealed from the commissioners to the

king. His appeal was not regarded: sentence was pronounced against him; he

was deprived of his bishopric, and committed to close custody; his books

and papers were seized; he was secluded from all company; and it was not

allowed him either to send or receive any letters or messages.[*]

 

Gardiner, as well as the other prelates, had agreed to hold his office

during the king’s pleasure: but the council, unwilling to make use of a

concession which had been so illegally and arbitrarily extorted, chose

rather to employ some forms of justice; a resolution which led them to

commit still greater iniquities and severities. But the violence of the

reformers did not stop here. Day, bishop of Chichester, Heathe of

Worcester, and Voisey of Exeter, were deprived of their bishoprics, on

pretence of disobedience. Even Kitchen of Landaff, Capon of Salisbury, and

Samson of Coventry, though they had complied in every thing, yet, not

being supposed cordial in their obedience, were obliged to seek

protection, by sacrificing the most considerable revenues of their see to

the rapacious courtiers.[**]

 

These plunderers neglected not even smaller profits. An order was issued

by council for purging the library at Westminster of all missals, legends,

and other superstitious volumes, and delivering their garniture to Sir

Anthony Aucher.[***]

 

Many of these books were plated with gold and silver, and curiously

embossed; and this finery was probably the superstition that condemned

them. Great havoc was likewise made on the libraries at Oxford. Books and

manuscripts were destroyed without distinction: the volumes of divinity

from the council books, suffered for their rich binding: those of

literature were condemned as useless: those of geometry and astronomy were

supposed to contain nothing but necromancy.[*] The university had not

power to oppose these barbarous violences: they were in danger of losing

their own revenues; and expected every moment to be swallowed up by the

earl of Warwick and his associates.

 

Though every one besides yielded to the authority of the council, the lady

Mary could never be brought to compliance; and she still continued to

adhere to the mass, and to reject the new liturgy. Her behavior was,

during some time, connived at; but at last her two chaplains, Mallet and

Berkeley, were thrown into prison;[**] and remonstrances were made to the

princess herself on account of her disobedience. The council wrote her a

letter, by which they endeavored to make her change her sentiments, and to

persuade her that her religious faith was very ill grounded. They asked

her what warrant there was in Scripture for prayers in an unknown tongue,

the use of images, or offering up the sacrament for the dead; and they

desired her to peruse St. Austin, and the other ancient doctors, who would

convince her of the errors of the Romish superstition, and prove that it

was founded merely on false miracles and lying stories.[***] The lady Mary

remained obstinate against all this advice, and declared herself willing

to endure death rather than relinquish her religion; she only feared, she

said, that she was not worthy to suffer martyrdom in so holy a cause: and

as for Protestant books, she thanked God, that as she never had, so she

hoped never to read any of them. Dreading further violence, she endeavored

to make an escape to her kinsman Charles; but her design was discovered

and prevented.[****] The emperor remonstrated in her behalf, and even

threatened hostilities if liberty of conscience were refused her: but

though the council, sensible that the kingdom was in no condition to

support with honor such a war, was desirous to comply, they found great

difficulty to overcome the scruples of the young king. He had been

educated in such a violent abhorrence of the mass and other popish rites,

which he regarded as impious and idolatrous, that he should participate,

he thought, in the sin, if he allowed its commission: and when at last the

importunity of Cranmer, Ridley, and Poinet prevailed somewhat over his

opposition, he burst into tears; lamenting his sister’s obstinacy, and

bewailing his own hard fate, that he must suffer her to continue in such

an abominable mode of worship.

 

The great object, at this time, of antipathy among the Protestant sects

was Popery, or, more properly, speaking, the Papists. These they regarded

as the common enemy, who threatened every moment to overwhelm the

evangelical faith, and destroy its partisans by fire and sword: they had

not as yet had leisure to attend to the other minute differences among

themselves, which afterwards became the object of such furious quarrels

and animosities, and threw the whole kingdom into combustion. Several

Lutheran divines, who had reputation in those days, Bucer, Peter Martyr,

and others, were induced to take shelter in England, from the persecutions

which the emperor exercised in Germany; and they received protection and

encouragement. John Alasco, a Polish nobleman, being expelled his country

by the rigors of the Catholics, settled during some time at Embden in East

Friezland, where he became preacher to a congregation of the reformed.

Foreseeing the persecutions which ensued, he removed to England, and

brought his congregation along with him. The council, who regard them as

industrious, useful people, and desired to invite over others of the same

character, not only gave them the church of Augustine Friars for the

exercise of their religion, but granted them a charter, by which they were

erected into a corporation, consisting of a superintendent and four

assisting ministers. This ecclesiastical establishment was quite

independent of the church of England, and differed from it in some rites

and ceremonies.[*]

 

These differences among the Protestants were matter of triumph to the

Catholics; who insisted, that the moment men departed from the authority

of the church, they lost all criterion of truth and falsehood in matters

of religion, and must be carried away by every wind of doctrine. The

continual variations of every sect of Protestants afforded them the same

topic of reasoning. The book of common prayer suffered in England a new

revisal, and some rites and ceremonies which had given offence were

omitted.[**] * Mem. Cranm. p. 234.

 

The speculative doctrines, or the metaphysics of religion, were also

reduced to forty-two articles. These were intended to obviate further

divisions and variations; and the compiling of them had been postponed

till the establishment of the liturgy, which was justly regarded as a more

material object to the people. The eternity of hell torments is asserted

in this confession of faith; and care is also taken to inculcate, not only

that no heathen, how virtuous soever, can escape an endless state of the

most exquisite misery, but also that every one who presumes to maintain

that any pagan can possibly be saved, is himself exposed to the penalty of

eternal perdition.[*]

 

The theological zeal of the council, though seemingly fervent, went not so

far as to make them neglect their own temporal concerns, which seem to

have ever been uppermost in their thoughts: they even found leisure to

attend to the public interest; nay, to the commerce of the nation, which

was at that time very little the object of general study or attention. The

trade of England had anciently been carried on altogether by foreigners,

chiefly the inhabitants of the Hanse Towns, or Easterlings, as they were

called; and in order to encourage these merchants to settle in England,

they had been erected into a corporation by Henry III., had obtained a

patent, were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from several heavy

duties paid by other aliens. So ignorant were the English of commerce,

that this company, usually denominated the merchants of the “stil-yard,”

engrossed, even down to the reign of Edward, almost the whole foreign

trade of the kingdom; and as they naturally employed the shipping of their

own country, the navigation of England was also in a very languishing

condition. It was therefore thought proper by the council to seek

pretences for annulling the privileges of this corporation, privileges

which put them nearly on an equal footing with Englishmen in the duties

which they paid; and as such patents were, during that age, granted by the

absolute power of the king, men were the less surprised to find them

revoked by the same authority. Several remonstrances were made against

this innovation by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Hanse Towns; but the council

persevered in their resolution, and the good effects of it soon became

visible to the nation. The English merchants, by their very situation as

natives, had advantages above foreigners in the purchase of cloth, wool,

and other commodities; though these advantages had not hitherto been

sufficient to rouse then industry, or engage them to become rivals to this

opulent company: but when aliens’ duty was also imposed upon all

foreigners indiscriminately, the English were tempted to enter into

commerce; and a spirit of industry began to appear in the kingdom.[*]

 

About the same time a treaty was made with Gustavus Ericson, king of

Sweden, by which it was stipulated, that if he sent bullion into England,

he might export English commodities without paying custom; that he should

carry bullion to no other prince; that if he sent ozimus, steel, copper,

etc., he should pay custom for English commodities as an Englishman; and

that if he sent other merchandise, he should have free intercourse, paying

custom as a stranger.[**] The bullion sent over by Sweden, though it could

not be in great quantity, set the mint to work: good specie was coined,

and much of the base metal formerly issued was recalled: a circumstance

which tended extremely to the encouragement of commerce.

 

But all these schemes for promoting industry were likely to prove abortive

by the fear of domestic convulsions, arising from the ambition of Warwick.

That nobleman, not contented with the station which he had attained,

carried further his pretensions, and had gained partisans who were

disposed to second him in every enterprise. The last earl of

Northumberland died without issue; and as Sir Thomas Piercy, his brother,

had been attainted on account of the share which he had in the Yorkshire

insurrection during the late reign, the title was at present extinct, and

the estate was vested in the crown. Warwick now procured to himself a

grant of those ample possessions, which lay chiefly in the north, the most

warlike part of the kingdom; and was dignified with the title of duke of

Northumberland. His friend Paulet, Lord St. John, the treasurer, was

created, first, earl of Wiltshire, then marquis of Winchester: Sir William

Herbert obtained the title of earl of Pembroke.

 

But the ambition of Northumberland made him regard all increase of

possessions and titles, either to himself or his artisans, as steps only

to further acquisitions. Finding that Somerset, though degraded from his

dignity, and even lessened in the public opinion by his spiritless

conduct, still enjoyed a considerable share of popularity, he determined

to ruin the man whom he regarded as the chief obstacle to the attainment

of his hopes. The alliance which had been contracted between the families

had produced no cordial union, and only enabled Northumberland to compass

with more certainty the destruction of his rival. He secretly gained many

of the friends and servants of that unhappy nobleman: he sometimes

terrified him by the appearance of danger; sometimes provoked him by ill

usage. The unguarded Somerset often broke out into menacing expressions

against Northumberland: at other times he formed rash projects, which he

immediately abandoned his treacherous confidants carried to his enemy

every passionate word which dropped from him: they revealed the schemes

which they themselves had first suggested: and Northumberland, thinking

that the proper season was now come, began to act in an open manner

against him.

 

In one night, the duke of Somerset, Lord Grey, David and John Seymour,

Hammond, and Neudigate, two of the duke’s servants, Sir Ralph Vane, and

Sir Thomas Palmer, were arrested and committed to custody. Next day, the

duchess of Somerset, with her favorites Crane and his wife, Sir Miles

Partridge, Sir Michael Stanhope, Bannister, and others, was thrown into

prison. Sir Thomas Palmer, who had all along acted as a spy upon Somerset,

accused him of having formed a design to raise an insurrection in the

north, to attack the gens d’armes on a muster day, to secure the Tower,

and to raise a rebellion in London: but, what was the only probable

accusation, he asserted, that Somerset had once laid a project for

murdering Northumberland, Northampton, and Pembroke at a banquet which was

to be given them by Lord Paget Crane and his wife confirmed Palmer’s

testimony with regard to this last design; and it appears that some rash

scheme of that nature had really been mentioned, though no regular

conspiracy had been formed, or means prepared for its execution Hammond

confessed that the duke had armed men to guard him one night in his house

at Greenwich.

 

Somerset was brought to his trial before the marquis of Winchester,

created high steward. Twenty-seven peers composed the jury, among whom

were Northumberland, Pembroke, and Northampton, whom decency should have

hindered from acting as judges in the trial of a man that appeared to be

their capital enemy. Somerset was accused of high treason, on account of

the projected insurrections, and of felony in laying a design to murder

privy counsellors.

 

We have a very imperfect account of all state trials during that ago,

which is a sensible defect in our history; but it appears that some more

regularity was observed in the management of this prosecution than had

usually been employed in like cases. The witnesses were at least examined

by the privy council; and though they were neither produced in court, nor

confronted with the prisoner, (circumstances required by the strict

principles of equity,) their depositions were given in to the jury. The

proof seems to have been lame with regard to the treasonable part of the

charge; and Somerset’s defence was so satisfactory, that the peers gave

verdict in his favor: the intention alone of assaulting the privy

counsellors was supported by tolerable evidence; and the jury brought him

in guilty of felony. The prisoner himself confessed that he had expressed

his intention of murdering Northumberland and the other lords; but had not

formed any resolution on that head: and when he received sentence, he

asked pardon of those peers for the designs which he had hearkened to

against them. The people, by whom Somerset was beloved, hearing the first

part of his sentence, by which he was acquitted from treason, expressed

their joy by loud acclamations: but their satisfaction was suddenly damped

on finding that he was condemned to death for felony.[*]

 

1552.

 

Care had been taken by Northumberland’s emissaries to prepossess the young

king against his uncle; and lest he should relent, no access was given to

any of Somerset’s friends, and the prince was kept from reflection by a

continued series of occupations and amusements. At last the prisoner was

brought to the scaffold on Tower Hill, amidst great crowds of spectators,

who bore him such sincere kindness, that they entertained to the last

moment the fond hopes of his pardon.[**] Many of them rushed in to dip

their hand-kerchiefs in his blood, which they long preserved as a precious

relic; and some of them soon after, when Northumberland met with a like

doom, upbraided him with this cruelty, and displayed to him these symbols

of his crime. Somerset indeed, though many actions of his life were

exceptionable, seems in general to have merited a better fate; and the

faults which he committed were owing to weakness, not to any bad

intention. His virtues were better calculated for private than for public

life; and by his want of penetration and firmness, he was ill fitted to

extricate himself from those cabals and violences to which that age was so

much addicted. Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael Stanhope, Sir Miles

Partridge, and Sir Ralph Vane, all of them Somerset’s friends, were

brought to their trial, condemned, and executed: great injustice seems to

have been used in their prosecution.

 

Lord Paget, chancellor of the duchy, was on some pretence tried in the

star chamber, and condemned in a fine of six thousand pounds, with the

loss of his office. To mortify him the more, he was degraded from the

order of the garter; as unworthy, on account of his mean birth, to share

that honor.[*] Lord Rich, chancellor, was also compelled to resign his

office, on the discovery of some marks of friendship which he had shown to

Somerset.

 

The day after the execution of Somerset, a session of parliament was held,

in which further advances were made towards the establishment of the

reformation. The new liturgy was authorized; and penalties were enacted

against all those who absented themselves from public worship.[**] To use

the mass had already been prohibited under severe penalties; so that the

reformers, it appears, whatever scope they had given to their own private

judgment, in disputing the tenets of the ancient religion, were resolved

not to allow the same privilege to others, and the practice, nay the very

doctrine of toleration, was at that time equally unknown to all sects and

parties. To dissent from the religion of the magistrate, was universally

conceived to be as criminal as to question his title, or rebel against his

authority.

 

A law was enacted against usury; that is, against taking any interest for

money.[***] This act was the remains of ancient superstition; but being

found extremely iniquitous in itself, as well as prejudicial to commerce,

it was afterwards repealed in the twelfth of Elizabeth. The common rate of

interest, notwithstanding the law, was at this time fourteen per

cent.[****]

 

A bill was introduced by the ministry into the house of lords, renewing

those rigorous statutes of treason which had been abrogated in the

beginning of this reign; and though the peers, by their high station,

stood most exposed to these tempests of state, yet had they so little

regard to public security, or even to their own true interest, that they

passed the bill with only one dissenting voice.[*] But the commons

rejected it, and prepared a new bill, that passed into a law, by which it

was enacted, that whoever should call the king, or any of his heirs named

in the statute of the thirty-fifth of the last reign, heretic, schismatic,

tyrant, infidel, or usurper of the crown, should forfeit, for the first

offence, their goods and chattels, and be imprisoned during pleasure; for

the second, should incur a “prÃ¦munire;” for the third, should be attainted

for treason. But if any should unadvisedly utter such a slander in

writing, printing, painting, carving, or graving, he was, for the first

offence, to be held a traitor.[**] It may be worthy of notice, that the

king and his next heir, the lady Mary, were professedly of different

religions; and religions which threw on each other the imputation of

heresy, schism, idolatry, profaneness, blasphemy, wickedness, and all the

opprobrious epithets that religious zeal has invented. It was almost

impossible, therefore, for the people, if they spoke at all on these

subjects, not to fall into the crime so severely punished by the statute;

and the jealousy of the commons for liberty, though it led them to reject

the bill of treasons sent to them by the lords, appears not to have been

very active, vigilant, or clearsighted.

 

The commons annexed to this bill a clause, which was of more importance

than the bill itself, that no one should be convicted of any kind of

treason, unless the crime were proved by the oaths of two witnesses,

confronted with the prisoner. The lords for some time scrupled to pass

this clause, though conformable to the most obvious principles of equity.

But the members of that house trusted for protection to their present

personal interest and power, and neglected the noblest and most permanent

security, that of laws.

 

The house of peers passed a bill, whose object was, making a provision for

the poor; but the commons, not choosing that a money bill should begin in

the upper house, framed a new act to the same purpose. By this act the

churchwardens were empowered to collect charitable contributions; and if

any refused to give, or dissuaded others from that charity the bishop of

the diocese was empowered to proceed against them. Such large

discretionary powers intrusted to the prelates seem as proper an object of

jealousy as the authority assumed by the peers.[*]

 

There was another occasion in which the parliament reposed an unusual

confidence in the bishops. They empowered them to proceed against such as

neglected the Sundays and holy-day.[**] But these were unguarded

concessions granted to the church: the general humor of the age rather led

men to bereave the ecclesiastics of all power, and even to pillage them of

their property: many clergymen, about this time, were obliged for a

subsistence to turn carpenters or tailors, and some kept alehouses.[***]

The bishops themselves were generally reduced to poverty, and held both

their revenues and spiritual office by a very precarious and uncertain

tenure.

 

Tonstal, bishop of Durham, was one of the most eminent prelates of that

age, still less for the dignity of his see, than for his own personal

merit, his learning, moderation, humanity, and beneficence. He had

opposed, by his vote and authority, all innovations in religion; but as

soon as they were enacted, he had always submitted, and had conformed to

every theological system which had been established. His known probity had

made this compliance be ascribed, not to an interested or time-serving

spirit, but to a sense of duty, which led him to think that all private

opinion ought to be sacrificed to the great concern of public peace and

tranquillity. The general regard paid to his character had protected him

from any severe treatment during the administration of Somerset; but when

Northumberland gained the ascendant, he was thrown into prison; and as

that rapacious nobleman had formed a design of seizing the revenues of the

see of Durham, and of acquiring to himself a principality in the northern

counties, he was resolved, in order to effect his purpose, to deprive

Tonstal of his bishopric. A bill of attainder, therefore, on pretence of

misprision of treason, was introduced into the house of peers against the

prelate; and it passed with the opposition only of Lord Stourton, a

zealous Catholic, and of Cranmer, who always bore a cordial and sincere

friendship to the bishop of Durham. But when the bill was sent down to the

commons, they required that witnesses should be examined, that Tonstal

should be allowed to defend himself, and that he should be confronted with

his accusers; and when these demands were refused, they rejected the bill.

 

This equity, so unusual in the parliament during that age, was ascribed,

by Northumberland and his partisans, not to any regard for liberty and

justice, but to the prevalence of Somerset’s faction in a house of commons

which, being chosen during the administration of that nobleman, had been

almost entirely filled with his creatures. They were confirmed in this

opinion, when they found that a bill, ratifying the attainder of Somerset

and his accomplices, was also rejected by the commons, though it had

passed the upper house. A resolution was therefore taken to dissolve the

parliament, which had sitten during this whole reign; and soon after to

summon a new one.

 

Northumberland, in order to insure to himself a house of commons entirely

obsequious to his will, ventured on an expedient which could not have been

practised, or even imagined, in an age when there was any idea or

comprehension of liberty. He engaged the king to write circular letters to

all the sheriffs, in which he enjoined them to inform the freeholders,

that they were required to choose men of knowledge and experience for

their representatives. After this general exhortation, the king continued

in these words: “And yet, nevertheless, our pleasure is, that where our

privy council, or any of them, shall, in our behalf, recommend within

their jurisdiction men of learning and wisdom; in such cases their

directions shall be regarded and followed, as tending to the same end

which we desire; that is, to have this assembly composed of the persons in

our realm the best fitted to give advice and good counsel.”[*] Several

letters were sent from the king, recommending members to particular

counties; Sir Richard Cotton to Hampshire; Sir William Fitzwilliams and

Sir Henry Nevil to Berkshire; Sir William Drury and Sir Henry Benningfield

to Suffolk, etc. But though some counties only received this species of

congÃ© d’Ã©lire from the king; the recommendations from the privy council

and the counsellors, we may fairly presume, would extend to the greater

part, if not the whole, of the kingdom.

 

It is remarkable, that this attempt was made during the reign of a minor

king, when the royal authority is usually weakest that it was patiently

submitted to; and that it gave so little umbrage as scarcely to be taken

notice of by any historian. The painful and laborious collector above

cited, who never omits the most trivial matter, is the only person that

has thought this memorable letter worthy of being transmitted to

posterity.

 

1553.

 

The parliament answered Northumberland’s expectations. As Tonstal had been

in the interval deprived of his bishopric in an arbitrary manner, by the

sentence of lay commissioners appointed to try him, the see of Durham was,

by act of parliament, divided into two bishoprics, which had certain

portions of the revenue assigned them. The regalities of the see, which

included the jurisdiction of a count palatine, were given by the king to

Northumberland; nor is it to be doubted but that noblemen had also

purposed to make rich plunder of the revenue, as was then usual with the

courtiers whenever a bishopric became vacant.

 

The commons gave the ministry another mark of attachment, which was at

that time the most sincere of any, the most cordial, and the most

difficult to be obtained: they granted a supply of two subsidies and two

fifteenths. To render this present the more acceptable, they voted a

preamble, containing a long accusation of Somerset, “for involving the

king in wars, wasting his treasure, engaging him in much debt, embasing

the coin, and giving occasion for a most terrible rebellion.”[*]

 

The debts of the crown were at this time considerable. The king had

received from France four hundred thousand crowns on delivering Boulogne;

he had reaped profit from the sale of some chantry lands; the churches had

been spoiled of all their plate and rich ornaments, which, by a decree of

council, without any pretence of law or equity, had been converted to the

king’s use: [**] yet such had been the rapacity of the courtiers, that the

crown owed about three hundred thousand pounds: and great dilapidations

were at the same time made of the royal demesnes. The young prince showed,

among other virtues, a disposition to frugality, which, had he lived,

would soon have retrieved these losses; but as his health was declining

very fast, the present emptiness of the exchequer was a sensible obstacle

to the execution of those projects which the ambition of Northumberland

had founded on the prospect of Edward’s approaching end.

 

That nobleman represented to the prince, whom youth and an infirm state of

health made susceptible of any impression, that his two sisters, Mary and

Elizabeth, had both of them been declared illegitimate by act of

parliament; and though Henry by his will had restored them to a place in

the succession, the nation would never submit to see the throne of England

filled by a bastard: that they were the king’s sisters by the half blood

only; and even if they were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his

heirs and successors: that the queen of Scots stood excluded by the late

king’s will; and being an alien, had lost by law all right of inheriting;

not to mention that, as she was betrothed to the dauphin, she would, by

her succession, render England, as she had already done Scotland, a

province to France: that the certain consequence of his sister Mary’s

succession, or that of the queen of Scots was the abolition of the

Protestant religion, and the repeal of the laws enacted in favor of the

reformation, and the reÃ«stabishment of the usurpation and idolatry of the

church of Rome, that, fortunately for England, the same order of

succession which justice required, was also the most conformable to public

interest; and there was not on any side any just ground for doubt or

deliberation: that when these three princesses were excluded by such solid

reasons, the succession devolved on the marchioness of Dorset, elder

daughter of the French queen and the duke of Suffolk: that the next heir

of the marchioness was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the most amiable

character, accomplished by the best education, both in literature and

religion, and every way worthy of a crown; and that even if her title by

blood were doubtful, which there was no just reason to pretend, the king

was possessed of the same power that his father enjoyed, and might leave

her the crown by letters patent. These reasonings made impression on the

young prince; and above all, his zealous attachment to the Protestant

religion made him apprehend the consequences if so bigoted a Catholic as

his sister Mary should succeed to the throne. And though he bore a tender

affection to the lady Elizabeth, who was liable to no such objection means

were found to persuade him that he could not exclude the one sister, on

account of illegitimacy, without giving also an exclusion to the other.

 

 ENLARGE
 

Northumberland, finding that his arguments were likely to operate on the

king, began to prepare the other parts of his scheme. Two sons of the duke

of Suffolk by a second venter having died this season of the sweating

sickness, that title was extinct; and Northumberland engaged the king to

bestow it on the marquis of Dorset. By means of this favor, and of others

which he conferred upon him, he persuaded the new duke of Suffolk and the

duchess, to give their daughter, the lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth

son, the Lord Guildford Dudley. In order to fortify himself by further

alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady Catharine Gray,

second daughter of Suffolk, and Lord Herbert, eldest son of the earl of

Pembroke. He also married his own daughter to Lord Hastings, eldest son of

the earl of Huntingdon.[*] These marriages were solemnized with great pomp

and festivity; and the people, who hated Northumberland, could not forbear

expressing their indignation at seeing such public demonstrations of joy

during the languishing state of the young prince’s health.

 

Edward had been seized in the foregoing year, first with the measles, then

with the small-pox; but having perfectly recovered from both these

distempers, the nation entertained hopes that they would only serve to

confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a progress through some

parts of the kingdom. It was suspected that he had there overheated

himself in exercise; he was seized with a cough, which proved obstinate,

and gave way neither to regimen nor medicines: several fatal symptoms of

consumption appeared; and though it was hoped that, as the season

advanced, his youth and temperance might get the better of the malady, men

saw with great concern his bloom and vigor insensibly decay. The general

attachment to the young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,

made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment declined in health, from

the time that Lord Robert Dudley had been put about him in quality of

gentleman of the bedchamber.

 

The languishing state of Edward’s health made Northumberland the more

intent on the execution of his project. He removed all, except his own

emissaries, from about the king; he himself attended him with the greatest

assiduity: he pretended the most anxious concern for his health and

welfare; and by all these artifices he prevailed on the young prince to

give his final consent to the settlement projected. Sir Edward Montague,

chief justice of the common pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Bromley,

two judges, with the attorney and solicitor-general, were summoned to the

council, where, after the minutes of the intended deed were read to them,

the king required them to draw them up in the form of letters patent. They

hesitated to obey, and desired time to consider of it. The more they

reflected the greater danger they found in compliance. The settlement of

the crown by Henry VIII. had been made in consequence of an act of

parliament; and by another act, passed in the beginning of this reign, it

was declared treason in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors, to

attempt on the right of another, or change the order of succession. The

judges pleaded these reasons before the council. They urged, that such a

patent as was intended would be entirely invalid; that it would subject,

not only the judges who drew it, but every counsellor who signed it, to

the pains of treason; and that the only proper expedient, both for giving

sanction to the new settlement, and freeing its partisans from danger, was

to summon a parliament, and to obtain the consent of that assembly. The

king said, that he intended afterwards to follow that method, and would

call a parliament in which he purposed to have his settlement ratified;

but in the mean time he required the judges, on their allegiance, to draw

the patent in the form required. The council told the judges, that their

refusal would subject all of them to the pains of treason. Northumberland

gave to Montague the appellation of traitor; and said that he would in his

shirt fight any man in so just a cause as that of Lady Jane’s succession.

The judges were reduced to great difficulties between the dangers from the

law, and those which arose from the violence of present power and

authority.[*]

 

The arguments were canvassed in several different meetings between the

council and the judges, and no solution could be found of the

difficulties. At last, Montague proposed an expedient, which satisfied

both his brethren and the counsellors. He desired that a special

commission should be passed by the king and council, requiring the judges

to draw a patent for the new settlement of the crown; and that a pardon

should immediately after be granted them for any offence which they might

have incurred by their compliance. When the patent was drawn, and brought

to the bishop of Ely, Chancellor, in order to have the great seal affixed

to it, this prelate required that all the judges should previously sign

it. Gosnald at first refused; and it was with much difficulty that he was

prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland to comply; but the

constancy of Sir James Hales, who, though a zealous Protestant, preferred

justice on this occasion to the prejudices of his party, could not be

shaken by any expedient. The chancellor next required, for his greater

security, that all the privy counsellors should set their hands to the

patent: the intrigues of Northumberland, or the fears of his violence,

were so prevalent that the counsellors complied with this demand. Cranmer

alone hesitated during some time, but at last yielded to the earnest and

pathetic entreaties of the king.[*] Cecil, at that time secretary of

state, pretended afterwards that he only signed as witness to the king’s

subscription. And thus, by the king’s letters patent, the two princesses,

Mary and Elizabeth, were set aside; and the crown was settled on the heirs

of the duchess of Suffolk; for the duchess herself was content to give

place to her daughters.

 

After this settlement was made, with so many inauspicious circumstances,

Edward visibly declined every day, and small hopes were entertained of his

recovery. To make matters worse, his physicians were dismissed by

Northumberland’s advice, and by an order of council; and he was put into

the hands of an ignorant woman, who undertook in a little time to restore

him to his former state of health. After the use of her medicines, all the

bad symptoms increased to the most violent degree: he felt a difficulty of

speech and breathing; his pulse failed, his legs swelled, his color became

livid, and many other symptoms appeared of his approaching end. He expired

at Greenwich, in the sixteenth year of his age, and the seventh of his

reign.

 

All the English historians dwell with pleasure on the excellent qualities

of this young prince; whom the flattering promises of hope, joined to many

real virtues, had made an object of tender affection to the public. He

possessed mildness of disposition, application to study and business, a

capacity to learn and judge, and an attachment to equity and justice. He

seems only to have contracted, from his education, and from the genius of

the age in which he lived, too much of a narrow prepossession in matters

of religion, which made him incline somewhat to bigotry and persecution:

but as the bigotry of Protestants, less governed by priests, lies under

more restraints than that of Catholics, the effects of this malignant

quality were the less to be apprehended if a longer life had been granted

to young Edward
