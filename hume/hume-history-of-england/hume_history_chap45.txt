The crown of England was never transmitted from father to son with greater

tranquillity than it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart.

During the whole reign of Elizabeth, the eyes of men had been employed in

search of her successor; and when old age made the prospect of her death

more immediate, there appeared none but the king of Scots who could

advance any just claim or pretension to the throne. He was great-grandson

of Margaret, elder daughter of Henry VII.; and, on the failure of the male

line, his hereditary right remained unquestionable. If the religion of

Mary queen of Scots, and the other prejudices contracted against her, had

formed any considerable obstacle to her succession, these objections,

being entirely personal, had no place with regard to her son. Men also

considered, that though the title derived from blood had been frequently

violated since the Norman conquest, such licenses had proceeded more from

force or intrigue than from any deliberate maxims of government. The

lineal heir had still in the end prevailed: and both his exclusion and

restoration had been commonly attended with such convulsions as were

sufficient to warn all prudent men not lightly to give way to such

irregularities. If the will of Henry VIII., authorized by act of

parliament, had tacitly excluded the Scottish line, the tyranny and

caprices of that monarch had been so signal, that a settlement of this

nature, unsupported by any just reason, had no authority with the people.

Queen Elizabeth, too, with her dying breath, had recognized the undoubted

title of her kinsman James; and the whole nation seemed to dispose

themselves with joy and pleasure for his reception. Though born and

educated amidst a foreign and hostile people, men hoped, from his

character of moderation and wisdom, that he would embrace the maxims of an

English monarch; and the prudent foresaw greater advantages resulting from

a union with Scotland, than disadvantages from submitting to a prince of

that nation. The alacrity with which the English looked towards the

successor had appeared so evident to Elizabeth, that, concurring, with

other causes, it affected her with the deepest melancholy; and that wise

princess, whose penetration and experience had given her the greatest

insight into human affairs, had not yet, sufficiently weighed the

ingratitude of courtiers and levity of the people.

 

As victory abroad and tranquillity at home had attended this princess, she

left the nation in such flourishing circumstances, that her successor

possessed every advantage, except that of comparison with her illustrious

name, when he mounted the throne of England. The king’s journey from

Edinburgh to London immediately afforded to the inquisitive some

circumstances of comparison, which even the natural partiality in favor of

their new sovereign could not interpret to his advantage. As he passed

along, all ranks of men flocked about him from every quarter, allured by

interest or curiosity. Great were the rejoicings, and loud and hearty the

acclamations, which resounded from all sides; and every one could remember

how the affability and popular manners of their queen displayed themselves

amidst such concourse and exultation of her subjects. But James, though

sociable and familiar with his friends and courtiers, hated the bustle of

a mixed multitude; and though far from disliking flattery, yet was he

still fonder of tranquillity and ease. He issued, therefore, a

proclamation, forbidding this resort of people, on pretence of the

scarcity of provisions, and other inconveniencies, which, he said, would

necessarily attend it.[*]

 

He was not, however, insensible to the great flow of affection which

appeared in his new subjects; and being himself of an affectionate temper,

he seems to have been in haste to make them some return of kindness and

good offices. To this motive, probably, we are to ascribe that profusion

of titles which was observed in the beginning of his reign; when, in six

weeks’ time after his entrance into the kingdom, he is computed to have

bestowed knighthood on no less than two hundred and thirty-seven persons.

If Elizabeth’s frugality of honors, as well as of money, had formerly been

repined at, it began now to be valued and esteemed, and every one was

sensible that the king, by his lavish and premature conferring of favors,

had failed of obliging the persons on whom he bestowed them. Titles of all

kinds became so common, that they were scarcely marks of distinction; and

being distributed, without choice or deliberation, to persons unknown to

the prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility and good nature,

than of any determined friendship or esteem.

 

A pasquinade was affixed to St. Paul’s, in which an art was promised to be

taught, very necessary to assist frail memories in retaining the names of

the new nobility.[*]

 

We may presume that the English would have thrown less blame on the king’s

facility in bestowing favors, had these been confined entirely to their

own nation, and had not been shared out, in too unequal proportions, to

his old subjects. James, who, through his whole reign, was more guided by

temper and inclination than by the rules of political prudence, had

brought with him great numbers of his Scottish courtiers, whose impatience

and importunity were apt, in many particulars, to impose on the easy

nature of their master, and extort favors of which, it is natural to

imagine, his English subjects would loudly complain. The duke of Lenox,

the earl of Marre, Lord Hume, Lord Kinloss, Sir George Hume, Secretary

Elphinstone,[**] were immediately added to the English privy council. Sir

George Hume, whom he created earl of Dunbar, was his declared favorite as

long as that nobleman lived, and was one of the wisest and most virtuous,

though the least powerful, of all those whom the king ever honored with

that distinction. Hay, some time after, was created Viscount Doncaster,

then earl of Carlisle, and got an immense fortune from the crown, all

which he spent in a splendid and courtly manner. Ramsay obtained the title

of earl of Holderness; and many others being raised on a sudden to the

highest elevation, increased, by their insolence, that envy which

naturally attended them as strangers and ancient enemies.

 

It must, however, be owned, in justice to James, that he left almost all

the chief offices in the hands of Elizabeth’s ministers, and trusted the

conduct of political concerns, both foreign and domestic, to his English

subjects. Among these, Secretary Cecil, created successively Lord

Effindon, Viscount Cranborne, and earl of Salisbury, was always regarded

as his prime minister and chief counsellor. Though the capacity and

penetration of this minister were sufficiently known, his favor with the

king created surprise on the accession of that monarch. The secret

correspondence into which he had entered with James, and which had

sensibly contributed to the easy reception of that prince in England, laid

the foundation of Cecil’s credit; and while all his former associates, Sir

Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey, Lord Cobham, were discountenanced on account of

their animosity against Essex, as well as for other reasons, this minister

was continued in employment, and treated with the greatest confidence and

regard.

 

The capacity of James and his ministers in negotiation was immediately put

to trial on the appearance of ambassadors from almost all the princes and

states of Europe, in order to congratulate him on his accession, and form

with him new treaties and alliances. Besides ministers from Venice,

Denmark, the Palatinate; Henry Frederic of Nassau, assisted by Barnevelt,

the pensionary of Holland, was ambassador from the states of the United

Provinces. Aremberg was sent by Archduke Albert, and Taxis was expected in

a little time from Spain. But he who most excited the attention of the

public, both on account of his own merit and that of his master, was the

marquis of Rosni, afterwards duke of Sully, prime minister and favorite of

Henry IV. of France.

 

When the dominions of the house of Austria devolved on Philip II., all

Europe was struck with terror, lest the power of a family, which had been

raised by fortune, should now be carried to an immeasurable height by the

wisdom and conduct of this monarch. But never were apprehensions found in

the event to be more groundless. Slow without prudence, ambitious without

enterprise, false without deceiving any body, and refined without any true

judgment; such was the character of Philip, and such the character which,

during his lifetime, and after his death, he impressed on the Spanish

councils. Revolted or depopulated provinces, discontented or indolent

inhabitants, were the spectacles which those dominions, lying in every

climate of the globe, presented to Philip III., a weak prince, and to the

duke of Lerma, a minister weak and odious. But though military discipline,

which still remained, was what alone gave some appearance of life and

vigor to that languishing body, yet so great was the terror produced by

former power and ambition, that the reduction of the house of Austria was

the object of men’s vows throughout all the states of Christendom. It was

not perceived, that the French empire, now united in domestic peace, and

governed by the most heroic and most amiable prince that adorns modern

story, was become, of itself, a sufficient counterpoise to the Spanish

greatness. Perhaps that prince himself did not perceive it, when he

proposed, by his minister, a league with James, in conjunction with

Venice, the United Provinces, and the northern crowns, in order to attack

the Austrian dominions on every side, and depress the exorbitant power of

that ambitious family.[*] But the genius of the English monarch was not

equal to such vast enterprises. The love of peace was his ruling passion;

and it was his peculiar felicity, that the conjunctures of the times

rendered the same object which was agreeable to him in the highest degree

advantageous to his people.

 

The French ambassador, therefore, was obliged to depart from these

extensive views, and to concert with James the means of providing for the

safety of the United Provinces: nor was this object altogether without its

difficulties. The king, before his accession, had entertained scruples

with regard to the revolt of the Low Countries; and being commonly open

and sincere,[**] he had, on many occasions, gone so far as to give to the

Dutch the appellation of rebels; [***] but having conversed more fully

with English ministers and courtiers, he found their attachment to that

republic so strong, and their opinion of common interest so established,

that he was obliged to sacrifice to politics his sense of justice; a

quality which, even when erroneous, is respectable as well as rare in a

monarch.

 

He therefore agreed with Rosni to support secretly the states general, in

concert with the king of France; lest their weakness and despair should

oblige them to submit to their old master. The articles of the treaty were

few and simple. It was stipulated, that the two kings should allow the

Dutch to levy forces in their respective dominions; and should underhand

remit to that republic the sum of one million four hundred thousand livres

a year, for the pay of these forces: that the whole sum should be advanced

by the king of France; but that the third of it should be deducted from

the debt due by him to Queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniards attacked

either of the princes, they agreed to assist each other; Henry with a

force of ten thousand men, James with that of six. This treaty, one of the

wisest and most equitable concluded by James during the course of his

reign was more the work of the prince himself, than any of his

ministers.[*]

 

Amidst the great tranquillity, both foreign and domestic with which the

nation was blest, nothing could be more surprising than the discovery of a

conspiracy to subvert the government, and to fix on the throne Arabella

Stuart, a near relation of the king’s by the family of Lenox, and

descended equally from Henry VII. Every thing remains still mysterious in

this conspiracy; and history can give us no clew to unravel it. Watson and

Clarke, two Catholic priests, were accused of the plot; Lord Grey, a

Puritan; Lord Cobham, a thoughtless man, of no fixed principle; and Sir

Walter Raleigh, suspected to be of that philosophical sect who were then

extremely rare in England, and who have since received the appellation of

“Free-thinkers;” together with these, Mr. Broke, brother to Lord Cobham,

Sir Griffin Markham, Mr. Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What cement could

unite men of-such discordant principles in so dangerous a combination,

what end they proposed, or what means proportioned to an undertaking of

this nature, has never yet been explained, and cannot easily be imagined.

As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were commonly believed, after the queen’s

death, to have opposed proclaiming the king till conditions should be made

with him, they were, upon that account, extremely obnoxious to the court

and ministry; and people were apt, at first, to suspect that the plot was

merely a contrivance of Secretary Cecil, to get rid of his old

confederates, now become his most inveterate enemies. But the confession,

as well as trial, of the criminals, put the matter beyond doubt.[**] And

though no one could find any marks of a concerted enterprise, it appeared

that men of furious and ambitious spirits, meeting frequently together,

and believing all the world discontented like themselves, had entertained

very criminal projects, and had even entered, some of them at least, into

a correspondence with Aremberg, the Flemish ambassador in order to give

disturbance to the new settlement.

 

The two priests[*] and Broke[**] were executed: Cobham, Grey, and Markham

were pardoned,[***] after they had laid their heads upon the block.[****]

Raleigh too was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in confinement

many years afterwards.

 

It appears from Sully’s Memoirs, that Raleigh secretly offered his

services to the French ambassador; and we may thence presume that, meeting

with a repulse from that quarter, he had recourse, for the same

unwarrantable purposes, to the Flemish minister. Such a conjecture we are

now enabled to form; but it must be confessed, that on his trial there

appeared no proof of this transaction, nor indeed any circumstance which

could justify his condemnation. He was accused by Cobham alone, in a

sudden fit of passion, upon hearing that Raleigh, when examined, had

pointed out some circumstances by which Cobham’s guilt might be known and

ascertained. This accusation Cobham afterwards retracted; and, soon after,

he retracted his retractation. Yet upon the written evidence of this

single witness, a man of no honor or understanding, and so contradictory

in his testimony; not confronted with Raleigh; not supported by any

concurring circumstance; was that great man, contrary to all law and

equity, found guilty by the jury. His name was at that time extremely

odious in England; and every man was pleased to give sentence against the

capital enemy of Essex, the favorite of the people.

 

Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attorney-general, managed the

cause for the crown, and threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse, as may be

deemed a great reflection, not only on his own memory, but even, in some

degree, on the manners of the age. Traitor, monster, viper, and spider of

hell, are the terms which he employs against one of the most illustrious

men of the kingdom, who was under trial for life and fortune, and who

defended himself with temper, eloquence, and courage.[v]

 

1604.

 

The next occupation of the king was entirely according to his heart’s

content. He was employed in dictating magisterially to an assembly of

divines concerning points of faith and discipline, and in receiving the

applauses of these holy men for his superior zeal and learning. The

religious disputes between the church and the Puritans had induced him to

call a conference at Hampton Court, on pretence of finding expedients

which might reconcile both parties.

 

Though the severities of Elizabeth towards the Catholics had much weakened

that party, whose genius was opposite to the prevailing spirit of the

nation, like severities had had so little influence on the Puritans, who

were encouraged by that spirit, that no less than seven hundred and fifty

clergymen of that party signed a petition to the king on his accession;

and many more seemed willing to adhere to it.[*]

 

They all hoped that James, having received his education in Scotland, and

having sometimes professed an attachment to the church established there,

would at least abate the rigor of the laws enacted in support of the

ceremonies, and against Puritans; if he did not show more particular grace

and encouragement to that sect. But the king’s disposition had taken

strongly a contrary bias. The more he knew the Puritanical clergy, the

less favor he bore to them. He had remarked in their Scottish brethren a

violent turn towards republicanism, and a zealous attachment to civil

liberty; principles nearly allied to that religious enthusiasm with which

they were actuated. He had found, that being mostly persons of low birth

and mean education, the same lofty pretensions which attended them in

their familiar addresses to their Maker, of whom they believed themselves

the peculiar favorites, induced them to use the utmost freedoms with their

earthly sovereign. In both capacities, of monarch and of theologian, he

had experienced the little complaisance which they were disposed to show

him; whilst they controlled his commands, disputed his tenets, and to his

face, before the whole people, censured his conduct and behavior. If he

had submitted to the indignity of courting their favor, he treasured up,

on that account, the stronger resentment against them, and was determined

to make them feel, in their turn, the weight of his authority. Though he

had often met with resistance, and faction, and obstinacy in the Scottish

nobility, he retained no ill will to that order; or rather showed them

favor and kindness in England, beyond what reason and sound policy could

well justify; but the ascendant which the Presbyterian clergy had assumed

over him, was what his monarchical pride could never thoroughly digest.[*]

 

He dreaded likewise the popularity which attended this order of men in

both kingdoms. As useless austerities and self-denial are imagined, in

many religions, to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being, who created

us solely for happiness, James remarked, that the rustic severity of these

clergymen, and of their whole sect, had given them, in the eyes of the

multitude, the appearance of sanctity and virtue. Strongly inclined

himself to mirth, and wine, and sports of all kinds, he apprehended their

censure for his manner of life, free and disengaged. And being thus

averse, from temper as well as policy, to the sect of Puritans, he was

resolved, if possible, to prevent its further growth in England.

 

But it was the character of James’s councils, throughout his whole reign,

that they were more wise and equitable in their end, than prudent and

political in the means. Though justly sensible that no part of civil

administration required greater care or a nicer judgment than the conduct

of religious parties, he had not perceived that, in the same proportion as

this practical knowledge of theology is requisite, the speculative

refinements in it are mean, and even dangerous in a monarch. By entering

zealously into frivolous disputes, James gave them an air of importance

and dignity which they could not otherwise have acquired; and being

himself enlisted in the quarrel, he could no longer have recourse to

contempt and ridicule, the only proper method of appeasing it. The church

of England had not yet abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and

pre-destination: the puritans had not yet separated themselves from the

church, nor openly renounced Episcopacy. Though the spirit of the parties

was considerably different, the only appearing subjects of dispute were

concerning the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, the use of the

surplice, and the bowing at the name of Jesus. These were the mighty

questions which were solemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton Court

between some bishops and dignified clergymen on the one hand, and some

leaders of the Puritanical party on the other, the king and his ministers

being present.[*]

 

The Puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain of a partial and

unfair management of the dispute; as if the search after truth were in any

degree the object of such conferences, and a candid indifference, so rare

even among private inquirers in philosophical questions, could ever be

expected among princes and prelates, in a theological controversy. The

king, it must be confessed, from the beginning of the conference, showed

the strongest propensity to the established church, and frequently

inculcated a maxim which, though it has some foundation, is to be received

with great limitations, “No bishop, no king.” The bishops, in their turn,

were very liberal of their praises towards the royal disputant; and the

archbishop of Canterbury said, that “undoubtedly his majesty spake by the

special assistance of God’s Spirit.”[**] A few alterations in the liturgy

were agreed to, and both parties separated with mutual dissatisfaction.

 

It had frequently been the practice of the Puritans to form certain

assemblies, which they called “prophesyings;” where alternately, as moved

by the spirit, they displayed their pious zeal in prayers and

exhortations, and raised their own enthusiasm, as well as that of their

audience, to the highest pitch, from that social contagion which has so

mighty an influence on holy fervors, and from the mutual emulation which

arose in those trials of religious eloquence. Such dangerous societies had

been suppressed by Elizabeth; and the ministers in this conference moved

the king for their revival. But James sharply replied, “If you aim at a

Scottish presbytery, it agrees as well with monarchy as God and the devil.

There Jack and Tom, and Will and Dick, shall meet and censure me and my

council. Therefore I reiterate my former speech: Le roi s’avisera. Stay, I

pray, for one seven years, before you demand; and then, if you find me

grow pursy and fat, I may perchance hearken unto you. For that government

will keep me in breath, and give me work enough.”[***] Such were the

political considerations which determined the king in his choice among

religious parties.

 

The next assembly in which James displayed his learning and eloquence, was

one that showed more spirit of liberty than appeared among his bishops and

theologians The parliament was now ready to assemble; being so long

delayed on account of the plague, which had broken out in London, and

raged to such a degree, that above thirty thousand persons are computed to

have died of it in a year; though the city contained at that time little

more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.

 

The speech which the king made on opening the parliament, fully displays

his character, and proves him to have possessed more knowledge and better

parts, than prudence, or any just sense of decorum and propriety.[*]

Though few productions of the age surpass this performance either in style

or matter, it wants that majestic brevity and reserve which become a king

in his addresses to the great council of the nation. It contains, however,

a remarkable stroke of candor, where he confesses his too great facility

in yielding to the solicitations of suitors:[**] a fault which he promises

to correct, but which adhered to him, and distressed him, during the whole

course of his reign.

 

The first business in which the commons were engaged was of the utmost

importance to the preservation of their privileges; and neither temper nor

resolution was wanting in their conduct of it.

 

In the former periods of the English government, the house of commons was

of so small weight in the balance of the constitution, that little

attention had been given either by the crown, the people, or the house

itself, to the choice and continuance of the members. It had been usual,

after parliaments were prolonged beyond one session, for the chancellor to

exert a discretionary authority of issuing new writs to supply the place

of any members whom he judged incapable of attending, either on account of

their employment, their sickness, or other impediment. This practice gave

that minister, and consequently the prince, an unlimited power of

modelling at pleasure the representatives of the nation; yet so little

jealousy had it created, that the commons of themselves, without any court

influence or intrigue, and contrary to some former votes of their own,

confirmed it in the twenty-third of Elizabeth.[***]

 

At that time, though some members, whose places had been supplied on

account of sickness, having now recovered their health, appeared in the

house and claimed their seat, such was the authority of the chancellor,

that, merely out of respect to him, his sentence was adhered to, and the

new members were continued in their places. Here a most dangerous

prerogative was conferred on the crown: but to show the genius of that

age, or rather the channels in which power then ran, the crown put very

little value on this authority; insomuch that two days afterwards the

chancellor of himself resigned it back to the commons, and gave them power

to judge of a particular vacancy in their house. And when the question

concerning the chancellor’s new writs was again brought on the carpet

towards the end of the session, the commons were so little alarmed at the

precedent, that though they readmitted some old members, whose seats had

been vacated on account of slight indispositions, yet they confirmed the

chancellor’s sentence, in instances where the distemper appeared to have

been dangerous and incurable.[*]

 

Nor did they proceed any further in vindication of their privileges than

to vote, “That during the sitting of parliament, there do not, at any

time, any writ go out for choosing or returning any member without the

warrant of the house.” In Elizabeth’s reign, we may remark, and the reigns

preceding, sessions of parliament were not usually the twelfth part so

long as the vacations; and during the latter, the chancellor’s power, if

he pleased to exert it, was confirmed, at least left, by this vote, as

unlimited and unrestrained as ever.

 

In a subsequent parliament, the absolute authority of the queen was

exerted in a manner still more open; and began for the first time to give

alarm to the commons. New writs having been issued by the chancellor when

there was no vacancy, and a controversy arising upon that incident, the

queen sent a message to the house, informing them that it were impertinent

for them to deal in such matters. These questions, she said, belonged only

to the chancellor; and she had appointed him to confer with the judges, in

order to settle all disputes with regard to elections. The commons had the

courage, a few days after, to vote, “That it was a most perilous

precedent, where two knights of a county were duly elected, if any new

writ should issue out for a second election without order of the house

itself: that the discussing and adjudging of this and such like

differences belonged only to the house; and that there should be no

message sent to the lord chancellor, not so much as to inquire what he had

done in the matter, because it was conceived to be a matter derogatory to

the power and privilege of the house.”[*] This is the most considerable,

and almost only instance of parliamentary liberty, which occurs during the

reign of that princess.

 

Outlaws, whether on account of debts or crimes, had been declared by the

judges[*] incapable of enjoying a seat in the house, where they must

themselves be lawgivers; but this opinion of the judges had been

frequently overruled. I find, however, in the case of Vaughan,[**] who was

questioned for an outlawry, that, having proved all his debts to have been

contracted by suretyship, and to have been most of them honestly

compounded, he was allowed, on account of these favorable circumstances,

to keep his seat; which plainly supposes, that otherwise it would have

been vacated on account of the outlawry.[***]

 

When James summoned this parliament, he issued a proclamation,[****] in

which, among many general advices, which, like a kind tutor, he bestowed

on his people, he strictly enjoins them not to choose any outlaw for their

representative. And he adds, “If any person take upon him the place of

knight, citizen, or burgess, not being duly elected, according to the laws

and statutes in that behalf provided, and according to the purport,

effect, and true meaning of this our proclamation, then every person so

offending to be fined or imprisoned for the same.” A proclamation here was

plainly put on the same footing with a law, and that in so delicate a

point as the right of elections; most alarming circumstances, had there

not been reason to believe that this measure, being entered into so early

in the king’s reign, proceeded more from precipitation and mistake, than

from any serious design of invading the privileges of parliament.[v]

 

Sir Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the county of Bucks; and his

return, as usual, was made into chancery. The chancellor, pronouncing him

an outlaw, vacated his seat and issued writs for a new election.[*] Sir

John Fortescue was chosen in his place by the county: but the first act of

the house was to reverse the chancellor’s sentence, and restore Sir

Francis to his seat. At the king’s suggestion, the lords desired a

conference on the subject; but were absolutely refused by the commons, as

the question entirely regarded their own privileges.[**] The commons,

however, agreed to make a remonstrance to the king by the mouth of their

speaker; in which they maintained that, though the returns were by form

made into chancery, yet the sole right of judging with regard to elections

belonged to the house itself, not to the chancellor.[***] James was not

satisfied, and ordered a conference between the house and the judges,

whose opinion in this case was opposite to that of the commons. This

conference, he said, he commanded as an “absolute” king;[****] an epithet,

we are apt to imagine, not very grateful to English ears, but one to which

they had already been somewhat accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth.[v]

44 He

added, “That all their privileges were derived from his grant, and hoped

they would not turn them against him;”[v*] a sentiment which, from her

conduct, it is certain that princess had also entertained, and which was

the reigning principle of her courtiers and ministers, and the spring of

all her administration.

 

The commons were in some perplexity. Their eyes were now opened, and they

saw the consequences of that power which had been assumed by the

chancellor, and to which their predecessors had in some instances blindly

submitted. “By this course,” said a member, “the free election of the

counties is taken away, and none shall be chosen but such as shall please

the king and council. Let us therefore with fortitude, understanding, and

sincerity, seek to maintain our privilege. This cannot be construed any

contempt in us, but merely a maintenance of our common rights, which our

ancestors have left us, and which it is just and fit for us to transmit to

our posterity.”[*] Another said, “This may be called a quo warranto to

seize all our liberties.”[**] “A chancellor,” added a third, “by this

course may call a parliament consisting of what persons he pleases. Any

suggestion, by any person, may be the cause of sending a new writ. It is

come to this plain question, whether the chancery or parliament ought to

have authority.”[***]

 

Notwithstanding this watchful spirit of liberty which now appeared in the

commons, their deference for majesty was so great that they appointed a

committee to confer with the judges before the king and council. There the

question of law began to appear in James’s eyes a little more doubtful

than he had hitherto imagined it; and in order to extricate himself with

some honor, he proposed that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set

aside, and a writ be issued, by warrant of the house, for a new election.

Goodwin gave his consent, and the commons embraced the expedient; but in

such a manner that, while they showed their regard for the king, they

secured for the future the free possession of their seats, and the right

which they claimed of judging solely in their own elections and

returns.[****] 45
 

A power like this, so essential to the exercise of all their other powers,

themselves so essential to public liberty, cannot fairly be deemed an

encroachment in the commons; but must be regarded as an inherent

privilege, happily rescued from that ambiguity which the negligence of

some former parliaments had thrown upon it.

 

At the same time, the commons, in the case of Sir Thomas Shirley,

established their power of punishing, as well the persons at whose suit

any member is arrested, as the officers who either arrest or detain him.

Their asserting of this privilege admits of the same reflection.[v]

 

About this period, the minds of men throughout Europe, especially in

England, seem to have undergone a general but insensible revolution.

Though letters had been revived in the preceding age, they were chiefly

cultivated by those of sedentary professions; nor had they till now begun

to spread themselves in any degree among men of the world. Arts, both

mechanical and liberal, were every day receiving great improvements.

Navigation had extended itself over the whole globe. Travelling was secure

and agreeable. And the general system of politics in Europe was become

more enlarged and comprehensive.

 

In consequence of this universal fermentation, the ideas of men enlarged

themselves on all sides; and the several constituent parts of the Gothic

governments, which seem to have lain long inactive, began everywhere to

operate and encroach on each other. On the continent, where the necessity

of discipline had begotten standing armies, the princes commonly

established an unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or intrigue,

the liberties of the people. In England, the love of freedom, which,

unless checked, flourishes extremely in all liberal natures, acquired new

force, and was regulated by more enlarged views, suitable to that

cultivated understanding which became every day more common among men of

birth and education. A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of

antiquity excited in every generous breast a passion for a limited

constitution, and begat an emulation of those manly virtues which the

Greek and Roman authors, by such animating examples, as well as pathetic

expressions, recommend to us. The severe, though popular government of

Elizabeth had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds; but

when a new and a foreign family succeeded to the throne, and a prince less

dreaded and less beloved, symptoms immediately appeared of a more free and

independent genius in the nation.

 

Happily, this prince possessed neither sufficient capacity to perceive the

alteration, nor sufficient art and vigor to check it in its early

advances. Jealous of regal, because conscious of little personal

authority, he had established within his own mind a speculative system of

absolute government, which few of his subjects, he believed, and none but

traitors and rebels, would make any scruple to admit. On whichever side he

cast his eye, every thing concurred to encourage his prejudices. When he

compared himself with the other hereditary sovereigns of Europe, he

imagined that, as he bore the same rank, he was entitled to equal

prerogatives; not considering the innovations lately introduced by them,

and the military force by which their authority was supported. In England,

that power, almost unlimited, which had been exercised for above a

century, especially during the late reign, he ascribed solely to royal

birth and title; not to the prudence and spirit of the monarchs, nor to

the conjunctures of the times. Even the opposition which he had struggled

with in Scotland, encouraged him still further in his favorite notions;

while he there saw, that the same resistance which opposed regal

authority, violated all law and order, and made way either for the ravages

of a barbarous nobility, or for the more intolerable insolence of

seditious preachers. In his own person, therefore, he thought all legal

power to be centred, by an hereditary and a divine right: and this opinion

might have proved dangerous, if not fatal to liberty, had not the firmness

of the persuasion, and its seeming evidence, induced him to trust solely

to his right, without making the smallest provision, either of force or

politics, in order to support it.

 

Such were the opposite dispositions of parliament and prince at the

commencement of the Scottish line; dispositions just beginning to exist

and to appear in the parliament,[*] 46 but thoroughly

established and openly avowed on the part of the prince.

 

The spirit and judgment of the house of commons appeared, not only in

defence of their own privileges, but also in their endeavor, though at

this time in vain, to free trade from those shackles which the high

exerted prerogative, and even, in this respect, the ill-judged tyranny of

Elizabeth, had imposed upon it.

 

James had already, of his own accord, called in and annulled all the

numerous patents for monopolies which had been granted by his predecessor,

and which extremely fettered every species of domestic industry: but the

exclusive companies still remained; another species of monopoly, by which

almost all foreign trade, except that to France, was brought into the

hands of a few rapacious engrossers, and all prospect of future

improvement in commerce was forever sacrificed to a little temporary

advantage of the sovereign. These companies, though arbitrarily erected,

had carried their privileges so far, that almost all the commerce of

England was centred in London; and it appears that the customs of that

port amounted to one hundred and ten thousand pounds a year, while those

of all the kingdom beside yielded only seventeen thousand.[*] Nay, the

whole trade of London was confined to about two hundred citizens,[**] who

were easily enabled, by combining among themselves, to fix whatever price

they pleased both to the exports and imports of the nation. The committee

appointed to consider this enormous grievance, one of the greatest which

we read of in English story, insist on it as a fact well known and avowed,

however contrary to present received opinion, that shipping and seamen had

insensibly decayed during all the preceding reign.[***] And though nothing

be more common than complaints of the decay of trade, even during the most

flourishing periods, yet is this a consequence which might naturally

result from such arbitrary establishments, at a time when the commerce of

all the other nations of Europe, except that of Scotland, enjoyed full

liberty and indulgence.

 

While the commons were thus attempting to give liberty to the trading part

of the nation, they also endeavored to free the landed property from the

burden of wardships,[****] and to remove those remains of the feudal

tenures under which the nation still labored. A just regard was shown to

the crown in the conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy sought for

considered as a matter of right, but merely of grace and favor. The profit

which the king reaped, both from wards and from respite of homage, was

estimated; and it was intended to compound for these prerogatives by a

secure and independent revenue. But after some debates in the house, and

some conferences with the lords, the affair was found to contain more

difficulties than could easily, at that time, be surmounted; and it was

not then brought to any conclusion.

 

The same fate attended an attempt of a like nature, to free the nation

from the burden of purveyance. This prerogative had been much abused by

the purveyors;[v] and the commons showed some intention to offer the king

fifty thousand pounds a year for the abolition of it.

 

Another affair of the utmost consequence was brought before the

parliament, where the commons showed a greater spirit of independence than

any true judgment of national interest. The union of the two kingdoms was

zealously, and even impatiently, urged by the king.[*] He justly regarded

it as the peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated the

bloody animosities of these hostile nations; and had reduced the whole

island under one government, enjoying tranquillity within itself, and

security from all foreign invasions. He hoped that, while his subjects of

both kingdoms reflected on past disasters, besides regarding his person as

infinitely precious, they would entertain the strongest desire of securing

themselves against the return of like calamities, by a thorough union of

laws, parliaments, and privileges. He considered not, that this very

reflection operated, as yet, in a contrary manner on men’s prejudices, and

kept alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which had been carried

to the greatest extremities, and required time to allay it. The more

urgent the king appeared in promoting so useful a measure, the more

backward was the English parliament in concurring with him; while they

ascribed his excessive zeal to that partiality in favor of his ancient

subjects, of which they thought that, on other occasions, they had reason

to complain. Their complaisance for the king, therefore, carried them no

further than to appoint forty-four English to meet with thirty-one

Scottish commissioners, in order to deliberate concerning the terms of a

union; but without any power of making advances towards the establishment

of it.[**]

 

The same spirit of independence, and perhaps not better judgment, appeared

in the house of commons when the question of supply was brought before

them by some members attached to the court. In vain was it urged that,

though the king received a supply which had been voted to Elizabeth, and

which had not been collected before her death, yet he found it burdened

with a debt contracted by the queen, equal to the full amount of it: that

peace was not yet thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland was

still expensive.

 

On his journey from Scotland, amidst such a concourse of people, and on

that of the queen and royal family he had expended considerable sums; and

that, as the courtiers had looked for greater liberalities from the prince

on his accession, and had imposed on his generous nature, so the prince,

in his turn, would expect, at the beginning, some mark of duty and

attachment from his people, and some consideration of his necessities. No

impression was made on the house of commons by these topics; and the

majority appeared fully determined to refuse all supply. The burden of

government, at that time, lay surprisingly light upon the people: and that

very reason, which to us, at this distance, may seem a motive of

generosity, was the real cause why the parliament was, on all occasions,

so remarkably, frugal and reserved. They were not, as yet, accustomed to

open their purses in so liberal a manner as their successors, in order to

supply the wants of their sovereign; and the smallest demand, however

requisite, appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant. The commons

seem also to have been desirous of reducing the crown to still further

necessities, by their refusing a bill, sent down to them by the lords, for

entailing the crown lands forever on the king’s heirs and successors.[*]

The dissipation made by Elizabeth had probably taught James the necessity

of this law, and shown them the advantage of refusing it.

 

In order to cover a disappointment with regard to supply, which might bear

a bad construction both at home and abroad, James sent a message to the

house,[*] in which he told them that he desired no supply; and he was very

forward in refusing what was never offered him.

 

Soon after, he prorogued the parliament, not without discovering in his

speech visible marks of dissatisfaction. Even so early in his reign, he

saw reason to make public complaints of the restless and encroaching

spirit of the Puritanical party, and of the malevolence with which they

endeavored to inspire the commons. Nor were his complaints without

foundation, or the Puritans without interest; since the commons, now

finding themselves free from the arbitrary government of Elizabeth, made

application for a conference with the lords, and presented a petition to

the king; the purport of both which was, to procure in favor of the

Puritans, a relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws.[*] The use of the

surplice, and of the cross in baptism is there chiefly complained of; but

the remedy seems to have been expected solely from the king’s dispensing

power,[**] In the papers which contain this application and petition, we

may also see proofs of the violent animosity of the commons against the

Catholics, together with the intolerating spirit of that assembly.[***] 47
 

This summer, the peace with Spain was finally concluded, and was signed by

the Spanish ministers at London.[****] In the conferences previous to this

treaty, the nations were found to have so few claims on each other, that,

except on account of the support given by England to the Low Country

provinces, the war might appear to have been continued more on account of

personal animosity between Philip and Elizabeth, than any contrariety of

political interests between their subjects. Some articles in the treaty,

which seemed prejudicial to the Dutch commonwealth, were never executed by

the king; and as the Spaniards made no complaints on that head, it

appeared that, by secret agreement, the king had expressly reserved the

power of sending assistance to the Hollanders.[v] The constable of Castile

came into England to ratify the peace; and on the part of England, the

earl of Hertford was sent into the Low Countries for the same purpose, and

the earl of Nottingham, high admiral, into Spain. The train of the latter

was numerous and splendid; and the Spaniards, it is said, were extremely

surprised when they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful

appearance of the English, whom their bigotry, inflamed by the priests,

had represented as so many monsters and infernal demons.

 

Though England, by means of her naval force, was perfectly secure during

the latter years of the Spanish war, James showed an impatience to put an

end to hostilities; and soon after his accession, before any terms of

peace were concerted, or even proposed by Spain, he recalled all the

letters of marque.

 

In this respect, James’s peace was more honorable than that which Henry

IV. himself made with Spain. This latter prince stipulated not to assist

the Dutch; and the supplies which he secretly sent them were in direct

contravention to the treaty.[*] which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth.

Archduke Albert had made some advances of a like nature[**] which invited

the king to take this friendly step. But what is remarkable, in James’s

proclamation for that purpose he plainly supposes, that as he had himself,

while king of Scotland, always lived in amity with Spain, peace was

attached to his person; and that merely by his accession to the crown of

England, without any articles of treaty or agreement, he had ended the war

between the kingdoms.[***] This ignorance of the law of nations may appear

surprising in a prince who was thirty-six years of age, and who had

reigned from his infancy; did we not consider that a king of Scotland, who

lives in close friendship with England, has few transactions to manage

with foreign princes, and has little opportunity of acquiring experience.

Unhappily for James, his timidity, his prejudices, his indolence, his love

of amusement, particularly of hunting, to which he was much addicted, ever

prevented him from making any progress in the knowledge or practice of

foreign politics, and in a little time diminished that regard which all

the neighboring nations had paid to England during the reign of his

predecessor.[****]
