THE noble and free genius of the ancients, which made the government of a

      single person be always regarded as a species of tyranny and usurpation,

      and kept them from forming any conception of a legal and regular monarchy,

      had rendered them entirely ignorant both of the rights of primogeniture

      and a representation in succession; inventions so necessary for preserving

      order in the lines of princes, for obviating the evils of civil discord

      and of usurpation, and for begetting moderation in that species of

      government, by giving security to the ruling sovereign. These innovations

      arose from the feudal law; which, first introducing the right of

      primogeniture, made such a distinction between the families of he elder

      and younger brothers, that the son of the former was thought entitled to

      succeed to his grandfather, preferably to his uncles, though nearer allied

      to the deceased monarch. But though this progress of ideas was natural, it

      was gradual. In the age of which we treat, the practice of representation

      was indeed introduced, but not thoroughly established; and the minds of

      men fluctuated between opposite principles. Richard, when he entered on

      the holy war, declared his nephew Arthur, duke of Brittany, his successor;

      and by a formal deed he set aside, in his favor, the title of his brother

      John, who was younger than Godfrey, the father of that prince.[*]

     

      But John so little acquiesced in that destination that when he gained the

      ascendant in the English ministry by expelling Longchamp, the chancellor

      and great justiciary, he engaged all the English barons to swear that they

      would maintain his right of succession; and Richard, on his return, took

      no steps towards restoring or securing the order which he had at first

      established. He was even careful, by his last will, to declare his brother

      John heir to all his dominions; whether, that he now thought Arthur, who

      was only twelve years of age, incapable of asserting his claim against

      John’s faction, or was influenced by Eleanor, the queen mother, who hated

      Constantia, mother of the young duke, and who dreaded the credit which

      that princess would naturally acquire if her son should mount the throne.

      The authority of a testament was great in that age, even where the

      succession of a kingdom was concerned; and John had reason to hope, that

      this title, joined to his plausible right in other respects, would insure

      him the succession. But the idea of representation seems to have made, at

      this time, greater progress in France than in England; the barons of the

      transmarine provinces Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, immediately declared in

      favor of Arthur’s title, and applied for assistance to the French monarch

      as their superior lord. Philip, who desired only an occasion to embarrass

      John, and dismember his dominions, embraced the cause of the young duke of

      Brittany, took him under his protection, and sent him to Paris to be

      educated along with his own son Lewis. In this emergency, John hastened to

      establish his authority in the chief members of the monarchy; and after

      sending Eleanor into Poictou and Guienne, where her right was

      incontestable, and was readily acknowledged, he hurried to Rouen, and

      having secured the duchy of Normandy, he passed over, without loss of

      time, to England. Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, William Mareschal,

      earl of Strigul, who also passes by the name of earl of Pembroke, and

      Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the justiciary, the three most favored ministers of

      the late king, were already engaged on his side; and the submission or

      acquiescence of all the other barons put him, without opposition, in

      possession of the throne.

     

      The king soon returned to France, in order to conduct the war against

      Philip, and to recover the revolted provinces from his nephew Arthur. The

      alliances which Richard had formed with the earl of Flanders, and other

      potent French princes, though they had not been very effectual, still

      subsisted, and enabled John to defend himself against all the efforts of

      his enemy. In an action between the French and Flemings, the elect bishop

      of Cambray was taken prisoner by the former; and when the cardinal of

      Capua claimed his liberty, Philip, instead of complying, reproached him

      with the weak efforts which he had employed in favor of the bishop of

      Beauvais, who was in a like condition. The legate, to show his

      impartiality, laid at the same time the kingdom of France and the duchy of

      Normandy under an interdict; and the two kings found themselves obliged to

      make an exchange of these military prelates.

     

      1200.

     

      Nothing enabled the king to bring this war to a happy issue so much as the

      selfish, intriguing character of Philip, who acted, in the provinces that

      had declared for Arthur, without any regard to the interests of that

      prince. Constantia, seized with a violent jealousy that he intended to

      usurp the entire dominion of them, found means to carry off her son

      secretly from Paris: she put him into the hands of his uncle; restored the

      provinces which had adhered to the young prince; and made him do homage

      for the duchy of Brittany, which was regarded as a rere-fief of Normandy.

      From this incident, Philip saw that he could not hope to make any progress

      against John; and being threatened with an interdict on account of his

      irregular divorce from Ingelburga, the Danish princess whom he had

      espoused, he became desirous of concluding a peace with England. After

      some fruitless conferences, the terms were at last adjusted; and the two

      monarchy seemed in this treaty to have an intention, besides ending the

      present quarrel, of preventing all future causes of discord, and of

      obviating every controversy which could hereafter arise between them. They

      adjusted the limits of all their territories; mutually secured the

      interests of their vassals, and, to render the union more durable, John

      gave his niece, Blanche of Castile, in marriage to Prince Lewis, Philip’s

      eldest son, and with her the baronies of Issoudun and GraÃ§ai, and other

      fiefs in Berri. Nine barons of the king of England, and as many of the

      king of France, were guaranties of this treaty; and all of them swore,

      that, if their sovereign violated any article of it, they would declare

      themselves against him, and embrace the cause of the injured monarch.

      John, now secure, as he imagined, on the side of France indulged his

      passion for Isabella, the daughter and heir of Aymar Tailleffer, count of

      Angouleme, a lady with whom he had become much enamored. His queen, the

      heiress of the family of Glocester, was still alive: Isabella was married

      to the count de la Marche, and was already consigned to the care of that

      nobleman; though, by reason of her tender years, the marriage had not been

      consummated. The passion of John made him overlook all these obstacles: he

      persuaded the count of Angouleme to carry off his daughter from her

      husband; and having, on some pretence or other, procured a divorce from

      his own wife, he espoused Isabella; regardless both of the menaces of the

      pope, who exclaimed against these irregular proceedings, and of the

      resentment of the injured count, who soon found means of punishing his

      powerful and insolent rival.

     

      1201.

     

      John had not the art of attaching his barons either by affection or by

      fear. The count de la Marche, and his brother, the count d’Eu, taking

      advantage of the general discontent against him, excited commotions in

      Poictou and Normandy, and obliged the king to have recourse to arms, in

      order to suppress the insurrection of his vassals. He summoned together

      the barons of England, and required them to pass the sea under his

      standard, and to quell the rebels: he found that he possessed as little

      authority in that kingdom as in his transmarine provinces. The English

      barons unanimously replied, that they would not attend him on this

      expedition, unless he would promise to restore and preserve their

      privileges; the first symptom of a regular association and plan of liberty

      among those noblemen. But affairs were not yet fully ripe for the

      revolution projected. John, by menacing the barons, broke the concert; and

      both engaged many of them to follow him into Normandy, and obliged the

      rest, who staid behind, to pay him a scutage of two marks on each knight’s

      fee, as the price of their exemption from the service.

     

      The force which John carried abroad with him, and that which joined him in

      Normandy, rendered him much superior to his malecontent barons; and so

      much the more, as Philip did not publicly give them any countenance, and

      seemed as yet determined to persevere steadily in the alliance which he

      had contracted with England. But the king, elated with his superiority,

      advanced claims which gave a universal alarm to his vassals, and diffused

      still wider the general discontent. As the jurisprudence of those times

      required that the causes in the lord’s court should chiefly be decided by

      duel, he carried along with him certain bravos, whom he retained as

      champions, and whom he destined to fight with his barons, in order to

      determine any controversy which he might raise against them. The count de

      la Marche and other noblemen regarded this proceeding as an affront, as

      well as an injury; and declared, that they would never draw their swords

      against men of such inferior quality. The king menaced them with

      vengeance; but he had not vigor to employ against them the force in his

      hands, or to prosecute the injustice, by crushing entirely the nobles who

      opposed it.

     

      This government, equally feeble and violent, gave the injured barons

      courage, as well as inclination, to carry further their opposition: they

      appealed to the king of France; complained of the denial of justice in

      John’s court; demanded redress from him as their superior lord; and

      entreated him to employ his authority, and prevent their final ruin and

      oppression. Philip perceived his advantage, opened his mind to great

      projects, interposed in behalf of the French barons, and began to talk in

      a high and menacing style to the king of England.

     

      1202.

     

      John, who could not disavow Philip’s authority, replied, that it belonged

      to himself first to grant them a trial by their peers in his own court; it

      was not till he failed in this duty, that he was answerable to his peers

      in the supreme court of the French king; and he promised, by a fair and

      equitable judicature, to give satisfaction to his barons. When the nobles,

      in consequence of this engagement, demanded a safe conduct, that they

      might attend his court, he at first refused it: upon the renewal of

      Philip’s menaces, he promised to grant their demand; he violated this

      promise: fresh menaces extorted from him a promise to surrender to Philip

      the fortresses of TillÃ­eres and Boutavant, as a security for performance;

      he again violated this engagement: his enemies, sensible both of his

      weakness and want of faith combined still closer in the resolution of

      pushing him to extremities; and a new and powerful ally soon appeared to

      encourage them in their invasion of this odious and despicable government.

     

      1203.

     

      The young duke of Brittany, who was now rising to man’s estate, sensible

      of the dangerous character of his uncle, determined to seek both his

      security and elevation by a union with Philip and the malecontent barons.

      He joined the French army which had begun hostilities against the king of

      England: he was received with great marks of distinction by Philip; was

      knighted by him; espoused his daughter Mary; and was invested not only in

      the duchy of Brittany, but in the counties of Anjou and Maine, which he

      had formerly resigned to his uncle. Every attempt succeeded with the

      allies. Tillieres and Boutavant were taken by Philip, after making a

      feeble defence: Mortimar and Lyons fell into his hands almost without

      resistance. That prince next invested Gournai; and opening the sluices of

      a lake which lay in the neighborhood, poured such a torrent of water into

      the place, that the garrison deserted it, and the French monarch, without

      striking a blow, made himself master of that important fortress. The

      progress of the French arms was rapid, and promised more considerable

      success than usually in that age attended military enterprises. In answer

      to every advance which the king made towards peace, Philip still insisted

      that he should resign all his transmarine dominions to his nephew and rest

      contented with the kingdom of England; when an event happened, which

      seemed to turn the scales in favor of John, and to give him a decisive

      superiority over his enemies.

     

      Young Arthur, fond of military renown, had broken into Poictou at the head

      of a small army; and passing near Mirebeau, he heard that his grandmother,

      Queen Eleanor, who had always opposed his interests, was lodged in that

      place and was protected by a weak garrison and ruinous fortifications. He

      immediately determined to lay siege to the fortress, and make himself

      master of her person; but John, roused from his indolence by so pressing

      an occasion, collected an army of English and BrabanÃ§ons, and advanced

      from Normandy with hasty marches to the relief of the queen mother. He

      fell on Arthur’s camp, before that prince was aware of the danger;

      dispersed his army; took him prisoner together with the count de la

      Marche, Geoffrey de Lusignan, and the most considerable of the revolted

      barons, and returned in triumph to Normandy. Philip, who was lying before

      Arques, in that duchy, raised the siege and retired upon his approach. The

      greater part of the prisoners were sent over to England, but Arthur was

      shut up in the castle of Falaise.

     

      The king had here a conference with his nephew; represented to him the

      folly of his pretensions; and required him to renounce the French

      alliance, which had encouraged him to live in a state of enmity with all

      his family; but the brave, though imprudent youth, rendered more haughty

      from misfortunes, maintained the justice of his cause; asserted his claim,

      not only to the French provinces, but to the crown of England; and, in his

      turn, required the king to restore the son of his elder brother to the

      possession of his inheritance; John, sensible, from these symptoms of

      spirit, that the young prince, though now a prisoner, might hereafter

      prove a dangerous enemy, determined to prevent all future peril by

      despatching his nephew; and Arthur was never more heard of. The

      circumstances which attended this deed of darkness were, no doubt,

      carefully concealed by the actors, and are variously related by

      historians; but the most probable account is as follows: The king, it is

      said, first proposed to William de la Braye, one of his servants, to

      despatch Arthur; but William replied that he was a gentleman, not a

      hangman; and he positively refused compliance. Another instrument of

      murder was found, and was despatched with proper orders to Falaise; but

      Huber de Bourg, chamberlain to the king, and constable of the castle,

      feigning that he himself would execute the king’s mandate, sent back the

      assassin, spread the report that the young prince was dead, and publicly

      performed all the ceremonies of his interment; but finding that the

      Bretons vowed revenge for the murder, and that all the revolted barons

      persevered more obstinately in their rebellion, he thought it prudent to

      reveal the secret, and to inform the world that the duke of Brittany was

      still alive, and in his custody. This discovery proved fatal to the young

      prince: John first removed him to the castle of Rouen; and coming in a

      boat, during the night time, to that place, commanded Arthur to be brought

      forth to him. The young prince, aware of his danger, and now more subdued

      by the continuance of his misfortunes, and by the approach of death, threw

      himself on his knees before hia uncle, and begged for mercy: but the

      barbarous tyrant, making no reply, stabbed him with his own hands; and

      fastening a stone to the dead body, threw it into the Seine.

     

      All men were struck with horror at this inhuman deed; and from that moment

      the king, detested by his subjects, retained a very precarious authority

      over both the people and the barons in his dominions. The Bretons, enraged

      at this disappointment in their fond hopes, waged implacable war against

      him; and fixing the succession of their government, put themselves in a

      posture to revenge the murder of their sovereign. John had got into his

      power his niece, Eleanor, sister to Arthur, commonly called ‘the damsel of

      Brittany,’ and carrying her over to England, detained her ever after in

      captivity:[*] but the Bretons, in despair of recovering this princess,

      chose Alice for their sovereign; a younger daughter of Constantia, by her

      second marriage with Gui de Thouars; and they intrusted the government of

      the duchy to that nobleman. The states of Brittany meanwhile carried their

      complaints before Philip as their liege lord, and demanded justice for the

      violence committed by John on the person of Arthur, so near a relation,

      who, notwithstanding the homage which he did to Normandy, was always

      regarded as one of the chief vassals of the crown. Philip received their

      application with pleasure; summoned John to stand a trial before him; and

      on his non-appearance, passed sentence, with the concurrence of the peers,

      upon that prince; declared him guilty of felony and parricide; and

      adjudged him to forfeit to his superior lord all his seigniories and fiefs

      in France.[**]

     

      The king of France, whose ambitious and active spirit had been hitherto

      confined, either by the sound policy of Henry, or the martial genius of

      Richard, seeing now the opportunity favorable against this base and odious

      prince, embraced the project of expelling the English, or rather the

      English king, from France, and of annexing to the crown so many

      considerable fiefs, which, during several ages, had been dismembered from

      it. Many of the other great vassals, whose jealousy might have interposed,

      and have obstructed the execution of this project, were not at present in

      a situation to oppose it; and the rest either looked on with indifference

      or gave their assistance to this dangerous aggrandizement of their

      superior lord. The earls of Flanders and Blois were engaged in the holy

      war: the count of Champagne was an infant, and under the guardianship of

      Philip: the duchy of Brittany, enraged at the murder of their prince,

      vigorously promoted all his measures: and the general defection of John’s

      vassals made every enterprise easy and successful against him. Philip,

      after taking several castles and fortresses beyond the Loire, which he

      either garrisoned or dismantled, received the submissions of the count of

      AlenÃ§on, who deserted John, and delivered up all the places under his

      command to the French; upon which Philip broke up his camp, in order to

      give the troops some repose after the fatigues of the campaign. John,

      suddenly collecting some forces, laid siege to AlenÃ§on; and Philip, whose

      dispersed army could not be brought together in time to succor it, saw

      himself exposed to the disgrace of suffering the oppression of his friend

      and confederate. But his active and fertile genius found an expedient

      against this evil. There was held at that very time a tournament at Moret,

      in the Gatinois; whither all the chief nobility of France and the

      neighboring countries had resorted, in order to signalize their prowess

      and address. Philip presented himself before them; craved their assistance

      in his distress; and pointed out the plains of AlenÃ§on, as the most

      honorable field in which they could display their generosity and martial

      spirit. Those valorous knights vowed that they would take vengeance on the

      base parricide, the stain of arms and of chivalry; and putting themselves,

      with all their retinue, under the command of Philip, instantly marched to

      raise the siege of AlenÃ§on. John, hearing of their approach, fled from

      before the place; and in the hurry, abandoned all his tents, machines, and

      baggage to the enemy.

     

      This feeble effort was the last exploit of that slothful and cowardly

      prince for the defence of his dominions. He thenceforth remained in total

      inactivity at Rouen; passing ill his time with his young wife in pastimes

      and amusements, as if his state had been in the most profound

      tranquillity, or his affairs in the most prosperous condition. If he ever

      mentioned war, it was only to give himself vaunting airs, which, in the

      eyes of all men, rendered him still more despicable and ridiculous. “Let

      the French go on,” said he; “I will retake in a day what it has cost them

      years to acquire.”[*] His stupidity and indolence appeared so

      extraordinary that the people endeavored to account for the infatuation by

      sorcery, and believed that he was thrown into this lethargy by some magic

      or witchcraft. The English barons, finding that their time was wasted to

      no purpose, and that they must suffer the disgrace of seeing, without

      resistance, the progress of the French arms, withdrew from their colors,

      and secretly returned to their own country,[**] No one thought of

      defending a man who seemed to have deserted himself; and his subjects

      regarded his fate with the same indifference, to which in this pressing

      exigency, they saw him totally abandoned.

     

      John, while he neglected all domestic resources, had the meanness to

      betake himself to a foreign power, whose protection he claimed: he applied

      to the pope, Innocent III., and entreated him to interpose his authority

      between him and the French monarch. Innocent, pleased with any occasion of

      exerting his superiority, sent Philip orders to stop the progress of his

      arms, and to make peace with the king of England. But the French barons

      received the message with indignation; disclaimed the temporal authority

      assumed by the pontiff; and vowed that they would, to the uttermost,

      assist their prince against all his enemies; Philip, seconding their

      ardor, proceeded, instead of obeying the pope’s envoys, to lay siege to

      Chateau Gaillard, the most considerable fortress which remained to guard

      the frontiers of Normandy.

     

      1204.

     

      Chateau Gaillard was situated partly on an island in the River Seine,

      partly on a rock opposite to it; and was secured by every advantage which

      either art or nature could bestow upon it. The late king, having cast his

      eye on this favorable situation, had spared no labor or expense in

      fortifying it; and it was defended by Roger de Laci, constable of Chester,

      a determined officer, at the head of a numerous garrison. Philip, who

      despaired of taking the place by force proposed to reduce it by famine;

      and that he might cut off its communication with the neighboring country,

      he threw a bridge across the Seine, while he himself, with his army

      blockaded it by land. The earl of Pembroke, the man of greatest vigor and

      capacity in the English court, formed a plan for breaking through the

      French intrenchments, and throwing relief into the place. He carried with

      him an army of four thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry, and

      suddenly attacked, with great success, Philip’s camp in the night time;

      having left orders that a fleet of seventy flat-bottomed vessels should

      sail up the Seine, and fall at the same instant on the bridge. But the

      wind and the current of the river, by retarding the vessels, disconcerted

      this plan of operations; and it was morning before the fleet appeared;

      when Pembroke, though successful in the beginning of the action, was

      already repulsed with considerable loss, and the king of France had

      leisure to defend himself against these new assailants, who also met with

      a repulse. After this misfortune, John made no further efforts for the

      relief of ChÃ¢teau Gaillard: and Philip had all the leisure requisite for

      conducting and finishing the siege. Roger de Laci defended himself for a

      twelvemonth with great obstinacy; and having bravely repelled every

      attack, and patiently borne all the hardships of famine, he was at last

      overpowered by a sudden assault in the night time, and made prisoner of

      war, with his garrison.[*] Philip, who knew how to respect valor, even in

      an enemy, treated him with civility, and gave him the whole city of Paris

      for the place of his confinement.

     

      When this bulwark of Normandy was once subdued, all the province lay open

      to the inroads of Philip; and the king of England despaired of being any

      longer able to defend it. He secretly prepared vessels for a scandalous

      flight; and, that the Normans might no longer doubt of his resolution to

      abandon them, he ordered the fortifications of Pont de l’Arche, Moulineux,

      and Monfort l’Amauri to be demolished. Not daring to repose confidence in

      any of his barons whom he believed to be universally engaged in a

      conspiracy against him, he intrusted the government of the province to

      Arenas Martin and Lupicaire, two mercenary BrabanÃ§ons, whom he had

      retained in his service. Philip, now secure of his prey, pushed his

      conquests with vigor and success against the dismayed Normans. Falaise was

      first besieged; and Lupicare, who commanded in this impregnable fortress,

      after surrendering the place, enlisted himself with his troops in the

      service of Philip, and carried on hostilities against his ancient master.

      Caen, Coutance, Seez, Evreux, Baieux, soon fell into the hands of the

      French monarch, and all the lower Normandy was reduced under his dominion!

      To forward his enterprises on the other division of the province, Gui de

      Thouars, at the head of the Bretons, broke into the territory, and took

      Mount St. Michael, Avranches, and all the other fortresses in that

      neighborhood. The Normans, who abhorred the French yoke and who would have

      defended themselves to the last extremity, if their prince had appeared to

      conduct them, found no resource but in submission; and every city opened

      its gates as soon as Philip appeared before it. Rouen alone, Arques, and

      Verneuil determined to maintain their liberties; and formed a confederacy

      for mutual defence.

     

      1205.

     

      Philip began with the siege of Rouen: the inhabitants were so inflamed

      with hatred to France, that on the appearance of his army, they fell on

      all the natives of that country whom they found within their walls, and

      put tham to death. But after the French king had begun his operations with

      success, and had taken some of their outworks, the citizens, seeing no

      resource, offered to capitulate; and demanded only thirty days to

      advertise their prince of their danger, and to require succors against the

      enemy. Upon the expiration of the term, as no supply had arrived, they

      opened their gates to Philip;[*] and the whole province soon after

      imitated the example, and submitted to the victor. Thus was this important

      territory reunited to the crown of France, about three centuries after the

      cession of it by Charles the Simple to Rollo, the first duke; and the

      Normans, sensible that this conquest was probably final, demanded the

      privilege of being governed by French laws; which Philip, making a few

      alterations on the ancient Norman customs, readily granted them. But the

      French monarch had too much ambition and genius to stop in his present

      career of success. He carried his victorious army into the western

      provinces; soon reduced Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and part of Poictou;[**]

      and in this manner the French crown, during the reign of one able and

      active prince, received such an accession of power and grandeur, as, in

      the ordinary course of things, it would have required several ages to

      attain.

     

      John, on his arrival in England, that he might cover the disgrace of his

      own conduct, exclaimed loudly against his barons, who, he pretended, had

      deserted his standard in Normandy; and he arbitrarily extorted from them a

      seventh of all their movables, as a punishment for the offence.[***]

     

      Soon after he forced them to grant him a scutage of two marks and a half

      on each knights’ fee for an expedition into Normandy; but he did not

      attempt to execute the service for which he pretended to exact it. Next

      year, he summoned all the barons of his realm to attend him on this

      foreign expedition, and collected ships from all the seaports; but meeting

      with opposition from some of his ministers, and abandoning his design, he

      dismissed both fleet and army, and then renewed his exclamations against

      the barons for deserting him. He next put to sea with a small army, and

      his subjects believed that he was resolved to expose himself to the utmost

      hazard for the defence and recovery of his dominions; but they were

      surprised, after a few days, to see him return again into harbor, without

      attempting anything.

     

      1206.

     

      In the subsequent season, he had the courage to carry his hostile measures

      a step farther. Gui de Thouars, who governed Brittany, jealous of the

      rapid progress made by his ally, the French king, promised to join the

      king of England with all his forces; and John ventured abroad with a

      considerable army, and landed at Rochelle. He marched to Angers, which he

      took and reduced to ashes. But the approach of Philip with an army threw

      him into a panic; and he immediately made proposals for peace, and fixed a

      place of interview with his enemy; but instead of keeping this engagement,

      he stole off with his army, embarked at Rochelle, and returned, loaded

      with new shame and disgrace, into England. The mediation of the pope

      procured him at last a truce for two years with the French monarch;[*]

      almost all the transmarine provinces were ravished from him; and his

      English barons, though harassed with arbitrary taxes and fruitless

      expeditions, saw themselves and their country baffled and affronted in

      every enterprise.

     

      In an age when personal valor was regarded as the chief accomplishment,

      such conduct as that of John, always disgraceful, must be exposed to

      peculiar contempt; and he must thenceforth have expected to rule his

      turbulent vassals with a very doubtful authority. But the government

      exercised by the Norman princes had wound up the royal power to so high a

      pitch, and so much beyond the usual tenor of the feudal constitutions,

      that it still behoved him to be debased by new affronts and disgraces, ere

      his barons could entertain the view of conspiring against him in order to

      retrench his prerogatives.

     

      The church, which at that time declined not a contest with the most

      powerful and most vigorous monarchs, took first advantage of John’s

      imbecility; and, with the most aggravating circumstances of insolence and

      scorn, fixed her yoke upon him.

     

      1207.

     

      The papal chair was then filled by Innocent III., who, having attained

      that dignity at the age of thirty-seven years, and being endowed with a

      lofty and enterprising genius gave full scope to his ambition, and

      attempted, perhaps more openly than any of his predecessors, to convert

      that superiority which was yielded him by all the European princes, into a

      real dominion over them. The hierarchy, protected by the Roman pontiff,

      had already carried to an enormous height its usurpations upon the civil

      power; but in order to extend them farther, and render them useful to the

      court of Rome, it was necessary to reduce the ecclesiastics themselves

      under an absolute monarchy, and to make them entirely dependent on their

      spiritual leader. For this purpose, Innocent first attempted to impose

      taxes at pleasure upon the clergy; and in the first year of this century,

      taking advantage of the popular frenzy for crusades, he sent collectors

      over all Europe, who levied by his authority the fortieth of all

      ecclesiastical revenues for the relief of the Holy Land, and received the

      voluntary contributions of the laity to a like amount.[*] The same year,

      Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, attempted another innovation, favorable

      to ecclesiastical and papal power: in the king’s absence, he summoned, by

      his legantine authority, a synod of all the English clergy, contrary to

      the inhibition of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the chief justiciary; and no proper

      censure was ever passed on this encroachment, the first of the kind, upon

      the royal power. But a favorable incident soon after happened, which

      enabled so aspiring a pontiff as Innocent to extend still farther his

      usurpations on so contemptible a prince as John.

     

      Hubert, the primate, died in 1205; and as the monks or canons of

      Christ-church, Canterbury, possessed a right of voting in the election of

      their archbishop, some of the juniors of the order, who lay in wait for

      that event, met clandestinely the very night of Hubert’s death; and

      without any congÃ© d‘Ã©lire from the king, chose Reginald, their sub-prior,

      for the successor; installed him in the archiepiscopal throne before

      midnight; and having enjoined him the strictest secrecy, sent him

      immediately to Rome, in order to solicit the confirmation of his

      election.[*] The vanity of Reginald prevailed over his prudence; and he no

      sooner arrived in Flanders than he revealed to every one the purpose of

      his journey, which was immediately known in England.[**] The king was

      enraged at the novelty and temerity of the attempt, in filling so

      important an office without his knowledge or consent: the suffragan

      bishops of Canterbury, who were accustomed to concur in the choice of

      their primate, were no less displeased at the exclusion given them in this

      election: the senior monks of Christ-church were injured by the irregular

      proceedings of their juniors: the juniors themselves, ashamed of their

      conduct, and disgusted with the levity of Reginald, who had broken his

      engagements with them, were willing to set aside his election:[***] and

      all men concurred in the design of remedying the false measures which had

      been taken. But as John knew that this affair would be canvassed before a

      superior tribunal, where the interposition of royal authority in bestowing

      ecclesiastical benefices was very invidious; where even the cause of

      suffragan bishops was not so favorable as that of monks; he determined to

      make the new election entirely unexceptionable, he submitted the affair

      wholly to the canons of Christ-church; and departing from the right

      claimed by his predecessors, ventured no farther than to inform them,

      privately, that they would do him an acceptable service if they chose John

      de Gray, bishop of Norwich, for their primate.[****]

     

      The election of that prelate was accordingly made without a contradictory

      vote; and the king, to obviate all contests, endeavored to persuade the

      suffragan bishops not to insist on their claim of concurring in the

      election; but those prelates, persevering in their pretensions, sent an

      agent to maintain their cause before Innocent; while the king, and the

      convent of Christ-church, despatched twelve monks of that order to

      support, before the same tribunal, the election of the bishop of Norwich.

     

      Thus there lay three different claims before the pope, whom all parties

      allowed to be the supreme arbiter in the contest The claim of the

      suffragans, being so opposite to the usual maxims of the papal court, was

      soon set aside: the election of Reginald was so obviously fraudulent and

      irregular, that there was no possibility of defending it: but Innocent

      maintained, that though this election was null and invalid, it ought

      previously to have been declared such by the sovereign pontiff, before the

      monks could proceed to a new election; and that the choice of the bishop

      of Norwich was of course as uncanonical as that of his competitor.[*]

      Advantage was, therefore taken of this subtlety for introducing a

      precedent, by which the see of Canterbury, the most important dignity, in

      the church after the papal throne, should ever after be at the disposal of

      the court of Rome.

     

      While the pope maintained so many fierce contests, in order to wrest from

      princes the right of granting investitures, and to exclude laymen from all

      authority in conferring ecclesiastical benefices, he was supported by the

      united influence of the clergy; who, aspiring to independence, fought,

      with all the ardor of ambition, and all the zeal of superstition, under

      his sacred banners. But no sooner was this point, after a great effusion

      of blood, and the convulsions of many states, established in some

      tolerable degree, than the victorious leader as is usual, turned his arms

      against his own community, and aspired to centre all power in his person.

      By the invention of reserves, provisions, commendams, and other devices,

      the pope gradually assumed the right of filling vacant benefices; and the

      plenitude of his apostolic power, which was not subject to any

      limitations, supplied all defects of title in the person on whom he

      bestowed preferment. The canons which regulated elections were purposely

      rendered intricate and involved: frequent disputes arose among candidates:

      appeals were every day carried to Rome: the apostolic see, besides reaping

      pecuniary advantages from these contests, often exercised the power of

      setting aside both the litigants, and, on pretence of appeasing faction,

      nominated a third person, who might be more acceptable to the contending

      parties.

     

      The present controversy about the election to the see of Canterbury

      afforded Innocent an opportunity of claiming this right; and he failed not

      to perceive and avail himself of the advantage. He sent for the twelve

      monks deputed by the convent to maintain the cause of the bishop of

      Norwich; and commanded them, under the penalty of excommunication, to

      choose for their primate, Cardinal Langton, an Englishman by birth, but

      educated in France, and connected, by his interests and attachments, with

      the see of Rome.[**]

     

      In vain did the monks represent, that they had received from their convent

      no authority for this purpose; that an election without a previous writ

      from the king, would be deemed highly irregular and that they were merely

      agents for another person, whose right they had no power or pretence to

      abandon. None of them had the courage to persevere in this opposition,

      except one, Elias de Brantefield: all the rest, overcome by the menaces

      and authority of the pope, complied with his orders, and made the election

      required of them.

     

      Innocent, sensible that this flagrant usurpation would be highly resented

      by the court of England, wrote John a mollifying letter; sent him four

      golden rings set with precious stones; and endeavored to enhance the value

      of the present, by informing him of the many mysteries implied in it. He

      begged him to consider seriously the form of the rings, their number,

      their matter, and their color. Their form, he said, being round, shadowed

      out eternity, which had neither beginning nor end; and he ought thence to

      learn his duty of aspiring from earthly objects to heavenly, from things

      temporal to tilings eternal. The number four, being a square, denoted

      steadiness of mind, not to be subverted either by adversity or prosperity,

      fixed forever on the firm basis of the four cardinal virtues. Gold, which

      is the matter, being the most precious of metals, signified wisdom, which

      is the most valuable of all accomplishments, and justly preferred by

      Solomon to riches, power, and all exterior attainments. The blue color of

      the sapphire represented faith; the verdure of the emerald, hope; the

      redness of the ruby, charity; and the splendor of the topaz, good

      works.[*] By these conceits, Innocent endeavored to repay John for one of

      the most important prerogatives of his crown, which he had ravished from

      him; conceits probably admired by Innocent himself. For it is easily

      possible for a man, especially in a barbarous age, to unite strong talents

      for business with an absurd taste for literature and the arts.

     

      John was inflamed with the utmost rage when he heard of this attempt of

      the court of Rome;[**] and he immediately vented his passion on the monks

      of Christ-church, whom he found inclined to support the election made by

      their fellows at Rome.

     

      He sent Fulk de Cantelupe, and Henry de Cornhulle, two knights of his

      retinue, men of violent tempers and rude manners, to expel them the

      convent, and take possession of their revenues. These knights entered the

      monastery with drawn swords, commanded the prior and the monks to depart

      the kingdom, and menaced them, that in case of disobedience they would

      instantly burn them with the convent.[*] Innocent, prognosticating, from

      the violence and imprudence of these measures, that John would finally

      sink in the contest, persevered the more vigorously in his pretensions,

      and exhorted the king not to oppose God and the church any longer, nor to

      persecute that cause for which the holy martyr St. Thomas had sacrificed

      his life, and which had exalted him equal to the highest saints in

      heaven;[**] a clear hint to John to profit by the example of his father,

      and to remember the prejudices and established principles of his subjects,

      who bore a profound veneration to that martyr, and regarded his merits as

      the subject of their chief glory and exultation.

     

      Innocent, finding that John was not sufficiently tamed to submission, sent

      three prelates, the bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester, to intimate,

      that, if he persevered in his disobedience, the sovereign pontiff would be

      obliged to lay the kingdom under an interdict.[***] All the other prelates

      threw themselves on their knees before him, and entreated him, with tears

      in their eyes, to prevent the scandal of this sentence, by making a speedy

      submission to his spiritual father, by receiving from his hands the new

      elected primate, and by restoring the monks of Christ-church to all their

      rights and possessions. He burst out into the most indecent invectives

      against the prelates; swore by God’s teeth, his usual oath, that, if the

      pope presumed to lay his kingdom under an interdict, he would send to him

      all the bishops and clergy of England, and would confiscate all their

      estates; and threatened that, if thenceforth he caught any Romans in his

      dominions, he would put out their eyes, and cut off their noses, in order

      to set a mark upon them, which might distinguish them from all other

      nations.[****]

     

      Amidst all this idle violence, John stood on such bad terms with his

      nobility, that he never dared to assemble the states of the kingdom, who,

      in so, just a cause, would probably have adhered to any other monarch, and

      have defended with vigor the liberties of the nation against these

      palpable usurpations of the court of Rome. Innocent, therefore, perceiving

      the king’s weakness, fulminated at last the sentence of interdict which he

      had for some time held suspended over him.[*]

     

      The sentence of interdict was at that time the great instrument of

      vengeance and policy employed by the court of Rome; was denounced against

      sovereigns for the lightest offences; and made the guilt of one person

      involve the ruin of millions, even in their spiritual and eternal welfare.

      The execution of it was calculated to strike the senses in the highest

      degree, and to operate with irresistible force on the superstitious minds

      of the people. The nation was of a sudden deprived of all exterior

      exercise of its religion: the altars were despoiled of their ornaments:

      the crosses, the relics, the images, the statues of the saints were laid

      on the ground; and as if the air itself were profaned, and might pollute

      them by its contact, the priests carefully covered them up, even from

      their own approach and veneration. The use of bells entirely ceased in all

      the churches: the bells themselves were removed from the steeples, and

      laid on the ground with the other sacred utensils. Mass was celebrated

      with shut doors; and none but the priests were admitted to that holy

      institution. The laity partook of no religious rite, except baptism to

      new-born infants, and the communion to the dying: the dead were not

      interred in consecrated ground: they were thrown into ditches, or buried

      in common fields; and their obsequies were not attended with prayers or

      any hallowed ceremony Marriage was celebrated in the churchyards;[**] and

      that every action in life might bear the marks of this dreadful situation,

      the people were prohibited the use of meat, as in Lent, or times of the

      highest penance; were debarred from all pleasures and entertainments; and

      were forbidden even to salute each other, or so much as to shave their

      beards, and give any decent attention to their person and apparel. Every

      circumstance carried symptoms of the deepest distress, and of the most

      immediate apprehension of divine vengeance and indignation.

     

      The king, that he might oppose the temporal to their spiritual terrors,

      immediately, from his own authority, confiscated the estates of all the

      clergy who obeyed the interdict;[***] banished the prelates, confined the

      monks in their convents, and gave them only such a small allowance from

      their own estates, as would suffice to provide them with food and raiment.

     

      He treated with the utmost rigor all Langton’s adherents, and every one

      that showed any disposition to obey the commands of Rome: and in order to

      distress the clergy in the tenderest point, and at the same time expose

      them to reproach and ridicule, he threw into prison all their concubines,

      and required high fines as the price of their liberty.[*]

     

      After the canons which established the celibacy of the clergy were, by the

      zealous endeavors of Archbishop Anselrn, more rigorously executed in

      England, the ecclesiastics gave, almost universally and avowedly, into the

      use of concubinage and the court of Rome, which had no interest in

      prohibiting this practice, made very slight opposition to it. The custom

      was become so prevalent, that, in some cantons of Switzerland, before the

      reformation, the laws not only permitted, but, to avoid scandal, enjoined

      the use of concubines to the younger clergy;[**] and it was usual every

      where for priests to apply to the ordinary, and obtain from him a formal

      liberty for this indulgence. The bishop commonly took care to prevent the

      practice from degenerating into licentiousness: he confined the priest to

      the use of one woman, required him to be constant to her bed, obliged him

      to provide for her subsistence and that of her children; and, though the

      offspring was, in the eye of the law, deemed illegitimate, this commerce

      was really a kind of inferior marriage, such as is still practised in

      Germany among the nobles; and may be regarded by the candid, as an appeal

      from the tyranny of civil and ecclesiastical institutions, to the more

      virtuous and more unerring laws of nature.

     

      The quarrel between the king and the see of Rome continued for some years;

      and though many of the clergy, from the fear of punishment, obeyed the

      orders of John, and celebrated divine service, they complied with the

      utmost reluctance, and were regarded, both by themselves and the people,

      as men who betrayed their principles, and sacrificed their conscience to

      temporal regards and interests. During this violent situation, the king,

      in order to give a lustre to his government, attempted military

      expeditions against Scotland, against Ireland, against the Welsh:[*] and

      he commonly prevailed, more from the weakness of his enemies than from his

      own vigor or abilities. Meanwhile, the danger to which hia government

      stood continually exposed from the discontents of the ecclesiastics,

      increased his natural propension to tyranny; and he seems to have even

      wantonly disgusted all orders of men, especially his nobles, from whom

      alone he could reasonably expect support and assistance. He dishonored

      their families by his licentious amours; he published edicts, prohibiting

      them from hunting feathered game, and thereby restrained them from their

      favorite occupation and amusement;[**] he ordered all the hedges and

      fences near his forests to be levelled, that his deer might have more

      ready access into the fields for pasture; and he continually loaded the

      nation with arbitrary impositions.

     

      1208.

     

      Conscious of the general hatred which he had incurred, he required his

      nobility to give him hostages for security of their allegiance; and they

      were obliged to put in his hands their sons, nephews, or near relations.

      When his messengers came with like orders to the castle of William de

      Braouse, a baron of great note, the lady of that nobleman replied, that

      she would never intrust her son into the hands of one who had murdered his

      own nephew, while in his custody. Her husband reproved her for the

      severity of this speech; but, sensible of his danger, he immediately fled

      with his wife and son into Ireland, where he endeavored to conceal

      himself. Tha king discovered the unhappy family in their retreat; seized

      the wife and son, whom he starved to death in prison; and the baron

      himself narrowly escaped, by flying into France.

     

      1209.

     

      The court of Rome had artfully contrived a gradation of sentences; by

      which it kept offenders in awe; still afforded them an opportunity of

      preventing the next anathema by submission; and, in case of their

      obstinacy, was able to refresh the horror of the people against them, by

      new denunciations of the wrath and vengeance of Heaven. As the sentence of

      interdict had not produced the desired effect on John, and as his people,

      though extremely discontented had hitherto been restrained from rising in

      open rebellion against him, he was soon to look for the sentence of

      excommunication; and he had reason to apprehend, that, notwithstanding all

      his precautions, the most dangerous consequences might ensue from it. He

      was witness of the other scenes which at that very time were acting in

      Europe, and which displayed the unbounded and uncontrolled power of the

      papacy. Innocent, far from being dismayed at his contests with the king of

      England, had excommunicated the emperor Otho, John’s nephew;[*] and soon

      brought that powerful and haughty prince to submit to his authority. He

      published a crusade against the Albigenses, a species of enthusiasts in

      the south of France, whom he denominated heretics; because, like other

      enthusiasts, they neglected the rites of the church, and opposed the power

      and influence of the clergy: the people from all parts of Europe, moved by

      their superstition and their passion for wars and adventures, flocked to

      his standard: Simon de Montfort, the general of the crusade, acquired to

      himself a sovereignty in these provinces: the count of Toulouse, who

      protected, or perhaps only tolerated, the Albigenses, was stripped of his

      dominions: and these sectaries themselves, though the most innocent and

      inoffensive of mankind, were exterminated with all the circumstances of

      extreme violence and barbarity. Here were therefore both an army and a

      general, dangerous from their zeal and valor, who might be directed to act

      against John; and Innocent, after keeping the thunder long suspended, gave

      at last authority to the bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester, to

      fulminate the sentence of excommunication against him.[**] These prelates

      obeyed; though their brethren were deterred from publishing, as the pope

      required of them, the sentence in the several churches of their dioceses.

     

      No sooner was the excommunication known, than the effects of it appeared.

      Geoffrey, archdeacon of Norwich, who was intrusted with a considerable

      office in the court of exchequer, being informed of it while sitting on

      the bench observed to his colleagues the danger of serving under an

      excommunicated king; and he immediately left his chair, and departed the

      court. John gave orders to seize him, to throw him into prison, to cover

      his head with a great leaden cope, and by this and other severe usage, he

      soon put an end to his life:[***] nor was there any thing wanting to

      Geoffrey, except the dignity and rank of Becket, to exalt him to an equal

      station in heaven with that great and celebrated martyr.

     

      Hugh de Wells, the chancellor, being elected by the king’s appointment

      bishop of Lincoln, upon a vacancy in that see, desired leave to go abroad,

      in order to receive consecration from the archbishop of Rouen; but he no

      sooner reached France, than he hastened to Pontigny, where Langton then

      resided, and paid submissions to him as his primate. The bishops, finding

      themselves exposed either to the jealousy of the king or hatred of the

      people, gradually stole out of the kingdom; and at last there remained

      only three prelates to perform the functions of the episcopal office.[*]

      Many of the nobility, terrified by John’s tyranny, and obnoxious to him on

      different accounts, imitated the example of the bishops; and most of the

      others, who remained, were with reason suspected of having secretly

      entered into a confederacy against him.[**] John was alarmed at his

      dangerous situation; a situation which prudence, vigor, and popularity

      might formerly have prevented, but which no virtues or abilities were now

      sufficient to retrieve. He desired a conference with Langton at Dover;

      offered to acknowledge him as primate, to submit to the pope, to restore

      the exiled clergy, even to pay them a limited sum as a compensation for

      the rents of their confiscated estates. But Langton, perceiving his

      advantage, was not satisfied with these concessions: he demanded that full

      restitution and reparation should be made to all the clergy; a condition

      so exorbitant, that the king, who probably had not the power of fulfilling

      it, and who foresaw that this estimation of damages might amount to an

      immense sum, finally broke off the conference.[***]

     

      1212.

     

      The next gradation of papal sentences was to absolve John’s subjects from

      their oaths of fidelity and allegiance, and to declare every one

      excommunicated who had any commerce with him, in public or in private; at

      his table, in his council, or even in private conversation:[****] and this

      sentence was accordingly, with all imaginable solemnity, pronounced

      against him. But as John still persevered in his contumacy, there remained

      nothing but the sentence of deposition; which, though intimately connected

      with the former had been distinguished from it by the artifice of the

      court of Rome; and Innocent determined to dart this last thunderbolt

      against the refractory monarch.

     

      But as a sentence of this kind required an armed force to execute it, the

      pontiff, casting his eyes around, fixed at last on Philip, king of France,

      as the person into whose powerful hand he could most properly intrust that

      weapon, the ultimate resource of his ghostly authority. And he offered the

      monarch, besides the remission of all his sins, and endless spiritual

      benefits, the property and possession of the kingdom of England, as the

      reward of his labor.[*]

     

      1213.

     

      It was the common concern of all princes to oppose these exorbitant

      pretensions of the Roman pontiff, by which they themselves were rendered

      vassals, and vassals totally dependent, of the papal crown: yet even

      Philip, the most able monarch of the age, was seduced by present interest,

      and by the prospect of so tempting a prize, to accept this liberal offer

      of the pontiff, and thereby to ratify that authority which, if he ever

      opposed its boundless usurpations, might next day tumble him from the

      throne. He levied a great army; summoned all the vassals of the crown to

      attend him at Rouen; collected a fleet of one thousand seven hundred

      vessels, great and small, in the seaports of Normandy and Picardy; and

      partly from the zealous spirit of the age, partly from the personal regard

      universally paid him, prepared a force which seemed equal to the greatness

      of his enterprise. The king, on the other hand, issued out writs,

      requiring the attendance of all his military tenants at Dover, and even of

      all able-bodied men, to defend the kingdom in this dangerous extremity. A

      great number appeared; and he selected an army of sixty thousand men; a

      power invincible, had they been united in affection to their prince, and

      animated with a becoming zeal for the defence of their native country.[**]

     

      But the people were swayed by superstition, and regarded their king with

      horror, as anathematized by papal censures: the barons, besides lying

      under the same prejudices, were all disgusted by his tyranny, and were,

      many of them, suspected of holding a secret correspondence with the enemy:

      and the incapacity and cowardice of the king himself, ill fitted to

      contend with those mighty difficulties, made men prognosticate the most

      fatal effects from the French invasion.

     

      Pandolf, whom the pope had chosen for his legate, and appointed to head

      this important expedition, had, before he left Rome, applied for a secret

      conference with his master, and had asked him, whether, if the king of

      England, in this desperate situation, were willing to submit to the

      apostolic see, the church should, without the consent of Philip, grant him

      any terms of accommodation.[*] Innocent, expecting from his agreement with

      a prince so abject both in character and fortune, more advantages than

      from his alliance with a great and victorious monarch, who, after such

      mighty acquisitions, might become too haughty to be bound by spiritual

      chains, explained to Pandolf the conditions on which he was willing to be

      reconciled to the king of England. The legate, therefore, as soon as he

      arrived in the north of France, sent over two knights templars to desire

      an interview with John at Dover, which was readily granted: he there

      represented to him in such strong, and probably in such true colors, his

      lost condition, the disaffection of his subjects, the secret combination

      of his vassals against him, the mighty armament of France, that John

      yielded at discretion,[**] and subscribed to all the conditions which

      Pandolf was pleased to impose upon him. He promised, among other articles,

      that he would submit himself entirely to the judgment of the pope; that he

      would acknowledge Langton for primate; that he would restore all the

      exiled clergy and laity who had been banished on account of the contest;

      that he would make them full restitution of their goods, and compensation

      for all damages, and instantly consign eight thousand pounds, in part of

      payment; and that every one outlawed or imprisoned for his adherence to

      the pope, should immediately be received into grace and favor.[***] Four

      barons swore, along with the king, to the observance of this ignominious

      treaty.[****]

     

      But the ignominy of the king was not yet carried to its full height.

      Pandolf required him, as the first trial of obedience, to resign his

      kingdom to the church; and he persuaded him, that he could nowise so

      effectually disappoint the French invasion, as by thus putting himself

      under the immediate protection of the apostolic see. John, lying under the

      agonies of present terror, made no scruple of submitting to this condition

      He passed a charter, in which he said, that, not constrained by fear, but

      of his own free will, and by the common advice and consent of his barons,

      he had, for remission of hia own sins and those of his family, resigned

      England and Ireland to God, to St. Peter and St. Paul, and to Pope

      Innocent and his successors in the apostolic chair: he agreed to hold

      these dominions as feudatory of the church of Rome, by the annual payment

      of a thousand marks; seven hundred for England, three hundred for Ireland:

      and he stipulated, that, if he or his successors should ever presume to

      revoke or infringe this charter, they should instantly, except upon

      admonition they repented of their offence, forfeit all right to their

      dominions.[*]

     

      In consequence of this agreement, John did homage to Pandolf as the pope’s

      legate, with all the submissive rites which the feudal law required of

      vassals before their liege lord and superior. He came disarmed into the

      legate’s presence, who was seated on a throne; he flung himself on his

      knees before him; he lifted up his joined hands, and put them within those

      of Pandolf; he swore fealty to the pope; and he paid part of the tribute

      which he owed for his kingdom as the patrimony of St. Peter. The legate,

      elated by this supreme triumph of sacerdotal power, could not forbear

      discovering extravagant symptoms of joy and exultation: he trampled on the

      money, which was laid at his feet as an earnest of the subjection of the

      kingdom; an insolence of which, however offensive to all the English, no

      one present, except the archbishop of Dublin, dared to take any notice.

      But though Pandolf had brought the king to submit to these base

      conditions, he still refused to free him from the excommunication and

      interdict, till an estimation should be taken of the losses of the

      ecclesiastics, and full compensation and restitution should be made them.

     

      John, reduced to this abject situation under a foreign power, still showed

      the same disposition to tyrannize over his subjects, which had been the

      chief cause of all his misfortunes. One Peter of Pomfret, a hermit, had

      foretold that the king, this very year, should lose his crown; and for

      that rash prophecy, he had been thrown into prison in Corfe castle. Johfi

      now determined to bring him to punishment as an impostor; and though the

      man pleaded that his prophecy was fulfilled, and that the king had lost

      the royal and independent crown which he formerly wore, the defence was

      supposed to aggravate his guilt: he was dragged at horses’ tails to the

      town of Warham, and there hanged on a gibbet with his son.[*]

     

      When Pandolf, after receiving the homage of John, returned to France, he

      congratulated Philip on the success of his pious enterprise; and informed

      him that John, moved by the terror of the French arms, had now come to a

      just sense of his guilt; had returned to obedience under the apostolic

      see; had even consented to do homage to the pope for his dominions; and

      having thus made his kingdom a part of St. Peter’s patrimony, had rendered

      it impossible for any Christian prince, without the most manifest and most

      flagrant impiety, to attack him.[**] Philip was enraged on receiving this

      intelligence: he exclaimed, that having, at the pope’s instigation,

      undertaken an expedition which had cost him above sixty thousand pounds

      sterling, he was frustrated of his purpose, at the time when its success

      was become infallible: he complained that all the expense had fallen upon

      him; all the advantages had accrued to Innocent: he threatened to be no

      longer the dupe of these hypocritical pretences: and assembling his

      vassals, he laid before them the ill treatment which he had received,

      exposed the interested and fraudulent conduct of the pope, and required

      their assistance to execute his enterprise against England, in which he

      told them, that notwithstanding the inhibitions and menaces of the legate,

      he was determined to persevere. The French barons were in that age little

      less ignorant and superstitious than the English: yet, so much does the

      influence of those religious principles depend on the present dispositions

      of men! they all vowed to follow their prince on his intended expedition,

      and were resolute not to be disappointed of that glory and those riches

      which they had long expected from this enterprise. The earl of Flanders

      alone, who had previously formed a secret treaty with John, declaring

      against the injustice and impiety of the undertaking, retired with his

      forces;[***] and Philip, that he might not leave so dangerous an enemy

      behind him, first turned his arms against the dominions of that prince.

     

      Meanwhile the English fleet was assembled under the earl of Saltsbury, the

      king’s natural brother; and, though inferior in number, received orders to

      attack the French in their harbors. Salisbury performed this service with

      so much success that he took three hundred ships; destroyed a hundred

      more;[*] and Philip, finding it impossible to prevent the rest from

      falling into the hands of the enemy, set fire to them himself, and thereby

      rendered it impossible for him to proceed any farther in his enterprise.

     

      John, exulting in his present security, insensible to his past disgrace,

      was so elated with this success, that he thought of no less than invading

      France in his turn, and recovering all those provinces which the

      prosperous arms of Philip had formerly ravished from him. He proposed this

      expedition to the barons, who were already assembled for the defence of

      the kingdom. But the English nobles both hated and despised their prince:

      they prognosticated no success to any enterprise conducted by a such a

      leader: and, pretending that their time of service was elapsed, and all

      their previsions exhausted, they refused to second his undertaking.[**]

      The king, however, resolute in his purpose, embarked with a few followers,

      and sailed to Jersey, in the foolish expectation that the barons would at

      last be ashamed to stay behind.[***] But finding himself disappointed, he

      returned to England; and raising some troops, threatened to take vengeance

      on all his nobles for their desertion and disobedience. The archbishop of

      Canterbury, who was in a confederacy with the barons here interposed;

      strictly inhibited the king from thinking of such an attempt; and

      threatened him with a renewal of the sentence of excommunication if he

      pretended to levy war upon any of his subjects before the kingdom were

      freed from the sentence of interdict.[****]

     

      The church had recalled the several anathemas pronounced against John, by

      the same gradual progress with which she had at first issued them. By

      receiving his homage, and admitting him to the rank of a vassal, his

      deposition had been virtually annulled, and his subjects were again bound

      by their oaths of allegiance. The exiled prelates had then returned in

      great triumph, with Langton at their head; and the king, hearing of their

      approach, went forth to meet them, and throwing himself on the ground

      before them, he entreated them with tears to have compassion on him and

      the kingdom of England.[*] The primate, seeing these marks of sincere

      penitence, led him to the chapter-house of Winchester, and there

      administered an oath to him, by which he again swore fealty and obedience

      to Pope Innocent and his successors; promised to love, maintain, and

      defend holy church and the clergy; engaged that he would reestablish the

      good laws of his predecessors, particularly those of St. Edward, and would

      abolish the wicked ones; and expressed his resolution of maintaining

      justice and right in all his dominions.[**] The primate next gave him

      absolution in the requisite forms, and admitted him to dine with him, to

      the great joy of all the people. The sentence of interdict, however, was

      still upheld against the kingdom. A new legate, Nicholas, bishop of

      Frescati, came into England in the room of Pandolf; and he declared it to

      be the pope’s intentions never to loosen that sentence till full

      restitution were made to the clergy of every thing taken from them, and

      ample reparation for all damages which they had Sustained. He only

      permitted mass to be said with a low voice in the churches, till those

      losses and damages could be estimated to the satisfaction of the parties.

      Certain barons were appointed to take an account of the claims; and John

      was astonished at the greatness of the sums to which the clergy made their

      losses to amount. No less than twenty thousand marks were demanded by the

      monks of Canterbury alone; twenty-three thousand for the see of Lincoln;

      and the king, finding these pretensions to be exorbitant and endless,

      offered the clergy the sum of a hundred thousand marks for a final

      acquittal, The clergy rejected the offer with disdain; but the pope,

      willing to favor his new vassal, whom he found zealous in his declarations

      of fealty, and regular in paying the stipulated tribute to Rome, directed

      his legate to accept of forty thousand. The issue of the whole was, that

      the bishops and considerable abbots got reparation beyond what they had

      any title to demand; the inferior clergy were obliged to sit down

      contented with their losses: and the king, after the interdict was taken

      off, renewed, in the most solemn manner, and by a new charter sealed with

      gold, his professions of homage and obedience to the see of Rome.

     

      1214.

     

      When this vexatious affair was at last brought to a conclusion, the king,

      as if he had nothing further to attend but triumphs and victories, went

      over to Poictou, which still acknowledged his authority;[*] and he carried

      war into Philip’s dominions.

     

      He besieged a castle near Angiers; but the approach of Prince Lewis,

      Philip’s son, obliged him to raise the siege with such precipitation, that

      he left his tents, machines, and baggage behind him; and he returned to

      England with disgrace. About the same time, he heard of the great and

      decisive victory gained by the king of France at Bovines over the emperor

      Otho, who had entered France at the head of one hundred and fifty thousand

      Germans; a victory which established forever the glory of Philip, and gave

      full security to all his dominions. John could, therefore, think

      henceforth of nothing further than of ruling peaceably his own kingdom;

      and his close connections with the pope, which he was determined at any

      price to maintain, insured him, as he imagined the certain attainment of

      that object. But the last and most grievous scene of this prince’s

      misfortunes still awaited him; and he was destined to pass through a

      series of more humiliating circumstances than had ever yet fallen to the

      lot of any other monarch.

     

      The introduction of the feudal law into England by William the Conqueror

      had much infringed the liberties, however imperfect, enjoyed by the

      Anglo-Saxons in their ancient government, and had reduced the whole people

      to a state of vassalage under the king or barons, and even the greater

      part of them to a state of real slavery, the necessity, also, of

      intrusting great power in the hands of a prince, who was to maintain

      military dominion over a vanquished nation, had engaged the Norman barons

      to submit to a more severe and absolute prerogative than that to which men

      of their rank, in other feudal governments, were commonly subjected. The

      power of the crown, once raised to a high pitch, was not easily reduced;

      and the nation, during the course of a hundred and fifty years, was

      governed by an authority unknown, in the same degree, to all the kingdoms

      founded by the northern conquerors. Henry I., that he might allure the

      people to give an exclusion to his elder brother Robert, had granted them

      a charter, favorable in many particulars to their liberties; Stephen had

      renewed the grant; Henry II. had confirmed it: but the concessions of all

      these princes had still remained without effect; and the same unlimited,

      at least in regular authority, continued to be exercised both by them and

      their successors. The only happiness was, that arms were never yet

      ravished from the hands of the barons and people: the nation, by a great

      confederacy, might still vindicate its liberties: and nothing was more

      likely than the character, conduct, and fortunes of the reigning prince,

      to produce such a general combination against him. Equally odious and

      contemptible, both in public and private life, he affronted the barons by

      his insolence, dishonored their families by his gallantries, enraged them

      by his tyranny, and gave discontent to all ranks of men by his endless

      exactions and impositions.[*] The effect of these lawless practices had

      already appeared in the general demand made by the barons of a restoration

      of their privileges; and after he had reconciled himself to the pope, by

      abandoning the independence of the kingdom, he appeared to all his

      subjects in so mean a light, that they universally thought they might with

      safety and honor insist upon their pretensions.

     

      But nothing forwarded this confederacy so much as the concurrence of

      Langton, archbishop of Canterbury; a man whose memory, though he was

      obtruded on the nation by a palpable encroachment of the see of Rome,

      ought always to be respected by the English. This prelate, whether he was

      moved by the generosity of his nature and his affection to public good; or

      had entertained an animosity against John, on account of the long

      opposition made by that prince to his election; or thought that an

      acquisition of liberty to the people would serve to increase and secure

      the privileges of the church; had formed the plan of reforming the

      government, and had prepared the way for that great innovation, by

      inserting those singular clauses above mentioned, in the oath which he

      administered to the king, before he would absolve him from the sentence of

      excommunication. Soon after, in a private meeting of some principal barons

      at London, he showed them a copy of Henry I.‘s charter, which, he said, he

      had happily found in a monastery; and he exhorted them to insist on the

      renewal and observance of it: the barons swore that they would sooner lose

      their lives than depart from so reasonable a demand.[**]

     

      The confederacy began now to spread wider, and to comprehend almost all

      the barons in England; and a new and more numerous meeting was summoned by

      Langton at St. Edmondsbury, under color of devotion. He again produced to

      the assembly the old charter of Henry; renewed his exhortations of

      unanimity and vigor in the prosecution of their purpose; and represented

      in the strongest colors the tyranny to which they had so long been

      subjected, and from which it now behoved them to free themselves and their

      posterity.[*] The barons, inflamed by his eloquence, incited by the sense

      of their own wrongs, and encouraged by the appearance of their power and

      numbers, solemnly took an oath, before the high altar, to adhere to each

      other, to insist on their demands, and to make endless war on the king

      till he should submit to grant them.[**] They agreed that, after the

      festival of Christmas, they would prefer in a body their common petition;

      and in the mean time they separated, after mutually engaging that they

      would put themselves in a posture of defence, would enlist men and

      purchase arms, and would supply their castles with the necessary

      provisions.

     

      1215.

     

      The barons appeared in London on the day appointed, and demanded of the

      king, that, in consequence of his own oath before the primate, as well as

      in deference to their just rights, he should grant them a renewal of

      Henry’s charter, and a confirmation of the laws of St. Edward. The king,

      alarmed with their zeal and unanimity, as well as with their power,

      required a delay; promised that, at the festival of Easter, he would give

      them a positive answer to their petition; and offered them the archbishop

      of Canterbury, the bishop of Ely, and the earl of Pembroke, the mareschal,

      as sureties for his fulfilling this engagement.[***] The barons accepted

      of the terms, and peaceably returned to their castles.

     

      During this interval, John, in order to break or subdue the league of his

      barons, endeavored to avail himself of the ecclesiastical power, of whose

      influence he had, from his own recent misfortunes, had such fatal

      experience. He granted to the clergy a charter, relinquishing forever that

      important prerogative for which his father and all his ancestors had

      zealously contended; yielding to them the free election on all vacancies;

      reserving only the power to issue a conge d’Ã©lire and to subjoin a

      confirmation of the election; and declaring that, if either of these were

      withheld, the choice should nevertheless be deemed just and valid.[*] He

      made a vow to lead an army into Palestine against the infidels, and he

      took on him the cross, in hopes that he should receive from the church

      that protection which she tendered to every one that had entered into this

      sacred and meritorious engagement.[**] And he sent to Rome his agent,

      William de Mauclere, in order to appeal to the pope against the violence

      of his barons, and procure him a favorable sentence from that powerful

      tribunal.[***] The barons, also, were not negligent on their part in

      endeavoring to engage the pope in their interests: they despatched Eustace

      de Vescie to Rome; laid their case before Innocent as their feudal lord;

      and petitioned him to interpose his authority with the king, and oblige

      him to restore and confirm all their just and undoubted privileges.[****]

     

      Innocent beheld with regret the disturbances which had arisen in England,

      and was much inclined to favor John in his pretensions. He had no hopes of

      retaining and extending his newly-acquired superiority over that kingdom,

      but by supporting so base and degenerate a prince, who was willing to

      sacrifice every consideration to his present safety: and he foresaw, that

      if the administration should fall into the hands of those gallant and

      high-spirited barons, they would vindicate the honor, liberty, and

      independence of the nation, with the same ardor which they now exerted in

      defence of their own. He wrote letters, therefore, to the prelates, to the

      nobility, and to the king himself. He exhorted the first to employ their

      good offices in conciliating peace between the contending parties, and

      putting an end to civil discord: to the second he expressed his

      disapprobation of their conduct in employing force to extort concessions

      from their reluctant sovereign: the last lie advised to treat his nobles

      with grace and indulgence, and to grant them such of their demands as

      should appear just and reasonable.

     

      The barons easily saw, from the tenor of these letters, that they must

      reckon on having the pope, as well as the king, for their adversary; but

      they had already advanced too far to recede from their pretensions, and

      their passions were so deeply engaged, that it exceeded even the power of

      superstition itself any longer to control them. They also foresaw, that

      the thunders of Rome, when not seconded by the efforts of the English

      ecclesiastics, would be of small avail against them and they perceived

      that the most considerable of the prelates, as well as all the inferior

      clergy, professed the highest approbation of their cause. Besides that

      these men were seized with the national passion for laws and liberty,

      blessings of which they themselves expected to partake, there concurred

      very powerful causes to loosen their devoted attachment to the apostolic

      see. It appeared, from the late usurpations of the Roman pontiff, that he

      pretended to reap alone all the advantages accruing from that victory,

      which under his banners, though at their own peril, they had every where

      obtained over the civil magistrate. The pope assumed a despotic power over

      all the churches; their particular customs, privileges, and immunities

      were treated with disdain; even the canons of general councils were set

      aside by his dispensing power; the whole administration of the church was

      centred in the court of Rome; all preferments ran, of course, in the same

      channel; and the provincial clergy saw, at least felt, that there was a

      necessity for limiting these pretensions. The legate, Nicholas, in filling

      those numerous vacancies which had fallen in England during an interdict

      of six years, had proceeded in the most arbitrary manner; and had paid no

      regard, in conferring dignities, to personal merit, to rank, to the

      inclination of the electors, or to the customs of the country. The English

      church was universally disgusted; and Langton himself, though he owed his

      elevation to an encroachment of the Romish see, was no sooner established

      in his high office, than he became jealous of the privileges annexed to

      it, and formed attachments with the country subjected to his jurisdiction.

      These causes, though they opened slowly the eyes of men, failed not to

      produce their effect: they set bounds to the usurpations of the papacy;

      the tide first stopped, and then turned against the sovereign pontiff; and

      it is otherwise inconceivable, how that age, so prone to superstition, and

      so sunk in ignorance, or rather so devoted to a spurious erudition, could

      have escaped falling into an absolute and total slavery under the court of

      Rome.

     

      About the time that the pope’s letters arrived in England, The malevolent

      barons, on the approach of the festival of Easter, when they were to

      expect the king’s answer to their petition, met by agreement at Stamford;

      and they assembled a force, consisting of above two thousand knights,

      besides then retainers and inferior persons without number. Elated with

      their power, they advanced in a body to Brackley, within fifteen miles of

      Oxford, the place where the court then resided; and they there received a

      message from the king, by the archbishop of Canterbury and the earl of

      Pembroke, desiring to know what those liberties were which they so

      zealously challenged from their sovereign. They delivered to these

      messengers a schedule, containing the chief articles of their demands;

      which was no sooner shown to the king, than he burst into a furious

      passion, and asked why the barons did not also demand of him his kingdom;

      swearing that he would never grant them such liberties as must reduce

      himself to slavery.[*]

     

      No sooner were the confederated nobles informed of John’s reply, than they

      chose Robert Fitz-Walter their general, whom they called “the mareschal of

      the army of God and of holy church;” and they proceeded without further

      ceremony to levy war upon the king. They besieged the castle of

      Northampton during fifteen days, though without success:[**] the gates of

      Bedford castle were willingly opened to them by William Beauchamp, its

      owner: they advanced to Ware in their way to London, where they held a

      correspondence with the principal citizens: they were received without

      opposition into that capital: and finding now the great superiority of

      their force, they issued proclamations, requiring the other barons to join

      them, and menacing them, in case of refusal or delay, with committing

      devastation on their houses and estates.[***] In order to show what might

      be expected from their prosperous arms, they made incursions from London,

      and laid waste the king’s parks and palaces; and all the barons, who had

      hitherto carried the semblance of supporting the royal party, were glad of

      this pretence for openly joining a cause which they always had secretly

      favored. The king was left at Odiham, in Hampshire, with a poor retinue of

      only seven knights; and after trying several expedients to elude the blow,

      after offering to refer all differences to the pope alone, or to eight

      barons, four to be chosen by himself, and four by the confederates,[****]

      he found himself at last obliged to submit at discretion.

     

      A conference between the king and the barons was appointed at Runnemede,

      between Windsor and Staines; a place which has ever since been extremely

      celebrated on account of this great event. The two parties encamped apart,

      like open enemies; and after a debate of a few days, the king, with a

      facility somewhat suspicious, signed and sealed the charter which was

      required of him. This famous deed, commonly called the Great Charter,

      either granted or secured very important liberties and privileges to every

      order of men in the kingdom; to the clergy, to the barons, and to the

      people.

     

      The freedom of elections was secured to the clergy: the former charter of

      the king was confirmed, by which the necessity of a royal conge d’Ã©lire

      and confirmation was superseded: all check upon appeals to Rome was

      removed, by the allowance granted every man to depart the kingdom at

      pleasure: and the fines to be imposed on the clergy, for any offence, were

      ordained to be proportional to their lay estates, not to their

      ecclesiastical benefices.

     

      The privileges granted to the barons were either abatements in the rigor

      of the feudal law, or determinations in points which had been left by that

      law, or had become, by practice, arbitrary and ambiguous. The reliefs of

      heirs succeeding to a military fee were ascertained; an earl’s and baron’s

      at a hundred marks, a knight’s at a hundred shillings. It was ordained by

      the charter that, if the heir be a minor, he shall, immediately upon his

      majority, enter upon his estate, without paying any relief: the king shall

      not sell his wardship; he shall levy only reasonable profits upon the

      estate, without committing waste, or hurting the property: he shall uphold

      the castles, houses, mills, parks, and ponds, and if he commit the

      guardianship of the estate to the sheriff or any other, he shall

      previously oblige them to find surety to the same purpose. During the

      minority of a baron, while his lands are in wardship, and are not in his

      own possession, no debt which he owes to the Jews shall bear any interest.

      Heirs shall be married without disparagement; and before the marriage be

      contracted, the nearest relations of the person shall be informed of it. A

      widow, without paying any relief, shall enter upon her dower, the third

      part of her husband’s rents: she shall not be compelled to marry, so long

      as she chooses to continue single; she shall only give security never to

      marry without her lord’s consent. The king shall not claim the wardship of

      any minor who holds lands by military tenure, of a baron, on pretence that

      he also holds lands of the crown, by soccage or any other tenure. Scutages

      shall be estimated at the same rate as in the time of Henry I.; and no

      scutage or aid, except in the three general feudal cases, the king’s

      captivity, the knighting of his eldest son, and the marrying of his eldest

      daughter, shall be imposed but by the great council of the kingdom; the

      prelates, earls, and great barons, shall be called to this great council,

      each by a particular writ; the lesser barons by a general summons of the

      sheriff. The king shall not seize any baron’s land for a debt to the crown

      if the baron possesses as many goods and chattels as are sufficient to

      discharge the debt. No man shall be obliged to perform more service for

      his fee than he is bound to by his tenure. No governor or constable of a

      castle shall oblige any knight to give money for castle guard, if the

      knight be willing to perform the service in person, or by another

      able-bodied man; and if the knight be in the field himself, by the king’s

      command, he shall be exempted from all other service of this nature. No

      vassal shall be allowed to sell so much of his land as to incapacitate

      himself from performing his service to his lord.

     

      These were the principal articles, calculated for the interest of the

      barons; and had the charter contained nothing further, national happiness

      and liberty had been very little promoted by it, as it would only have

      tended to increase the power and independence of an order of men who were

      already too powerful, and whose yoke might have become more heavy on the

      people than even that of an absolute monarch. But the barons, who alone

      drew and imposed on the prince this memorable charter, were necessitated

      to insert in it other claused of a more extensive and more beneficent

      nature: they could not expect the concurrence of the people without

      comprehending, together with their own, the interest of inferior ranks of

      men; and all provisions, which the barons, for their own sake, were

      obliged to make, in order to insure the free and equitable administration

      of justice, tended directly to the benefit of the whole community. The

      following were the principal clauses of this nature.

     

      It was ordained that all the privileges and immunities above mentioned,

      granted to the barons against the king, should be extended by the barons

      to their inferior vassals. The king bound himself not to grant any writ,

      empowering a baron to levy aids from his vassals, except in the three

      feudal cases. One weight and one measure shall be established throughout

      the kingdom. Merchants shall be allowed to transact all business without

      being exposed to any arbitrary tolls and impositions; they and all free

      men shall be allowed to go out of the kingdom and return to it at

      pleasure: London, and all cities and burghs, shall preserve their ancient

      liberties, immunities, and free customs: aids shall not be required of

      them but by the consent of the great council: no towns or individuals

      shall be obliged to make or support bridges but by ancient custom: the

      goods of every freeman shall he disposed of according to his will: if he

      die intestate, his heirs shall succeed to them. No officer of the crown

      shall take any horses, carts, or wood, without the consent of the owner.

      The king’s courts of justice shall be stationary, and shall no longer

      follow his person: they shall be open to every one; and justice shall no

      longer be sold, refused, or delayed by them. Circuits shall be regularly

      held every year: the inferior tribunals of justice, the county court,

      sheriff’s turn, and court-leet shall meet at their appointed time and

      place: the sheriffs shall be incapacitated to hold pleas of the crown; and

      shall not put any person upon his trial, from rumor or suspicion alone,

      but upon the evidence of lawful witnesses. No freeman shall be taken or

      imprisoned, or dispossessed of his free tenement and liberties, or

      outlawed, or banished, or anywise hurt or injured, unless by the legal

      judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land; and all who suffered

      otherwise in this or the two former reigns, shall be restored to their

      rights and possessions. Every freeman shall be fined in proportion to his

      fault; and no fine shall be levied on him to his utter ruin; even a

      villain or rustic shall not by any fine be bereaved of his carts, ploughs,

      and implements of husbandry. This was the only article calculated for the

      interests of this body of men, probably at that time the most numerous in

      the kingdom.

     

      It must be confessed that the former articles of the Great Charter contain

      such mitigations and explanations of the feudal law as are reasonable and

      equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal

      government, and provide for the equal distribution of justice, and free

      enjoyment of property; the great objects for which political society was

      at first founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable

      right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor statute, nor

      positive institution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermost in

      their thoughts and attention. Though the provisions made by this charter

      might, conformably to the genius of the age, be esteemed too concise, and

      too bare of circumstances to maintain the execution of its articles, in

      opposition to the chicanery of lawyers, supported by the violence of

      power, time gradually ascertained the sense of all the ambiguous

      expressions; and those generous barons, who first extorted this

      concession, still held their swords in their hands, and could turn them

      against those who dared, on any pretence, to depart from the original

      spirit and meaning of the grant. We may now, from the tenor of this

      charter, conjecture what those laws were of King Edward which the English

      nation, during so many generations, still desired, with such an obstinate

      perseverance, to have recalled and established. They were chiefly these

      latter articles of Magna Charta; and the barons who, at the beginning of

      these commotions, demanded the revival of the Saxon laws, undoubtedly

      thought that they had sufficiently satisfied the people by procuring them

      this concession, which comprehended the principal objects to which they

      had so long aspired. But what we are most to admire is, the prudence and

      moderation of those haughty nobles themselves, who were enraged by

      injuries, inflamed by opposition, and elated by a total victory over their

      sovereign. They were content, even in this plenitude of power, to depart

      from some articles of Henry I.‘s charter, which they made the foundation

      of their demands, particularly from the abolition of wardships, a matter

      of the greatest importance; and they seem to have been sufficiently

      careful not to diminish too far the power and revenue of the crown. If

      they appear, therefore, to have carried other demands to too great a

      height, it can be ascribed only to the faithless and tyrannical character

      of the king himself, of which they had long had experience, and which they

      foresaw would, if they provided no further security, lead him soon to

      infringe their new liberties, and revoke his own concessions. This alone

      gave birth to those other articles, seemingly exorbitant, which were added

      as a rampart for the safeguard of the Great Charter.

     

      The barons obliged the king to agree that London should remain in their

      hands, and the Tower be consigned to the custody of the primate, till the

      15th of August ensuing, or till the execution of the several articles of

      the Great Charter. The better to insure the same end, he allowed them to

      choose five-and-twenty members from their own body, as conservators of the

      public liberties; and no bounds were set to the authority of these men

      either in extent or duration. If any complaint were made of a violation of

      the charter, whether attempted by the king, justiciaries, sheriffs, or

      foresters, any four of these barons might admonish the king to redress the

      grievance: if satisfaction were not obtained, they could assemble the

      whole council of twenty-five; who, in conjunction with the great council,

      were empowered to compel him to observe the charter, and, in case of

      resistance, might levy war against him, attack his castles, and employ

      every kind of violence, except against his royal person, and that of his

      queen and children. All men throughout the kingdom were bound, under the

      penalty of confiscation, to swear obedience to the twenty-five barons; and

      the freeholders of each county were to choose twelve knights, who were to

      make report of such evil customs as required redress, conformably to the

      tenor of the Great Charter.[*] The names of those conservators were, the

      earls of Clare, Albemarle, Glocesteer, Winchester, Hereford, Roger Bigod,

      earl of Norfolk, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, William Mareschal the

      younger, Robert Fitz-Walter, Gilbert de Clare, Eustace de Vescey, Gilbert

      Delaval, William de Moubray, Geoffrey de Say, Roger de Mombezon, William

      de Huntingfield, Robert de Ros, the constable of Chester, William de

      Aubenie, Richard de Perci, William Malet, John Fitz-Robert, William de

      Lanvalay, Hugh de Bigod, and Roger de Montfichet. These men were, by this

      convention, really invested with the sovereignty of the kingdom: they were

      rendered coordinate with the king, or rather superior to him, in the

      exercise of the executive power; and as there was no circumstance of

      government which, either directly or indirectly, might not bear a relation

      to the security or observance of the Great Charter, there could scarcely

      occur any incident in which they might not lawfully interpose their

      authority.

     

      John seemed to submit passively to all these regulations, however

      injurious to majesty: he sent writs to all the sheriffs, ordering them to

      constrain every one to swear obedience to the twenty-five barons: he

      dismissed all his foreign force; he pretended, that his government was

      thenceforth to run in a new tenor, and be more indulgent to the liberty

      and independence of his people. But he only dissembled till he should find

      a favorable opportunity for annulling all his concessions. The injuries

      and indignities which he had formerly suffered from the pope and the king

      of France, as they came from equals or superiors, seemed to make but small

      impression on him; but the sense of this perpetual and total subjection

      under his own rebellious vassals, sunk deep in his mind; and he was

      determined, at all hazards, to throw off so ignominious a slavery. He grew

      sullen, silent, and reserved: he shunned the society of his courtiers and

      nobles: he retired into the Isle of Wight, as if desirous of hiding his

      shame and confusion; but in this retreat he meditated the most fatal

      vengeance against all his enemies. He secretly sent abroad his emissaries

      to enlist foreign soldiers, and to invite the rapacious BrabanÃ§ons into

      his service, by the prospect of sharing the spoils of England, and reaping

      the forfeitures of so many opulent barons, who had incurred the guilt of

      rebellion, by rising in arms against him. And he despatched a messenger to

      Rome, in order to lay before the pope the Great Charter, which he had been

      compelled to sign, and to complain, before that tribunal, of the violence

      which had been imposed upon him.

     

      Innocent, considering himself as feudal lord of the kingdom, was incensed

      at the temerity of the barons, who, though they pretended to appeal to his

      authority, had dared, without waiting for his consent, to impose such

      terms on a prince, who, by resigning to the Roman pontiff his crown and

      independence, had placed himself immediately under the papal protection.

      He issued, therefore, a bull, in which, from the plenitude of his

      apostolic power, and from the authority which God had committed to him, to

      build and destroy kingdoms, to plant and overthrow, he annulled and

      abrogated the whole charter, as unjust in itself, as obtained by

      compulsion, and as derogatory to the dignity of the apostolic see. He

      prohibited the barons from exacting the observance of it: he even

      prohibited the king himself from paying any regard to it: he absolved him

      and his subjects from all oaths which they had been constrained to take to

      that purpose; and he pronounced a general sentence of excommunication

      against every one who should persevere in maintaining such treasonable and

      iniquitous pretensions.

     

      The king, as his foreign forces arrived along with this bull now ventured

      to take off the mask; and, under sanction of the pope’s decree, recalled

      all the liberties which he had granted to his subjects, and which he had

      solemnly sworn to observe. But the spiritual weapon was found upon trial

      to carry less force with it than he had reason from his own experience to

      apprehend. The primate refused to obey the pope in publishing the sentence

      of excommunication against the barons; and though he was cited to Rome,

      that he might attend a general council there assembled, and was suspended,

      on account of his disobedience to the pope, and his secret correspondence

      with the king’s enemies; though a new and particular sentence of

      excommunication was pronounced by name against the principal barons; John

      still found that his nobility and people, and even his clergy, adhered to

      the defence of their liberties, and to their combination against him: the

      sword of his foreign mercenaries was all he had to trust to for restoring

      his authority.

     

      The barons, after obtaining the Great Charter, seem to have been lulled

      into a fatal security, and to have taken no rational measures, in case of

      the introduction of a foreign force, for reassembling their armies. The

      king was, from the first, master of the field; and immediately laid siege

      to the castle of Rochester, which was obstinately defended by William de

      Albiney, at the head of a hundred and forty knights with their retainers,

      but was at last, reduced by famine. John, irritated with the resistance,

      intended to have hanged the governor and all the garrison; but on the

      representation of William de Mauleon, who suggested to him the danger of

      reprisals, he was content to sacrifice, in this barbarous manner, the

      inferior prisoners only. The captivity of William de Albiney, the best

      officer among the confederated barons, was an irreparable loss to their

      cause; and no regular opposition was thenceforth made to the progress of

      the royal arms. The ravenous and barbarous mercenaries, incited by a cruel

      and enraged prince were let loose against the estates, tenants, manors,

      houses, parks of the barons, and spread devastation over the face of the

      kingdom. Nothing was to be seen but the flames of villages, and castles

      reduced to ashes, the consternation and misery of the inhabitants,

      tortures exercised by the soldiery to make them reveal their concealed

      treasures, and reprisals no less barbarous, committed by the barons and

      their partisans on the royal demesnes, and on the estates of such as still

      adhered to the crown. The king, marching through the whole extent of

      England, from Dover to Berwick, laid the provinces waste on each side of

      him; and considered every estate, which was not his immediate property, as

      entirely hostile, and the object of military execution. The nobility of

      the north in particular, who had shown greatest violence in the recovery

      of their liberties, and who, acting in a separate body, had expressed

      their discontent even at the concessions made by the Great Charter, as

      they could expect no mercy, fled before him with their wives and families,

      and purchased the friendship of Alexander, the young king of Scots, by

      doing homage to him.

     

      The barons, reduced to this desperate extremity, and menaced with the

      total loss of their liberties, their properties, and their lives, employed

      a remedy no less desperate; and making applications to the court of

      France, they offered to acknowledge Lewis, the eldest son of Philip, for

      their sovereign, on condition that he would afford them protection from

      the violence of their enraged prince. Though the sense of the common

      rights of mankind, the only rights that are entirely indefeasible, might

      have justified them in the deposition of their king, they declined

      insisting before Philip on a pretension which is commonly so disagreeable

      to sovereigns, and which sounds harshly in their royal ears. They affirmed

      that John was incapable of succeeding to the crown, by reason of the

      attainder passed upon him during his brother’s reign; though that

      attainder had been reversed, and Richard had even, by his last will,

      declared him his successor. They pretended, that he was already legally

      deposed by sentence of the peers of France, on account of the murder of

      his nephew; though that sentence could not possibly regard any thing but

      his transmarine dominions, which alone he held in vassalage to that crown.

      On more plausible grounds, they affirmed, that he had already deposed

      himself by doing homage to the pope, changing the nature of his

      sovereignty, and resigning an independent crown for a fee under a foreign

      power. And as Blanche of Castile, the wife of Lewis, was descended by her

      mother from Henry II., they maintained, though many other princes stood

      before her in the order of succession, that they had not shaken off the

      royal family, in choosing her husband for their sovereign.

     

      Philip was strongly tempted to lay hold on the rich prize which was

      offered to him. The legate menaced him with interdicts and

      excommunications, if he invaded the patrimony of St. Peter, or attacked a

      prince who was under the immediate protection of the holy see; but as

      Philip was assured of the obedience of his own vassals, his principles

      were changed with the times, and he now undervalued as much all papal

      censures, as he formerly pretended to pay respect to them. His chief

      scruple was with regard to the fidelity which he might expect from the

      English barons in their new engagements, and the danger of intrusting his

      son and heir into the hands of men who might, on any caprice or necessity,

      make peace with their native sovereign, by sacrificing a pledge of so much

      value. He therefore exacted from the barons twenty-five hostages of the

      most noble birth in the kingdom; and having obtained this security, he

      sent over first a small army to the relief of the confederates; then more

      numerous forces, which arrived with Lewis himself at their head.

     

      The first effect of the young prince’s appearance in England was the

      desertion of John’s foreign troops, who, being mostly levied in Flanders,

      and other provinces of France, refused to serve against the heir of their

      monarchy. The Gascons and Poictevins alone, who were still John’s

      subjects, adhered to his cause; but they were too weak to maintain that

      superiority in the field which they had hitherto supported against the

      confederated barons. Many considerable noblemen deserted John’s party, the

      earls of Salisbury, Arundel, Warrenne, Oxford, Albemarle, and William

      Mareschal the younger: his castles fell daily into the hands of the enemy;

      Dover was the only place which, from the valor and fidelity of Hubert de

      Burgh, the governor, made resistance to the progress of Lewis; and the

      barons had the melancholy prospect of finally succeeding in their purpose,

      and of escaping the tyranny of their own king, by imposing on themselves

      and the nation a foreign yoke. But this union was of short duration

      between the French and English nobles; and the imprudence of Lewis, who on

      every occasion showed too visible a preference to the former, increased

      that jealousy which it was so natural for the latter to entertain in their

      present situation. The viscount of Melun, too, it is said, one of his

      courtiers, fell sick at London; and finding the approaches of death, he

      sent for some of his friends among the English barons, and warning them of

      their danger, revealed Lewis’s secret intentions of exterminating them and

      their families as traitors to their prince, and of bestowing their estates

      and dignities on his native subjects, in whose fidelity he could more

      reasonably place confidence. This story, whether true or false, was

      universally reported and believed; and, concurring with other

      circumstances, which rendered it credible, did great prejudice to the

      cause of Lewis. The earl of Salisbury and other noblemen deserted again to

      John’s party; and as men easily change sides in a civil war, especially

      where their power is founded on an hereditary and independent authority,

      and is not derived from the opinion and favor of the people, the French

      prince had reason to dread a sudden reverse of fortune. The king was

      assembling a considerable army, with a view of fighting one great battle

      for his crown; but passing from Lynne to Lincolnshire, his road lay along

      the sea-shore, which was overflowed at high water; and not choosing the

      proper time for his journey, he lost in the inundation all his carriages,

      treasure, baggage, and regalia. The affliction for this disaster, and

      vexation from the distracted state of his affairs, increased the sickness

      under which he then labored; and though he reached the castle of Newark,

      he was obliged to halt there, and his distemper soon after put an end to

      his life, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and eighteenth of his reign;

      and freed the nation from the dangers to which it was equally exposed by

      his success or by his misfortunes.

     

      The character of this prince is nothing but a complication of vices,

      equally mean and odious; ruinous to himself and destructive to his people.

      Cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity licentiousness, ingratitude,

      treachery, tyranny, and cruelty all these qualities appear too evidently

      in the several incidents of his life, to give us room to suspect that the

      disagreeable picture has been anywise overcharged by the prejudices of the

      ancient historians. It is hard to say whether his conduct to his father,

      his brother, his nephew, or his subjects, was most culpable; or whether

      his crimes, in these respects, were not even exceeded by the baseness

      which appeared in his transactions with the king of France, the pope, and

      the barons. His European dominions, when they devolved to him by the death

      of his brother, were more extensive than have ever, since his time, been

      ruled by any English monarch: but he first lost by his misconduct the

      flourishing provinces in France, the ancient patrimony of his family: he

      subjected his kingdom to a shameful vassalage under the see of Rome: he

      saw the prerogatives of his crown diminished by law, and still more

      reduced by faction; and he died at last, when in danger of being totally

      expelled by a foreign power, and of either ending his life miserably in

      prison, or seeking shelter as a fugitive from the pursuit of his enemies.

     

      The prejudices against this prince were so violent, that he was believed

      to have sent an embassy to the Miramoulin, or emperor of Morocco, and to

      have offered to change his religion and become Mahometan, in order to

      purchase the protection of that monarch. But though this story is told us,

      on plausible authority, by Matthew Paris,* it is in itself utterly

      improbable; except that there is nothing so incredible but may be believed

      to proceed from the folly and wickedness of John.

     

      The monks throw great reproaches on this prince for his impiety, and even

      infidelity; and as an instance of it, they tell us that, having one day

      caught a very fat stag, he exclaimed, “How plump and well fed is this

      animal! and yet I dare swear he never heard mass.” This sally of wit upon

      the usual corpulency of the priests, more than all his enormous crimes and

      iniquities, made him pass with them for an atheist.

     

      John left two legitimate sons behind him, Henry, born on the first of

      October, 1207, and now nine years of age; and Richard, born on the sixth

      of January, 1209; and three daughters, Jane, afterwards married to

      Alexander, king of Scots; Eleanor, married first to William Mareschal the

      younger, earl of Pembroke, and then to Simon Mountfort earl of Leicester;

      and Isabella, married to the emperor Frederic II. All these children were

      born to him by Isabella of Angouleme, his second wife. His illegitimate

      children were numerous; but none of them were anywise distinguished.

     

      It was this king who, in the ninth year of his reign, first gave by

      charter to the city of London, the right of electing annually a mayor out

      of its own body, an office which was till now held for life. He gave the

      city also power to elect and remove its sheriffs at pleasure, and its

      common-council men annually. London bridge was finished in this reign: the

      former bridge was of wood. Maud, the empress, was the first that built a

      stone bridge in England
