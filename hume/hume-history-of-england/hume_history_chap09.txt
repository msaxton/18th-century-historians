As Britain was first peopled from Gaul, so was Ireland probably from

      Britain; and the inhabitants of all these countries seem to have been so

      many tribes of the Celtae, who derive their origin from an antiquity that

      lies far beyond the records of any history or tradition. The Irish, from

      the beginning of time, had been buried in the most profound barbarism and

      ignorance; and as they were never conquered or even invaded by the Romans,

      from whom all the western world derived its civility, they continued still

      in the most rude state of society, and were distinguished by those vices

      alone, to which human nature, not tamed by education or restrained by

      laws, is forever subject. The small principalities into which they were

      divided, exercised perpetual rapine and violence against each other: the

      uncertain succession of their princes was a continual source of domestic

      convulsions; the usual title of each petty sovereign was the murder of his

      predecessor; courage and force, though exercised in the commission of

      crimes, were more honored than any pacific virtues; and the most simple

      arts of life, even tillage and agriculture, were almost wholly unknown

      among them. They had felt the invasions of the Danes and the other

      northern tribes; but these inroads, which had spread barbarism in other

      parts of Europe, tended rather to improve the Irish; and the only towns

      which were to be found in the island, had been planted along the coast by

      the freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other inhabitants exercised

      pasturage in the open country, sought protection from any danger in their

      forests and morasses, and being divided by the fiercest animosities

      against each other, were still more intent on the means of mutual injury

      than on the expedients for common or even for private interest.

     

      Besides many small tribes, there were in the age of Henry II. five

      principal sovereignties in the island, Minister, Leinster Meath, Ulster,

      and Connaught; and as it had been usual for the one or the other of these

      to take the lead in their wars, there was commonly some prince, who

      seemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ireland. Roderic O’Connor, king

      of Connaught, was then advanced to this dignity;[*] but his government,

      ill obeyed even within his own territory, could not unite the people in

      any measures, either for the establishment of order, or for defence

      against foreigners.

     

      The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign, been moved, by the

      prospect of these advantages, to attempt the subjecting of Ireland; and a

      pretence was only wanting to invade a people who, being always confined to

      their own island, had never given any reason of complaint to any of their

      neighbors. For this purpose he had recourse to Rome, which assumed a right

      to dispose of kingdoms and empires; and not foreseeing the dangerous

      disputes which he was one day to maintain with that see, he helped, for

      present, or rather for an imaginary convenience, to give sanction to

      claims which were now become dangerous to all sovereigns. Adrian III., who

      then filled the papal chair, was by birth an Englishman; and being on that

      account the more disposed to oblige Henry, he was easily persuaded to act

      as master of the world, and to make, without any hazard or expense, the

      acquisition of a great island to his spiritual jurisdiction. The Irish

      had, by precedent missions from the Britons, been imperfectly converted to

      Christianity; and, what the pope regarded as the surest mark of their

      imperfect conversion, they followed the doctrines of their first teachers,

      and had never acknowledged any subjection to the see of Rome. Adrian,

      therefore, in the year 1156 issued a bull in favor of Henry; in which,

      after premising that this prince had ever shown an anxious care to enlarge

      the church of God on earth, and to increase the number of his saints and

      elect in heaven, he represents his design of subduing Ireland as derived

      from the same pious motives: he considers his care of previously applying

      for the apostolic sanction as a sure earnest of success and victory; and

      having established it as a point incontestable, that all Christian

      kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it to be

      his own duty to sow among them the seeds of the gospel, which might in the

      last day fructify to their eternal salvation: he exhorts the king to

      invade Ireland, in order to extirpate the vice and wickedness of the

      natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every house a penny to the

      see of Rome: he gives him entire right and authority over the island,

      commands all the inhabitants to obey him as their sovereign, and invests

      with full power all such godly instruments as he should think proper to

      employ in an enterprise thus calculated for the glory of God and the

      salvation of the souls of men.[*] Henry, though armed with this authority,

      did not immediately put his design in execution; but being detained by

      more interesting business on the continent, waited for a favorable

      opportunity of invading Ireland. Dermot Macmorrogh, king of Leinster, had,

      by his licentious tyranny, rendered himself odious to his subjects, who

      seized with alacrity the first occasion that offered of throwing off the

      yoke, which was become grievous and oppressive to them. This prince had

      formed a design on Dovergilda, wife of Ororic, prince of Breffny; and

      taking advantage of her husband’s absence, who, being obliged to visit a

      distant part of his territory, had left his wife secure, as he thought, in

      an island surrounded by a bog, he suddenly invaded the place, and carried

      off the princess.[**] This exploit, though usual among the Irish, and

      rather deemed a proof of gallantry and spirit,[***] provoked the

      resentment of the husband; who, having collected forces, and being

      strengthened by the alliance of Roderic, king of Connaught, invaded the

      dominions of Dermot, and expelled him his kingdom. The exiled prince had

      recourse to Henry, who was at this time in Guienne, craved his assistance

      in restoring him to his sovereignty, and offered, on that event, to hold

      his kingdom in vassalage under the crown of England. Henry, whose views

      were already turned towards making acquisitions in Ireland, readily

      accepted the offer; but being at that time embarrassed by the rebellions

      of his French subjects, as well as by his disputes with the see of Rome,

      he declined, for the present, embarking in the enterprise, and gave Dermot

      no further assistance than letters patent, by which he empowered all his

      subjects to aid the Irish prince in the recovery of his dominions.[****]

     

      Dermot, supported by this authority, came to Bristol; and after

      endeavoring, though for some time in vain, to engage adventurers in the

      enterprise, he at last formed a treaty with Richard, surnamed Strongbow,

      earl of Strigul. This nobleman, who was of the illustrious house of Clare,

      had impaired his fortune by expensive pleasures; and being ready for any

      desperate undertaking, he promised assistance to Dermot, on condition that

      he should espouse Eva, daughter of that prince, and be declared heir to

      all his dominions. While Richard was assembling his succors, Dermot went

      into Wales; and meeting with Robert Fitz-Stephens, constable of Abertivi,

      and Maurice Fitz-Gerald he also engaged them in his service, and obtained

      their promise of invading Ireland. Being now assured of succor, he

      returned privately to his own state; and lurking in the monastery of

      Fernes, which he had founded, (for this ruffian was also a founder of

      monasteries,) he prepared every thing for the reception of his English

      allies.

     

      The troops of Fitz-Stephens were first ready. That gentleman landed in

      Ireland with thirty knights, sixty esquires, and three hundred archers;

      but this small body, being brave men, not unacquainted with discipline,

      and completely armed,—a thing almost unknown in Ireland,—struck

      a great terror into the barbarous inhabitants, and seemed to menace them

      with some signal revolution. The conjunction of Maurice de Prendergast,

      who, about the same time, brought over ten knights and sixty archers,

      enabled Fitz-Stephens to attempt the siege of Wexford, a town inhabited by

      the Danes; and after gaining an advantage, he made himself master of the

      place. Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived with ten knights, thirty esquires,

      and a hundred archers; and being joined by the former adventurers,

      composed a force which nothing in Ireland was able to withstand. Roderic,

      the chief monarch of the island, was foiled in different actions: the

      prince of Ossory was obliged to submit, and give hostages for his

      peaceable behavior; and Dermot, not content with being restored to his

      kingdom of Leinster, projected the dethroning of Roderic, and aspired to

      the sole dominion over the Irish.

     

      In prosecution of these views, he sent over a messenger to the earl of

      Strigul, challenging the performance of his promise, and displaying the

      mighty advantages which might now be reaped by a reÃ«nforcement of warlike

      troops from England. Richard, not satisfied with the general allowance

      given by Henry to all his subjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy,

      and having obtained a cold or ambiguous permission, prepared himself for

      the execution of his designs. He first sent over Raymond, one of his

      retinue, with ten knights and seventy archers, who, landing near

      Waterford, defeated a body of three thousand Irish that had ventured to

      attack him, and as Richard himself, who brought over two hundred horse and

      a body of archers, joined, a few days after, the victorious English, they

      made themselves masters of Waterford, and proceeded to Dublin, which was

      taken by assault. Roderic, in revenge, cut off the head of Dermot’s

      natural son, who had been left as a hostage in his hands; and Richard,

      marrying Eva, became soon after, by the death of Dermot, master of the

      kingdom of Leinster, and prepared to extend his authority over all

      Ireland. Roderic, and the other Irish princes, were alarmed at the danger;

      and combining together, besieged Dublin with an army of thirty thousand

      men; but Earl Richard, making a sudden sally at the head of ninety knights

      with their followers, put this numerous army to rout, chased them off the

      field, and pursued them with great slaughter. None in Ireland now dared to

      oppose themselves to the English.

     

      Henry, jealous of the progress made by his own subjects, sent orders to

      recall all the English, and he made preparations to attack Ireland in

      person; but Richard and the other adventurers found means to appease him,

      by making him the most humble submissions, and offering to hold all their

      acquisitions in vassalage to his crown. That monarch landed in Ireland at

      the head of five hundred knights, besides other soldiers; he found the

      Irish so dispirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a progress which

      he made through the island, he had no other occupation than to receive the

      homage of his new subjects. He left most of the Irish chieftains or

      princes in possession of their ancient territories; bestowed some lands on

      the English adventurers; gave Earl Richard the commission of seneschal of

      Ireland; and after a stay of a few months, returned in triumph to England.

      By these trivial exploits, scarcely worth relating, except for the

      importance of the consequences, was Ireland subdued, and annexed to the

      English crown.

     

      The low state of commerce and industry during those ages made it

      impracticable for princes to support regular armies, which might retain a

      conquered country in subjection; and the extreme barbarism and poverty of

      Ireland could still less afford means of bearing the expense. The only

      expedient by which a durable conquest could then be made or maintained,

      was by pouring in a multitude of new inhabitants, dividing among them the

      lands of the vanquished, establishing them in all offices of trust and

      authority, and thereby transforming the ancient inhabitants into a new

      people. By this policy the northern invaders of old, and of late the duke

      of Normandy, had been able to fix their dominions, and to erect kingdoms

      which remained stable on their foundations, and were transmitted to the

      posterity of the first conquerors. But the state of Ireland rendered that

      island so little inviting to the English, that only a few of desperate

      fortunes could be persuaded, from time to time, to transport themselves

      thither; and instead of reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated

      manners, they were gradually assimilated to the ancient inhabitants, and

      degenerated from the customs of their own nation. It was also found

      requisite to bestow great military and arbitrary powers on the leaders,

      who commanded a handful of men amidst such hostile multitudes; and law and

      equity, in a little time, became as much unknown in the English

      settlements, as they had ever been among the Irish tribes. Palatinates

      were erected in favor of the new adventurers; independent authority

      conferred; the natives, never fully subdued, still retained their

      animosity against the conquerors; their hatred was retaliated by like

      injuries; and from these causes the Irish, during the course of four

      centuries, remained still savage and untractable: it was not till the

      latter end of Elizabeth’s reign, that the island was fully subdued; nor

      till that of her successor, that it gave hopes of becoming a useful

      conquest to the English nation.

     

      Besides that the easy and peaceable submission of the Irish left Henry no

      further occupation in that island, he was recalled from it by another

      incident, which was of the last importance to his interest and safety. The

      two legates, Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed the trial of his

      conduct in the murder of Archbishop Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and

      being impatient of delay, sent him frequent letters, full of menaces, if

      he protracted any longer making his appearance before them. He hastened

      therefore to Normandy, and had a conference with them at Savigny, where

      their demands were so exorbitant, that he broke off the negotiation,

      threatened to return to Ireland, and bade them do their worst against him.

      They perceived that the season was now past for taking advantage of that

      tragical incident; which, had it been hotly pursued by interdicts and

      excommunications, was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into

      combustion. But the time which Henry had happily gained, had contributed

      to appease the minds of men; the event could not now have the same

      influence as when it was recent; and as the clergy every day looked for an

      accommodation with the king, they had not opposed the pretensions of his

      partisans, who had been very industrious in representing to the people his

      entire innocence in the murder of the primate, and his ignorance of the

      designs formed by the assassins. The legates, therefore, found themselves

      obliged to lower their terms; and Henry was so fortunate as to conclude an

      accommodation with them. He declared upon oath, before the relics of the

      saints, that so far from commanding or desiring the death of the arch

      bishop, he was extremely grieved when he received intelligence of it; but

      as the passion which he had expressed on account of that prelate’s

      conduct, had probably been the occasion of his murder, he stipulated the

      following conditions as an atonement for the offence. He promised, that he

      should pardon all such as had been banished for adhering to Becket, and

      should restore them to their livings; that the see of Canterbury should be

      reinstated in all its ancient possessions; that he should pay the templars

      a sum of money sufficient for the subsistence of two hundred knights

      during a year in the Holy Land; that he should himself take the cross at

      the Christmas following, and, if the pope required it, serve three years

      against the infidels, either in Spain or Palestine; that he should not

      insist on the observance of such customs derogatory to ecclesiastical

      privileges, as had been introduced in his own time; and that he should not

      obstruct appeals to the pope in ecclesiastical causes, but should content

      himself with exacting sufficient security from such clergymen as left his

      dominions to prosecute an appeal, that they should attempt nothing against

      the rights of his crown. Upon signing these concessions, Henry received

      absolution from the legates, and was confirmed in the grant of Ireland

      made by Pope Adrian; and nothing proves more strongly the great abilities

      of this monarch than his extricating himself on such easy terms from so

      difficult a situation. He had always insisted, that the laws established

      at Clarendon contained not any new claims, but the ancient customs of the

      kingdom; and he was still at liberty, notwithstanding the articles of this

      agreement, to maintain his pretensions. Appeals to the pope were indeed

      permitted by that treaty; but as the king was also permitted to exact

      reasonable securities from the parties, and might stretch his demands on

      this head as far as he pleased, he had it virtually in his power to

      prevent the pope from reaping any advantage by this seeming concession.

      And on the whole, the constitutions of Clarendon remained still the law of

      the realm; though the pope and his legates seem so little to have

      conceived the king’s power to lie under any legal limitations, that they

      were satisfied with his departing, by treaty, from one of the most

      momentous articles of these constitutions, without requiring any repeal by

      the states of the kingdom.

     

      Henry, freed from this dangerous controversy with the ecclesiastics and

      with the see of Rome, seemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human

      grandeur and felicity, and to be equally happy in his domestic situation

      and in his political government. A numerous progeny of sons and daughters

      gave both lustre and authority to his crown, prevented the danger of a

      disputed succession, and repressed all pretensions of the ambitious

      barons. The king’s precaution also, in establishing the several branches

      of his family, seemed well calculated to prevent all jealousy among the

      brothers, and to perpetuate the greatness of his family. He had appointed

      Henry, his eldest son, to be his successor in the kingdom of England, the

      duchy of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine;

      territories which lay contiguous, and which, by that means, might easily

      lend to each other mutual assistance both against intestine commotions and

      foreign invasions. Richard, his second son, was invested in the duchy of

      Guienne and county of Poictou; Geoffrey, his third son, inherited, in

      right of his wife, the duchy of Brittany, and the new conquest of Ireland

      was destined for the appanage of John, his fourth son. He had also

      negotiated, in favor of this last prince, a marriage with Adelais, the

      only daughter of Humbert, count of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive

      as her dowry considerable demesnes in Piedmont, Savoy, Bresse, and

      Dauphiny. But this exaltation of his family excited the jealousy of all

      his neighbors, who made those very sons, whose fortunes he had so

      anxiously established, the means of imbittering his future life, and

      disturbing his government.

     

      Young Henry, who was rising to man’s estate, began to display his

      character, and aspire to independence: brave, ambitious, liberal,

      munificent, affable: he discovered qualities which give great lustre to

      youth; prognosticate a shining fortune; but, unless tempered in mature age

      with discretion, are the forerunners of the greatest calamities. It is

      said that at the time when this prince received the holy unction, his

      father, in order to give greater dignity to the ceremony, officiated at

      table as one of the retinue; and observed to his son that never king was

      more royally served. “It is nothing extraordinary,” said young Henry to

      one of his courtiers, “if the son of a count should serve the son of a

      king.” This saying, which might pass only for an innocent pleasantry, or

      even for an oblique compliment to his father, was, however, regarded as a

      symptom of his aspiring temper; and his conduct soon after justified the

      conjecture.

     

      1173.

     

      Henry, agreeable to the promise which he had given both to the pope and

      French king, permitted his son to be crowned anew by the hands of the

      archbishop of Rouen, and associated the Princess Margaret, spouse to young

      Henry, in the ceremony.[*] He afterwards allowed him to pay a visit to his

      father-in-law at Paris, who took the opportunity of instilling into the

      young prince those ambitious sentiments to which he was naturally but too

      much inclined.

     

      Though it had been the constant practice of France, ever since the

      accession of the Capetian line, to crown the son during the lifetime of

      the father without conferring on him any present participation of royalty;

      Lewis persuaded his son-in-law, that, by this ceremony, which in those

      ages was deemed so important, he had acquired a title to sovereignty, and

      that the king could not, without injustice, exclude him from immediate

      possession of the whole, or at least a part of his dominions. In

      consequence of these extravagant ideas, young Henry, on his return,

      desired the king to resign to him either the crown of England or the duchy

      of Normandy; discovered great discontent on the refusal; spake in the most

      undutiful terms of his father; and soon after, in concert with Lewis, made

      his escape to Paris, where he was protected and supported by that monarch.

     

      While Henry was alarmed at this incident, and had the prospect of

      dangerous intrigues, or even of a war, which, whether successful or not,

      must be extremely calamitous and disagreeable to him, he received

      intelligence of new misfortunes, which must have affected him in the most

      sensible manner. Queen Eleanor, who had disgusted her first husband by her

      gallantries, was no less offensive to her second by her jealousy; and

      after this manner carried to extremity, in the different periods of her

      life, every circumstance of female weakness. She communicated her

      discontents against Henry to her two younger sons, Geoffrey and Richard;

      persuaded them that they were also entitled to present possession of the

      territories assigned to them; engaged them to fly secretly to the court of

      France; and was meditating herself an escape to the same court, and had

      even put on man’s apparel for that purpose, when she was seized by orders

      from her husband, and thrown into confinement. Thus Europe saw with

      astonishment the best and most indulgent of parents at war with his whole

      family; three boys, scarcely arrived at the age of puberty, require a

      great monarch, in the full vigor of his age and height of his reputation,

      to dethrone himself in their favor; and several princes not ashamed to

      support them in these unnatural and absurd pretensions.

     

      Henry, reduced to this perilous and disagreeable situation, had recourse

      to the court of Rome. Though sensible of the danger attending the

      interposition of ecclesiastical authority in temporal disputes, he applied

      to the pope, as his superior lord, to excommunicate his enemies, and by

      these censures to reduce to obedience his undutiful children, whom he

      found such reluctance to punish by the sword of the magistrate.[*]

      Alexander, well pleased to exert his power in so justifiable a cause,

      issued the bulls required of him; but it was soon found, that these

      spiritual weapons had not the same force as when employed in a spiritual

      controversy; and that the clergy were very negligent in supporting a

      sentence which was nowise calculated to promote the immediate interests of

      their order. The king, after taking in vain this humiliating step, was

      obliged to have recourse to arms, and to enlist such auxiliaries as are

      the usual resource of tyrants, and have seldom been employed by so wise

      and just a monarch.

     

      The loose government which prevailed in all the states of Europe, the many

      private wars carried on among the neighboring nobles, and the

      impossibility of enforcing any general execution of the laws, had

      encouraged a tribe of banditti to disturb every where the public peace, to

      infest the highways, to pillage the open country, and to brave all the

      efforts of the civil magistrate, and even the excommunications of the

      church, which were fulminated against them. Troops of them were sometimes

      enlisted in the service of one prince or baron, sometimes in that of

      another: they often acted in an independent manner, under leaders of their

      own; the peaceable and industrious inhabitants, reduced to poverty by

      their ravages, were frequently obliged for subsistence to betake

      themselves to a like disorderly course of life; and a continual intestine

      war, pernicious to industry, as well as to the execution of justice, was

      thus carried on in the bowels of every kingdom. Those desperate ruffians

      received the name sometimes of BrabanÃ§ons, sometimes of Routiers or

      Cottereaux; but for what reason is not agreed by historians; and they

      formed a kind of society or government among themselves, which set at

      defiance the rest of mankind. The greatest monarchs were not ashamed, on

      occasion, to have recourse to their assistance; and as their habits of war

      and depredation had given them experience, hardiness, and courage, they

      generally composed the most formidable part of those armies which decided

      the political quarrels of princes. Several of them were enlisted among the

      forces levied by Henry’s enemies; but the great treasures amassed by that

      prince enabled him to engage more numerous troops of them in his service;

      and the situation of his affairs rendered even such banditti the only

      forces on whose fidelity he could repose any confidence.

     

      His licentious barons, disgusted with a vigilant government, were more

      desirous of being ruled by young princes, ignorant of public affairs,

      remiss in their conduct, and profuse in their grants; and as the king had

      insured to his sons the succession to every particular province of his

      dominions, the nobles dreaded no danger in adhering to those who, they

      knew, must some time become their sovereigns. Prompted by these motives,

      many of the Norman nobility had deserted to his son Henry; the Breton and

      Gascon barons seemed equally disposed to embrace the quarrel of Geoffrey

      and Richard. Disaffection had crept in among the English; and the earls of

      Leicester and Chester in particular had openly declared against the king.

      Twenty thousand BrabanÃ§ons, therefore, joined to some troops which he

      brought over from Ireland, and a few barons of approved fidelity, formed

      the sole force with which he intended to resist his enemies.

     

      Lewis, in order to bind the confederates in a closer union, summoned at

      Paris an assembly of the chief vassals of the crown, received their

      approbation of his measures, and engaged them by oath to adhere to the

      cause of young Henry. This prince, in return, bound himself by a like tie

      never to desert his French allies; and having made a new great seal, he

      lavishly distributed among them many considerable parts of those

      territories which he purposed to conquer from his father. The counts of

      Flanders, Boulogne, Blois, and Eu, partly moved by the general jealousy

      arising from Henry’s power and ambition, partly allured by the prospect of

      reaping advantage from the inconsiderate temper and the necessities of the

      young prince, declared openly in favor of the latter. William, king of

      Scotland, had also entered into this great confederacy; and a plan was

      concerted for a general invasion on different parts of the king’s

      extensive and factious dominions.

     

      Hostilities were first commenced by the counts of Flanders and Boulogne on

      the frontiers of Normandy. Those princes laid siege to Aumale, which was

      delivered into their hands by the treachery of the count of that name:

      this nobleman surrendered himself prisoner; and on pretence of thereby

      paying his ransom, opened the gates of all his other fortresses. The two

      counts next besieged and made themselves masters of Drincourt; but the

      count of Boulogne was here mortally wounded in the assault; and this

      incident put some stop to the progress of the Flemish arms.

     

      In another quarter, the king of France, being strongly assisted by his

      vassals, assembled a great army of seven thousand knights and their

      followers on horseback, and a proportionable number of infantry; carrying

      young Henry along with him he laid siege to Verneuil, which was vigorously

      defended by Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de Beauchamp, the governors. After he

      had lain a month before the place, the garrison, being straitened for

      provisions, were obliged to capitulate; and they engaged, if not relieved

      within three days, to surrender the town, and to retire into the citadel.

      On the last of these days, Henry appeared with his army upon the heights

      above Verneuil. Lewis, dreading an attack, sent the archbishop of Sens and

      the count of Blois to the English camp, and desired that next day should

      be appointed for a conference, in order to establish a general peace, and

      terminate the difference between Henry and his sons. The king, who

      passionately desired this accommodation, and suspected no fraud, gave his

      consent; but Lewis, that morning, obliging the garrison to surrender,

      according to the capitulation, set fire to the place, and began to retire

      with his army. Henry, provoked at this artifice, attacked the rear with

      vigor, put them to rout, did some execution, and took several prisoners.

      The French army, as their time of service was now expired, immediately

      dispersed themselves into their several provinces, and left Henry free to

      prosecute his advantages against his other enemies.

     

      The nobles of Brittany, instigated by the earl of Chester and Ralph de

      Fougeres, were all in arms; but their progress was checked by a body of

      BrabanÃ§ons, which the king, after Lewis’s retreat, had sent against them.

      The two armies came to an action near Dol, where the rebels were defeated,

      fifteen hundred killed on the spot, and the leaders, the earls of Chester

      and Fougeres, obliged to take shelter in the town of Dol. Henry hastened

      to form the siege of that place, and carried on the attack with such

      ardor, that he obliged the governor and garrison to surrender themselves

      prisoners. By these rigorous measures and happy successes, the

      insurrections were entirely quelled in Brittany; and the king, thus

      fortunate in all quarters, willingly agreed to a conference with Lewis, in

      hopes that his enemies, finding all their mighty efforts entirely

      frustrated, would terminate hostilities on some moderate and reasonable

      conditions.

     

      The two monarchs met between Trie and Gisofs; and Henry had here the

      mortification to see his three sons in the retinue of his mortal enemy. As

      Lewis had no other pretence for war than supporting the claims of the

      young princes, the king made them such offers as children might be ashamed

      to insist on, and could be extorted from him by nothing but his parental

      affection, or by the present necessity of his affairs.[*] He insisted only

      on retaining the sovereign authority in all his dominions; but offered

      young Henry half the revenues of England, with some places of surety in

      that kingdom; or, if he rather chose to reside in Normandy, half the

      revenues of that duchy, with all those of Anjou. He made a like offer to

      Richard in Guienne; he promised to resign Brittany to Geoffrey; and if

      these concessions were not deemed sufficient, he agreed to add to them

      whatever the pope’s legates, who were present, should require of him.[**]

      The earl of Leicester was also present at the negotiation; and either from

      the impetuosity of his temper, or from a view of abruptly breaking off a

      conference which must cover the allies with confusion, he gave vent to the

      most violent reproaches against Henry, and he even put his hand to his

      sword, as if he meant to attempt some violence against him. This furious

      action threw the whole company into confusion, and put an end to the

      treaty.[***]

     

      The chief hopes of Henry’s enemies seemed now to depend oft the state of

      affairs in England, where his authority was exposed to the most imminent

      danger. One article of Prince Henry’s agreement with his foreign

      confederates was, that he should resign Kent, with Dover, and all its

      other fortresses, into the hands of ihe earl of Flanders:[****] yet so

      little national or public spirit prevailed among the independent English

      nobility, so wholly bent were they on the aggrandizement each of himself

      and his own family, that, notwithstanding this pernicious concession,

      which must have produced the ruin of the kingdom, the greater part of them

      had conspired to make an insurrection, and to support the prince’s

      pretensions.

     

      The king’s principal resource lay in the church and the bishops with whom

      he was now in perfect agreement; whether that the decency of their

      character made them ashamed of supporting so unnatural a rebellion, or

      that they were entirely satisfied with Henry’s atonement for the murder of

      Becket and for his former invasion of ecclesiastical immunities. That

      prince, however, had resigned none of the essential rights of his crown in

      the accommodation: he maintained still the same prudent jealousy of the

      court of Rome; admitted no legate into England, without his swearing to

      attempt nothing against the royal prerogatives; and he had even obliged

      the monks of Canterbury, who pretended to a free election on the vacancy

      made by the death of Becket, to choose Roger, prior of Dover, in the place

      of that turbulent prelate.[*]

     

      The king of Scotland made an irruption into Northumberland, and committed

      great devastations; but being opposed by Richard de Lucy, whom Henry had

      left guardian of the realm, he retreated into his own country, and agreed

      to a cessation of arms. This truce enabled the guardian to march

      southwards with his army, in order to oppose an invasion which the earl of

      Leicester, at the head of a great body of Flemings, had made upon Suffolk.

      The Flemings had been joined by Hugh Bigod, who made them masters of his

      castle of Framlingham; and marching into the heart of the kingdom, where

      they hoped to be supported by Leicester’s vassals, they were met by Lucy,

      who, assisted by Humphry Bohun, the constable, and the earls of Arundel,

      Glocester, and Cornwall, had advanced to Farnham with a less numerous, but

      braver army to oppose them. The Flemings, who were mostly weavers and

      artificers, (for manufactures were now beginning to be established in

      Flanders,) were broken in an instant, ten thousand of them were put to the

      sword, the earl of Leicester was taken prisoner, and the remains of the

      invaders were glad to compound for a safe retreat into their own country.

     

      1174.

     

      This great defeat did not dishearten the malecontents; who, being

      supported by the alliance of so many foreign princes, and encouraged by

      the king’s own sons, determined to persevere in their enterprise. The earl

      of Ferrars, Roger de Moubray, Archetil de Mallory, Richard de Moreville,

      Hamo de Mascie, together with many friends of the earls of Leicester and

      Chester, rose in arms: the fidelity of the earls of Clare and Glocester

      was suspected; and the guardian, though vigorously supported by Geoffrey,

      bishop of Lincoln, the king’s natural son by the fair Rosamond, found it

      difficult to defend himself, on all quarters, from so many open and

      concealed enemies. The more to augment the confusion, the king of

      Scotland, on the expiration of the truce, broke into the northern

      provinces with a great army[*] of eighty thousand men; which, though

      undisciplined and disorderly, and better fitted for committing

      devastation, than for executing any military enterprise, was become

      dangerous from the present factious and turbulent spirit of the kingdom.

     

      Henry, who had baffled all his enemies in France, and had put his

      frontiers in a posture of defence, now found England the seat of danger;

      and he determined by his presence to overawe the malecontents, or by his

      conduct and courage to subdue them. He lauded at Southampton; and knowing

      the influence of superstition over the minds of the people, he hastened to

      Canterbury, in order to make atonement to the ashes of Thomas Ã  Becket,

      and tender his submissions to a dead enemy. As soon as he came within

      sight of the church of Canterbury, he dismounted walked barefoot towards

      it, prostrated himself before the shrine of the saint, remained in fasting

      and prayer during a whole day, and watched all night the holy relics. Not

      content with this hypocritical devotion towards a man whose violence and

      ingratitude had so long disquieted his government, and had been the object

      of his most inveterate animosity, he submitted to a penance still more

      singular and humiliating. He assembled a chapter of the monks, disrobed

      himself before them, put a scourge of discipline into the hands of each,

      and presented his bare shoulders to the lashes which these ecclesiastics

      successively inflicted upon him. Next day he received absolution; and,

      departing for London, got soon after the agreeable intelligence of a great

      victory which his generals had obtained over the Scots, and which, being

      gained, as was reported, on the very day of his absolution, was regarded

      as the earnest of his final reconciliation with Heaven and with Thomas a

      Becket William, king of Scots, though repulsed before the castle of

      Prudhow, and other fortified places, had committed the most horrible

      depredations upon the northern provinces; but on the approach of Ralph de

      Glanville, the famous justiciary, seconded by Bernard de Baliol, Robert de

      Stuteville, Odonel de Umfreville, William de Vesci, and other northern

      barons together with the gallant bishop of Lincoln, he thought proper to

      retreat nearer his own country, and he fixed his camp at Alnwick. He had

      here weakened his army extremely, by sending out numerous detachments in

      order to extend his ravages; and he lay absolutely safe, as he imagined,

      from any attack of the enemy. But Glanville, informed of his situation,

      made a hasty and fatiguing march to Newcastle; and allowing his soldiers

      only a small interval for refreshment, he immediately set out towards

      evening for Alnwick. He marched that night above thirty miles; arrived in

      the morning, under cover of a mist, near the Scottish camp; and regardless

      of the great numbers of the enemy, he began the attack with his small but

      determined body of cavalry. William was living in such supine security

      that he took the English at first for a body of his own ravagers who were

      returning to the camp; but the sight of their banners convincing him of

      his mistake, he entered on the action with no greater body than a hundred

      horse, in confidence that the numerous army which surrounded him would

      soon hasten to his relief. He was dismounted on the first shock, and taken

      prisoner; while his troops, hearing of this disaster, fled on all sides

      with the utmost precipitation. The dispersed ravagers made the best of

      their way to their own country; and discord arising among them, they

      proceeded even to mutual hostilities, and suffered more from each other’s

      sword than from that of the enemy.

     

      This great and important victory proved at last decisive in favor of

      Henry, and entirely broke the spirit of the English rebels. The bishop of

      Durham, who was preparing to revolt, made his submissions; Hugh Bigod,

      though he had received a strong reÃ©nforcement of Flemings, was obliged to

      surrender all his castles, and throw himself on the king’s mercy; no

      better resource was left to the earl of Ferrars and Roger de Moubray; the

      inferior rebels imitating the example, all England was restored to

      tranquillity in a few weeks; and as the king appeared to be under the

      immediate protection of Heaven, it was deemed impious any longer to resist

      him. The clergy exalted anew the merits and powerful intercession of

      Becket; and Henry, instead of opposing this superstition, plumed himself

      on the new friendship of the-saint, and propagated an opinion which was so

      favorable to his interests.[*]

     

      Prince Henry, who was ready to embark at Gravelines with the earl of

      Flanders and a great army, hearing that his partisans in England were

      suppressed, abandoned all thoughts of the enterprise, and joined the camp

      of Lewis, who, during the absence of the king, had made an irruption into

      Normandy and had laid siege to Rouen.[*] The place was defended with great

      vigor by the inhabitants;[**] and Lewis, despairing of success by open

      force, tried to gain the town by a stratagem, which, in that superstitious

      age, was deemed not very honor able. He proclaimed in his own camp a

      cessation of arms on pretence of celebrating the festival of St. Laurence;

      and when the citizens, supposing themselves in safety, were so imprudent

      as to remit their guard, he purposed to take advantage of their security.

      Happily, some priests had, from mere curiosity, mounted a steeple, where

      the alarm bell hung; and observing the French camp in motion, they

      immediately rang the bell, and gave warning to the inhabitants, who ran to

      their several stations. The French, who, on hearing the alarm hurried to

      the assault, had already mounted the walls in several places; but being

      repulsed by the enraged citizens were obliged to retreat with considerable

      loss.[***] Next day, Henry, who had hastened to the defence of his Norman

      dominions, passed over the bridge in triumph; and entered Rouen in sight

      of the French army. The city was now in absolute safety; and the king, in

      order to brave the French, monarch, commanded the gates, which had been

      walled up, to be opened; and he prepared to push his advantages against

      the enemy. Lewis saved himself from this perilous situation by a new piece

      of deceit, not so justifiable. He proposed a conference for adjusting the

      terms of a general peace, which he knew would be greedily embraced by

      Henry; and while the king of England trusted to the execution of his

      promise, he made a retreat with his army into France.

     

      There was, however, a necessity on both sides for an accommodation. Henry

      could no longer bear to see his three sons in the hands of his enemy; and

      Lewis dreaded lest this great monarch, victorious in all quarters, crowned

      with glory, and absolute master of his dominions, might take revenge for

      the many dangers and disquietudes which the arms, and still more the

      intrigues, of France had, in his disputes both with Becket and his sons,

      found means to raise him. After making a cessation of arms, a conference

      was agreed on near Tours; where Henry granted his sons much less

      advantageous terms than he had formerly offered; and he received their

      submissions. The most material of his concessions were some pensions which

      he stipulated to pay them, and some castles which he granted them for the

      place of their residence; together with an indemnity for all their

      adherents, who were restored to their estates and honors.[*]

     

      Of all those who had embraced the cause of the young princes, William,

      king of Scotland, was the only considerable loser by that invidious and

      unjust enterprise. Henry delivered from confinement, without exacting any

      ransom, about nine hundred knights, whom he had taken prisoners; but it

      cost William the ancient independency of his crown as the price of his

      liberty. He stipulated to do homage to Henry for Scotland and all his

      other possessions; he engaged that all the barons and nobility of his

      kingdom should also do homage; that the bishops should take an oath of

      fealty; that both should swear to adhere to the king of England against

      their native prince, if the latter should break his engagements; and that

      the fortresses of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, Roxborough, and Jedborough

      should be delivered into Henry’s hands, till the performance of

      articles.[**]

     

      1175.

     

      This severe and humiliating treaty was executed in its full rigor.

      William, being released, brought up all his barons, prelates, and abbots;

      and they did homage to Henry in the cathedral of York, and acknowledged

      him and his successors for their superior lord.[***]

     

      The English monarch stretched still further the rigor of the conditions

      which he exacted. He engaged the king and states of Scotland to make a

      perpetual cession of the fortresses of Berwick and Roxborough, and to

      allow the castle of Edinburgh to remain in his hands for a limited time

      This was the first great ascendant which England obtained over Scotland;

      and indeed the first important transaction which had passed between the

      kingdoms. Few princes have been so fortunate as to gain considerable

      advantages over their weaker neighbors with less violence and injustice

      than was practised by Henry against the king of Scots, whom he had taken

      prisoner in battle, and who had wantonly engaged in a war, in which all

      the neighbors of that prince, and even his own family, were, without

      provocation, combined against him.[*]

     

      Henry having thus, contrary to expectation, extricated himself with honor

      from a situation in which his throne was exposed to great danger, was

      employed for several years in the administration of justice, in the

      execution of the laws, and in guarding against those inconveniencies,

      which either the past convulsions of his state, or the political

      institutions of that age, unavoidably occasioned. The provisions which he

      made, show such largeness of thought as qualified him for being a

      legislator; and they were commonly calculated as well for the future as

      the present happiness of his kingdom.

     

      1176.

     

      He enacted severe penalties against robbery, murder, false coining, arson;

      and ordained that these crimes should be punished by the amputation of the

      right hand and right foot.[**] The pecuniary commutation for crimes, which

      has a false appearance of lenity, had been gradually disused; and seems to

      have been entirely abolished by the rigor of these statutes. The

      superstitious trial by water ordeal, though condemned by the church,[***]

      still subsisted; but Henry ordained, that any man accused of murder, or

      any heinous felony, by the oath of the legal knights of the county,

      should, even though acquitted by the ordeal, be obliged to abjure the

      realm.[****]

     

      All advances towards reason and good sense are slow and gradual. Henry,

      though sensible of the great absurdity attending the trial by duel or

      battle, did not venture to abolish it: he only admitted either of the

      parties to challenge a trial by an assize or jury of twelve

      freeholders.[*****]

     

      This latter method of trial seems to have been very ancient in England,

      and was fixed by the laws of King Alfred: but the barbarous and violent

      genius of the age had of late given more credit to the trial by battle,

      which had become the general method of deciding all important

      controversies. It was never abolished by law in England; and there is an

      instance of it so late as the reign of Elizabeth: but the institution

      revived by this king, being found more reasonable and more suitable to a

      civilized people, gradually prevailed over it.

     

      The partition of England into four divisions, and the appointment of

      itinerant justices to go the circuit in each division, and to decide the

      causes in the counties, was another important ordinance of this prince,

      which had a direct tendency to curb the oppressive barons, and to protect

      the inferior gentry and common people in their property.[*] Those justices

      were either prelates or considerable noblemen; who, besides carrying the

      authority of the king’s commission, were able, by the dignity of their own

      character, to give weight and credit to the laws.

     

      That there might be fewer obstacles to the execution of justice, the king

      was vigilant in demolishing all the new erected castles of the nobility,

      in England as well as in his foreign dominions; and he permitted no

      fortress to remain in the custody of those whom he found reason to

      suspect.[**]

     

      But lest the kingdom should be weakened by this demolition of the

      fortresses, the king fixed an assize of arms, by which all his subjects

      were obliged to put themselves in a situation for defending themselves and

      the realm. Every man possessed of a knight’s fee was ordained to have for

      each fee, a coat of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance; every free

      layman, possessed of goods to the value of sixteen marks, was to be armed

      in like manner; every one that possessed ten marks was obliged to have an

      iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a lance; all burgesses were to have a cap

      of iron, a lance, and a wambais; that is, a coat quilted with wool, tow,

      or such like materials.[***] It appears that archery, for which the

      English were afterwards so renowned, had not at this time become very

      common among them. The spear was the chief weapon employed in battle.

     

      The clergy and the laity were, during that age, in a strange situation

      with regard to each other, and such as may seem totally incompatible with

      a civilized, and indeed with any species of government. If a clergyman

      were guilty of murder, he could be punished by degradation only: if he

      were murdered, the murderer was exposed to nothing but excommunication and

      ecclesiastical censures; and the crime was atoned for by penances and

      submission.[*] Hence the assassins of Thomas Ã  Becket himself, though

      guilty of the most atrocious wickedness, and the most repugnant to the

      sentiments of that age, lived securely in their own houses, without being

      called to account by Henry himself, who was so much concerned, both in

      honor and interest, to punish that crime, and who professed or affected,

      on all occasions, the most extreme abhorrence of it. It was not till they

      found their presence shunned by every one as excommunicated persons, that

      they were induced to take a journey to Rome, to throw themselves at the

      feet of the pontiff, and to submit to the penances imposed upon them;

      after which, they continued to possess without molestation their honors

      and fortunes, and seem even to have recovered the countenance and good

      opinion of the public. But as the king, by the constitutions of Clarendon,

      which he endeavored still to maintain,[**] had subjected the clergy to a

      trial by the civil magistrate, it seemed but just to give them the

      protection of that power, to which they owed obedience: it was enacted,

      that the murderers of clergymen should be tried before the justiciary, in

      the presence of the bishop or his official; and besides the usual

      punishment for murder, should be subjected to a forfeiture of their

      estates, and a confiscation of their goods and chattels.[***]

     

      The king passed an equitable law, that the goods of a vassal should not be

      seized for the debt of his lord, unless the vassal be surety for the debt;

      and that the rents of vassals should be paid to the creditors of the lord,

      not to the lord himself. It is remarkable, that this law was enacted by

      the king in a council which he held at Verneuil, and which consisted of

      some prelates and barons of England, as well as some of Normandy, Poictou,

      Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany and the statute took place in all

      these last-mentioned territories,[*] though totally unconnected with each

      other;[**] a certain proof how irregular the ancient feudal government

      was, and how near the sovereigns, in some instances, approached to

      despotism, though in others they seemed scarcely to possess any authority.

      If a prince, much dreaded and revered like Henry, obtained but the

      appearance of general consent to an ordinance which was equitable and

      just, it became immediately an established law, and all his subjects

      acquiesced in it, If the prince was hated or despised; if the nobles, who

      supported him, had small influence; if the humors of the times disposed

      the people to question the justice of his ordinance; the fullest and most

      authentic assembly had no authority. Thus all was confusion and disorder;

      no regular idea of a constitution; force and violence decided every thing.

     

      The success which had attended Henry in his wars, did not much encourage

      his neighbors to form any attempt against him; and his transactions with

      them, during several years, contain little memorable. Scotland remained in

      that state of feudal subjection to which he had reduced it, and gave him

      no further inquietude. He sent over his fourth son, John, into Ireland,

      with a view of making a more complete conquest of the island; but the

      petulance and incapacity of this prince, by which he enraged the Irish

      chieftains, obliged the king soon after to recall him.[***]

     

      The king of France had fallen into an abject superstition; and was

      induced, by a devotion more sincere than that of Henry, to make a

      pilgrimage to the tomb of Becket, in order to obtain his intercession for

      the cure of Philip, his eldest son. He probably thought himself well

      entitled to the favor of that saint, on account of their ancient intimacy;

      and hoped that Becket, whom he had protected while on earth, would not

      now, when he was so highly exalted in heaven, forget his old friend and

      benefactor. The monks, sensible that their saint’s honor was concerned in

      the case, failed not to publish that Lewis’s prayers were answered, and

      that the young prince was restored to health by Becket’s intercession.

      That king himself was soon after struck with an apoplexy, which deprived

      him of his understanding: Philip though a youth of fifteen, took on him

      the administration, till his father’s death, which happened soon after,

     

      1180.

     

      opened his way to the throne; and he proved the ablest and greatest

      monarch that had governed that kingdom since the age of Charlemagne. The

      superior years, however, and experience of Henry, while they moderated his

      ambition, gave him such an ascendant over this prince, that no dangerous

      rivalship for a long time arose between them. The English monarch, instead

      of taking advantage of his own situation, rather employed his good offices

      in composing the quarrels which arose in the royal family of France; and

      he was successful in mediating a reconciliation between Philip and his

      mother and uncles. These services were but ill requited by Philip, who,

      when he came to man’s estate, fomented all the domestic discords in the

      royal family of England, and encouraged Henry’s sons in their ungrateful

      and undutiful behavior towards him. Prince Henry, equally impatient of

      obtaining power, and incapable of using it, renewed to the king the demand

      of his resigning Normandy; and on meeting with a refusal, he fled with his

      consort to the court of France: but not finding Philip at that time

      disposed to enter into war for his sake, he accepted of his father’s

      offers of reconciliation, and made him submissions. It was a cruel

      circumstance in the king’s fortune, that he could hope for no tranquillity

      from the criminal enterprises of his sons but by their mutual discord and

      animosities, which disturbed his family and threw his state into

      convulsions. Richard, whom he had made master of Guienne, and who had

      displayed his valor and military genius by suppressing the revolts of his

      mutinous barons refused to obey Henry’s orders, in doing homage to his

      elder brother for that duchy; and he defended himself against young Henry

      and Geoffrey, who, uniting their arms, carried war into his

      territories.[**]

     

      The king with some difficulty composed this difference; but immediately

      found his eldest son engaged in conspiracies, and ready to take arms

      against himself. While the young prince was conducting these criminal

      intrigues, he was seized with a fever at Martel,

     

      1183.

     

      a castle near Turenne to which he had retired in discontent; and seeing

      the approaches of death, he was at last struck with remorse for his

      undutiful behavior towards his father. He sent a message to the king, who

      was not far distant; expressed his contrition for his faults; and

      entreated the favor of a visit, that he might at least die with the

      satisfaction of having obtained his forgiveness. Henry, who had so often

      experienced the prince’s ingratitude and violence, apprehended that his

      sickness was entirely feigned, and he durst not intrust himself into his

      son’s hands: but when he soon after received intelligence of young Henry’s

      death, and the proofs, of his sincere repentance, this good prince was

      affected with the deepest sorrow; he thrice fainted away; he accused his

      own hard hearted ness in refusing the dying request of his son; and he

      lamented that he had deprived that prince of the last opportunity of

      making atonement for his offences, and of pouring out his soul in the

      bosom of his reconciled father.[*] This prince died in the twenty-eighth

      year of his age.

     

      The behavior of his surviving children did not tend to give the king any

      consolation for the loss. As Prince Henry had left no posterity, Richard

      was become heir to all his dominions; and the king intended that John, his

      third surviving son and favorite, should inherit Guienne as his appanage;

      but Richard refused his consent, fled into that duchy, and even made

      preparations for carrying on war, as well against his father as against

      his brother Geoffrey, who was now put in possession of Brittany. Henry

      sent for Eleanor, his queen, the heiress of Guienne, and required Richard

      to deliver up to her the dominion of these territories; which that prince,

      either dreading an insurrection of the Gascons in her favor, or retaining

      some sense of duty towards her, readily performed; and he peaceably

      returned to his father’s court. No sooner was this quarrel accommodated,

      than Geoffrey, the most vicious perhaps of all Henry’s unhappy family,

      broke out into violence; demanded Anjou to be annexed to his dominions of

      Brittany; and on meeting with a refusal, fled to the court of France, and

      levied forces against his father.[**]

     

      1185.

     

      Henry was freed from this danger by his son’s death who was killed in a

      tournament at Paris.[***]

     

      The widow of Geoffrey, soon after his decease, was delivered of a son who

      received the name of Arthur, and was invested in the duchy of Brittany,

      under the guardianship of his grandfather, who, is duke of Normandy, was

      also superior lord of that territory. Philip, as lord paramount, disputed

      some time his title to this wardship; but was obliged to yield to the

      inclinations of the Bretons, who preferred the government of Henry.

     

      But the rivalship between these potent princes, and all their inferior

      interests, seemed now to have given place to the general passion for the

      relief of the Holy Land and the expulsion of the Saracens. Those infidels,

      though obliged to yield to the immense inundation of Christians in the

      first crusade, had recovered courage after the torrent was past; and

      attacking on all quarters the settlements of the Europeans, had Deduced

      these adventurers to great difficulties, and obliged them to apply again

      for succors from the west. A second crusade, under the emperor Conrade,

      and Lewis VII., king of France, in which there perished above two hundred

      thousand men, brought them but a temporary relief; and those princes,

      after losing such immense armies, and seeing the flower of their nobility

      fall by their side, returned with little honor into Europe. But these

      repeated misfortunes, which drained the western world of its people and

      treasure, were not yet sufficient to cure men of their passion for those

      spiritual adventures; and a new incident rekindled with fresh fury the

      zeal of the ecclesiastics and military adventurers among the Latin

      Christians. Saladin, a prince of great generosity, bravery, and conduct,

      having fixed himself on the throne of Egypt, began to extend his conquests

      over the East; and finding the settlement of the Christians in Palestine

      an invincible obstacle to the progress of his arms, he bent the whole

      force of his policy and valor to subdue that small and barren, but

      important territory. Taking advantage of dissensions which prevailed among

      the champions of the cross, and having secretly gained the count of

      Tripoli, who commanded their armies, he invaded the frontiers with a

      mighty power and, aided by the treachery of that count, gained over them

      at Tiberiade a complete victory, which utterly annihilated the force of

      the already languishing kingdom of Jerusalem

     

      1187.

     

      The holy city itself fell into his hands after a feeble resistance; the

      kingdom of Antioch was almost entirely subdued and except some maritime

      towns, nothing considerable remained of thope boasted conquests, which,

      near a century before, it had cost the efforts of all Europe to acquire.

     

      The western Christians were astonished on receiving this dismal

      intelligence. Pope Urban III., it is pretended, died of grief; and his

      successor, Gregory VIII., employed the whole time of his short pontificate

      in rousing to arms all the Christians who acknowledged his authority. The

      general cry was, that they were unworthy of enjoying any inheritance in

      heaven, who did not vindicate from the dominion of the infidels the

      inheritance of God on earth, and deliver from slavery that country which

      had been consecrated by the foot-steps of their Redeemer.

     

      1188.

     

      William, archbishop of Tyre, having procured a conference between Henry

      and Philip near Gisors, enforced all these topics; gave a pathetic

      description of the miserable state of the eastern Christians; and employed

      every argument to excite the ruling passions of the age, superstition, and

      jealousy of military honor. The two monarchs immediately took the cross;

      many of their most considerable vassals imitated the example; and as the

      emperor Frederic I. entered into the same confederacy, some well-grounded

      hopes of success were entertained; and men flattered themselves that an

      enterprise, which had failed under the conduct of many independent

      leaders, or of imprudent princes, might at last, by the efforts of such

      potent and able monarchs, be brought to a happy issue.

     

      The kings of France and England imposed a tax, amounting to the tenth of

      all movable goods, on such as remained at home; but as they exempted from

      this burden most of the regular clergy, the secular aspired to the same

      immunity; pretended that their duty obliged them to assist the crusade

      with their prayers alone; and it was with some difficulty they were

      constrained to desist from an opposition, which in them who had been the

      chief promoters of those pious enterprises, appeared with the worst grace

      imaginable. This backwardness of the clergy is perhaps a symptom that the

      enthusiastic ardor which had at first seized the people for crusades, was

      now by time and ill success considerably abated; and that the frenzy was

      chiefly supported by the military genius and love of glory in the

      monarchs.

     

      But before this great machine could be put in motion, there were still

      many obstacles to surmount. Philip, jealous of Henry’s power, entered into

      a private confederacy with young Richard; and working on his ambitious and

      impatient temper, persuaded him, instead of supporting and aggrandizing

      that monarchy which he was one day to inherit, to seek present power and

      independence by disturbing and dismembering it.

     

      1189.

     

      In order to give a pretence for hostilities between the two kings, Richard

      broke into the territories of Raymond, count of Toulouse, who immediately

      carried complaints of this violence before the king of France, as his

      superior lord. Philip remonstrated with Henry; but received for answer,

      that Richard had confessed to the archbishop of Dublin, that his

      enterprise against Raymond had been undertaken by the approbation of

      Philip himself, and was conducted by his authority. The king of France,

      who might have been covered with shame and confusion by this detection,

      still prosecuted his design, and invaded the provinces of Berri and

      Auvergne, under color of revenging the quarrel of the count of Toulouse.

      Henry retaliated by making inroads upon the frontiers of France and

      burning Dreux. As this war, which destroyed all hopes of success in the

      projected crusade, gave great scandal, the two kings held a conference at

      the accustomed place between Gisors and Trie, in order to find means of

      accommodating their differences; they separated on worse terms than

      before; and Philip, to show his disgust, ordered a great elm, under which

      the conferences had been usually held, to be cut down; as if he had

      renounced all desire of accommodation, and was determined to carry the war

      to extremities against the king of England. But his own vassals refused to

      serve under him in so invidious a cause; and he was obliged to come anew

      to a conference with Henry, and to offer terms of peace. These terms were

      such as entirely opened the eyes of the king of England, and fully

      convinced him of the perfidy of his son, and his secret alliance with

      Philip, of which he had before only entertained some suspicion. The king

      of France required that Richard should be crowned king of England in the

      lifetime of his father, should be invested in all his transmarine

      dominions, and should immediately espouse Alice, Philip’s sister, to whom

      he had been formerly affianced, and who had already been conducted into

      England. Henry had experienced such fatal effects, both from the crowning

      of his eldest son, and from that prince’s alliance with the royal family

      of France, that he rejected these terms; and Richard, in con sequence of

      his secret agreement with Philip, immediately revolted from him, did

      homage to the king of France for all the dominions which Henry held of

      that crown, and received the investitures, as if he had already been the

      lawful possessor. Several historians assert, that Henry himself had become

      enamored of young Alice, and mention this as an additional reason for his

      refusing these conditions; but he had so many other just and equitable

      motives for his conduct, that it is superfluous to assign a cause, which

      the great prudence and advanced age of that monarch render somewhat

      improbable.

     

      Cardinal Albano, the pope’s legate, displeased with these increasing

      obstacles to the crusade, excommunicated Richard, as the chief spring of

      discord; but the sentence of excommunication, which, when it was properly

      prepared and was zealously supported by the clergy, had often great

      influence in that age, proved entirely ineffectual in the present case.

      The chief barons of Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being attached

      to the young prince, and finding that he had now received the investiture

      from their superior lord, declared for him, and made inroads into the

      territories of such as still adhered to the king. Henry, disquieted by the

      daily revolts of his mutinous subjects, and dreading still worse effects

      from their turbulent disposition, had again recourse to papal authority;

      and engaged the cardinal Anagni, who had succeeded Albano in the

      legateship, to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his

      dominions. But Philip, who was a prince of great vigor and capacity,

      despised the menace, and told Anagni, that it belonged not to the pope to

      interpose in the temporal disputes of princes, much less in those between

      him and his rebellious vassal. He even proceeded so far as to reproach him

      with partiality, and with receiving bribes from the king of England; while

      Richard, still more outrageous, offered to draw his sword against the

      legate, and was hindered by the interposition alone of the company, from

      committing violence upon him.

     

      The king of England was now obliged to defend his dominions by arms, and

      to engage in a war with France and with his eldest son, a prince of great

      valor, on such disadvantageous terms. Ferte-Bernard fell first into the

      hands of the enemy; Mans was next taken by assault; and Henry, who had

      thrown himself into that place, escaped with some difficulty; Amboise,

      Chaumont, and ChÃ¢teau de Loire, opened their gates on the appearance of

      Philip and Richard: Tours was menaced; and the king, who had retired to

      Saumur, and had daily instances of the cowardice or infidelity of his

      governors, expected the most dismal issue to all his enterprises. While he

      was in this state of despondency, the duke of Burgundy, the earl of

      Flanders, and the archbishop of Rheims interposed with their good offices;

      and the intelligence which he received of the taking of Tours, and which

      made him fully sensible of the desperate situation of his affairs, so

      subdued his spirit, that he submitted to all the rigorous terms which,

      were imposed upon him. He agreed that Richard should marry the princess

      Alice; that that prince should receive the homage and oath of fealty of

      all his subjects both in England and his transmarine dominions; that he

      himself should pay twenty thousand marks to the king of France, as a

      compensation for the charges of the war; that his own barons should engage

      to make him observe this treaty by force, and in case of his violating it

      should promise to join Philip and Richard against him; and that all his

      vassals, who had entered into confederacy with Richard, should receive an

      indemnity for the offence.

     

      But the mortification which Henry, who had been accustomed to give the law

      in most treaties, received from these disadvantageous terms, was the least

      that he met with on this occasion. When he demanded a list of those barons

      to whom he was bound to grant a pardon for their connections with Richard,

      he was astonished to find, at the head of them, the name of his second

      son, John; who had always been his favorite, whose interests he had ever

      anxiously at heart, and who had even, on account of his ascendant over

      him, often excited the jealousy of Richard. The unhappy father, already

      overloaded with cares and sorrows, finding this last disappointment in his

      domestic tenderness, broke out into expressions of the utmost despair,

      cursed the day in which he received his miserable being, and bestowed on

      his ungrateful and undutiful children a malediction which he never could

      be prevailed on to retract. The more his heart was disposed to friendship

      and affection, the more he resented the barbarous return which his four

      sons had successively made to his parental care; and this finishing blow,

      by depriving him of every comfort in life, quite broke his spirit, and

      threw him into a lingering fever, of which he expired, at the castle of

      Chinon, near Saumur. His natural son, Geoffrey, who alone had behaved

      dutifully towards him, attended his corpse to the nunnery of Fontervrault;

      where it lay in state in the abbey church. Next day, Richard, who came to

      visit the dead body of his father, and who, notwithstanding his criminal

      conduct, was not wholly destitute of generosity, was struck with horror

      and remorse at the sight; and as the attendants observed that, at that

      very instant, blood gushed from the mouth and nostrils of the corpse, he

      exclaimed, agreeably to a vulgar superstition, that he was his father’s

      murderer; and he expressed a deep sense, though too late, of that

      undutiful behavior which had brought his parent to an untimely grave.

     

      Thus died, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and thirty-fifth of his

      reign, the greatest prince of his time for wisdom, virtue, and abilities,

      and the most powerful in the extent of dominion of all those that had ever

      filled the throne of England. His character in private, as well as in

      public life, is almost without a blemish; and he seems to have possessed

      every accomplishment, both of body and mind, which makes a man either

      estimable or amiable. He was of a middle stature, strong and well

      proportioned; his countenance was lively and engaging; his conversation

      affable and entertaining; his elocution easy, persuasive, and ever at

      command. He loved peace, but possessed both bravery and conduct in war;

      was provident without timidity; severe in the execution of justice without

      rigor; and temperate without austerity. He preserved health, and kept

      himself from corpulency, to which he was somewhat inclined, by an

      abstemious diet, and by frequent exercise, particularly hunting. When he

      could enjoy leisure, he recreated himself either in learned conversation

      or in reading; and he cultivated his natural talents by study above any

      prince of his time. His affections, as well as his enmities, were warm and

      durable; and his long experience of the ingratitude and infidelity of men

      never destroyed the natural sensibility of his temper, which disposed him

      to friendship and society. His character has been transmitted to us by

      several writers, who were his contemporaries; and it extremely resembles,

      in its most remarkable features, that of his maternal grandfather, Henry

      I.; excepting only, that ambition, which was a ruling passion in both,

      found not in the first Henry such unexceptionable means of exerting

      itself, and pushed that prince into measures which were both criminal in

      themselves, and were the cause of further crimes, from which his

      grandson’s conduct was happily exempted.

     

      This prince, like most of his predecessors of the Norman line, except

      Stephen, passed more of his time on the continent than in this island: he

      was surrounded with the English gentry and nobility when abroad: the

      French gentry and nobility attended him when he resided in England: both

      nations acted in the government as if they were the same people; and, on

      many occasions, the legislatures seem not to have been distinguished. As

      the king and all the English barons were of French extraction, the manners

      of that people acquired the ascendant, and were regarded as the models of

      imitation. All foreign improvements, therefore, such as they were, in

      literature and politeness, in laws and arts, seem now to have been, in a

      good measure, transplanted into England and that kingdom was become little

      inferior, in all the fashionable accomplishments, to any of its neighbors

      on the continent. The more homely but more sensible manners and principles

      of the Saxons, were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the

      subtilties of school philosophy: the feudal ideas of civil government, the

      Romish sentiments in religion, had taken entire possession of the people:

      by the former, the sense of submission towards princes was somewhat

      diminished in the barons; by the latter, the devoted attachment to papal

      authority was much augmented among the clergy. The Norman and other

      foreign families established in England, had now struck deep root; and

      being entirely incorporated with the people, whom at first they oppressed

      and despised, they no longer thought that they needed the protection of

      the crown for the enjoyment of their possessions, or considered their

      tenure as precarious. They aspired to the same liberty and independence

      which they saw enjoyed by their brethren on the continent, and desired to

      restrain those exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the

      necessities of war and the violence of conquest had at first obliged them

      to indulge in their monarch. That memory also of a more equal government

      under the Saxon princes, which remained with the English, diffused still

      further the spirit of liberty, and made the barons both desirous of more

      independence to themselves and willing to indulge it to the people. And it

      was not long ere this secret revolution in the sentiments of men produced,

      first violent convulsions in the state, then an evident alteration in the

      maxims of government.

     

      The history of all the preceding kings of England since the conquest,

      gives evident proofs of the disorders attending the feudal institutions;

      the licentiousness of the barons, their spirit of rebellion against the

      prince and laws, and of animosity against each other: the conduct of the

      barons in the transmarine dominions of those monarchs, afforded perhaps

      still more flagrant instances of these convulsions; and the history of

      France, during several ages, consists almost entirely of narrations of

      this nature. The cities, during the continuance of this violent

      government, could neither be very numerous nor populous; and there occur

      instances which seem to evince that, though these are always the first

      seat of law and liberty, their police was in general loose and irregular,

      and exposed to the same disorders with those by which the country was

      generally infested. It was a custom in London for great numbers, to the

      amount of a hundred or more, the sons and relations of considerable

      citizens, to form themselves into a licentious confederacy, to break into

      rich houses and plunder them, to rob and murder the passengers, and to

      commit with impunity all sorts of disorder. By these crimes it had become

      so dangerous to walk the streets by night, that the citizens durst no more

      venture abroad after sunset, than if they had been exposed to the

      incursions of a public enemy. The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been

      murdered by some of those nocturnal rioters; and the death of so eminent a

      person, which was much more regarded than that of many thousands of an

      inferior station, so provoked the king, that he swore vengeance against

      the criminals, and became thenceforth more rigorous in the execution of

      the laws.

     

      There is another instance given by historians, which proves to what a

      height such riots had proceeded, and how open these criminals were in

      committing their robberies. A band of them had attacked the house of a

      rich citizen, with an intention of plundering it; had broken through a

      stone wall with hammers and wedges; and had already entered the house

      sword in hand, when the citizen, armed cap-Ã¡-pie, and supported by his

      faithful servants, appeared in the passage to oppose them: he cut off the

      right hand of the first robber that entered, and made such stout

      resistance that his neighbors had leisure to assemble and come to his

      relief. The man who lost his hand was taken; and was tempted by the

      promise of pardon to reveal his confederates; among whom was one John

      Senex, esteemed among the richest and best-born citizens in London. He was

      convicted by the ordeal; and though he offered five hundred marks for his

      life, the king refused the money, and ordered him to be hanged. It

      appears, from a statute of Edward I., that these disorders were not

      remedied even in that reign. It was then made penal to go out at night

      after the hour of the curfew, to carry a weapon, or to walk without a

      light or lantern. It is said in the preamble to this law, that both by

      night and by day there were continual frays in the streets of London.

     

      Henry’s care in administering justice had gained him so great a

      reputation, that even foreign and distant princes made him arbiter, and

      submitted their differences to his judgment. Sanchez, king of Navarre,

      having some controversies with Alphonso, king of Castile, was contented,

      though Alphonso had married the daughter of Henry, to choose this prince

      for a referee; and they agreed each of them to consign three castles into

      neutral hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his award. Henry

      made the cause be examined before his great council, and gave a sentence,

      which was submitted to by both parties. These two Spanish kings sent each

      a stout champion to the court of England, in order to defend his cause by

      arms, in case the way of duel had been chosen by Henry.

     

      Henry so far abolished the barbarous and absurd practice of confiscating

      ships which had been wrecked on the coast, that he ordained if one man or

      animal were alive in the ship that the vessel and goods should be restored

      to the owners.

     

      The reign of Henry was remarkable also for an innovation which was

      afterwards carried further by his successors, and was attended with the

      most important consequences. This prince was disgusted with the species of

      military force which was established by the feudal institutions, and

      which, though it was extremely burdensome to the subject, yet rendered

      very little service to the sovereign. The barons, or military tenants,

      came late into the field; they were obliged to serve only forty days; they

      were unskilful and disorderly in all their operations; and they were apt

      to carry into the camp the same refractory and independent spirit to which

      they were accustomed in their civil government. Henry, therefore,

      introduced the practice of making a commutation of their military service

      for money; and he levied scutages from his baronies and knights’ fees,

      instead of requiring the personal attendance of his vassals. There is

      mention made, in the history of the exchequer, of these scutages in his

      second, fifth, and eighteenth year; and other writers give us an account

      of three more of them.[*] When the prince had thus obtained money, he made

      a contract with some of those adventurers in which Europe at that time

      abounded; they found him soldiers of the same character with themselves,

      who were bound to serve for a stipulated time: the armies were less

      numerous, but more useful, than when composed of all the military vassals

      of the crown: the feudal institutions began to relax: the kings became

      rapacious for money, on which all their power depended: the barons, seeing

      no end of exactions, sought to defend their property, and as the same

      causes had nearly the same effects in the different countries of Europe,

      the several crowns either lost or acquired authority, according to their

      different success in the contest.

     

      This prince was also the first that levied a tax on the movables or

      personal estates of his subjects, nobles as well as commons. Their zeal

      for the holy wars made them submit to this innovation; and a precedent

      being once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns, the usual

      method of supplying the necessities of the crown. The tax of danegelt, so

      generally odious to the nation, was remitted in this reign.

     

      Since we are here collecting some detached incidents, which show the

      genius of the age, and which could not so well enter into the body of our

      history, it may not be improper to mention the quarrel between Roger,

      archbishop of York, and Richard, archbishop of Canterbury. We may judge of

      the violence of military men and laymen, when ecclesiastics could proceed

      to such extremities. Cardinal Haguezun, being sent, in 1176, as legate

      into Britain, summoned an assembly of the clergy at London; and, as both

      the archbishops pretended to sit on his right hand, this question of

      precedency begat a controversy between them. The monks and retainers of

      Archbishop Richard fell upon Roger, in the presence of the cardinal and of

      the synod, threw him to the ground, trampled him under foot, and so

      bruised him with blows, that he was taken up half dead, and his life was

      with difficulty saved from their violence. The archbishop of Canterbury

      was obliged to pay a large sum of money to the legate, in order to

      suppress all complaints with regard to this enormity.

     

      We are told by Giraldus Cambrensis, that the monks and prior of St.

      Swithun threw themselves one day prostrate on the ground and in the mire

      before Henry, complaining, with many tears and much doleful lamentation,

      that the bishop of Winchester, who was also their abbot, had cut off three

      dishes from their table. “How many has he left you?” said the king. “Ten

      only,” replied the disconsolate monks. “I myself,” exclaimed the king,

      “never have more than three; and I enjoin your bishop to reduce you to the

      same number.”

      

      This king left only two legitimate sons, Richard, who succeeded him, and

      John, who inherited no territory, though his father had often intended to

      leave him a part of his extensive dominions. He was thence commonly

      denominated Lackland. Henry left three legitimate daughters; Maud, born in

      1156, and married to Henry, duke of Saxony; Eleanor, born in 1162, and

      married to Alphonso, king of Castile: Joan, born in 1165, and married to

      William, king of Sicily.

     

      Henry is said by ancient historians to have been of a very amorous

      disposition; they mention two of his natural sons by Rosamond, daughter of

      Lord Clifford; namely, Richard LongespÃ©e, or Longsword, (so called from

      the sword he usually wore,) who was afterwards married to Ela, the

      daughter and heir of the earl of Salisbury; and Geoffrey, first bishop of

      Lincoln, then archbishop of York. All the other circumstances of the story

      commonly told of that lady seem to be fabulous
