THE Scots, who began these fatal commotions, thought that they had

finished a very perilous undertaking much to their profit and reputation.

Besides the large pay voted them for lying in good quarters during a

twelvemonth, the English parliament had conferred on them a present of

three hundred thousand pounds for their brotherly assistance.[*] In the

articles of pacification, they were declared to have ever been good

subjects; and their military expeditions were approved of, as enterprises

calculated and intended for his majesty’s honor and advantage. To carry

further the triumph over their sovereign, these terms, so ignominious to

him, were ordered by a vote of parliament to be read in all churches, upon

a day of thanksgiving appointed for the national pacification;[**] all

their claims for the restriction of prerogative were agreed to be

ratified; and, what they more valued than all these advantages, they had a

near prospect of spreading the Presbyterian discipline in England and

Ireland, from the seeds which they had scattered of their religious

principles. Never did refined Athens so exult in diffusing the sciences

and liberal arts over a savage world, never did generous Rome so please

herself in the view of law and order established by her victorious arms,

as the Scots now rejoiced in communicating their barbarous zeal and

theological fervor to the neighboring nations.

 

Charles, despoiled in England of a considerable part of his authority, and

dreading still further encroachments upon him, arrived in Scotland, with

an intention of abdicating almost entirely the small share of power which

there remained to him, and of giving full satisfaction, if possible, to

his restless subjects in that kingdom.

 

The lords of articles were an ancient institution in the Scottish

parliament. They were constituted after this manner: The temporal lords

chose eight bishops: the bishops elected eight temporal lords: these

sixteen named eight commissioners of counties, and eight burgesses, and

without the previous consent of the thirty-two, who were denominated lords

of articles, no motion could be made in parliament. As the bishops were

entirely devoted to the court, it is evident, that all the lords of

articles, by necessary consequence, depended on the king’s nomination; and

the prince, besides one negative after the bills had passed through

parliament, possessed indirectly another before their introduction; a

prerogative of much greater consequence than the former. The bench of

bishops being now abolished, the parliament laid hold of the opportunity,

and totally set aside the lords of articles: and till this important point

was obtained, the nation, properly speaking, could not be said to enjoy

any regular freedom.[*]

 

It is remarkable that, notwithstanding this institution, to which there is

no parallel in England, the royal authority was always deemed much lower

in Scotland than in the former kingdom. Bacon represents it as one

advantage to be expected from the union, that the too extensive

prerogative of England would be abridged by the example of Scotland, and

the too narrow prerogative of Scotland be enlarged from the imitation of

England. The English were at that time a civilized people, and obedient to

the laws; but among the Scots it was of little consequence how the laws

were framed, or by whom voted, while the exorbitant aristocracy had it so

much in their power to prevent their regular execution.

 

The peers and commons formed only one house in the Scottish parliament:

and as it had been the practice of James, continued by Charles, to grace

English gentlemen with Scottish titles, all the determinations of

parliament, it was to be feared, would in time depend upon the prince, by

means of these votes of foreigners, who had no interest or property in the

nation. It was therefore a law deserving approbation, that no man should

be created a Scotch peer, who possessed not ten thousand marks (above five

hundred pounds) of annual rent in the kingdom.[**]

 

A law for triennial parliaments was likewise passed; and it was ordained,

that the last act of every parliament should be to appoint the time and

place for holding the parliament next ensuing.[***]

 

The king was deprived of that power formerly exercised of issuing

proclamations which enjoined obedience under the penalty of treason; a

prerogative which invested him with the whole legislative authority, even

in matters of the highest importance.[*]

 

So far was laudable: but the most fatal blow given to royal authority, and

what in a manner dethroned the prince, was the article, that no member of

the privy council, in whose hands during the king’s absence the whole

administration lay, no officer of state, none of the judges, should be

appointed but by advice and approbation of parliament. Charles even agreed

to deprive of their seats four judges who had adhered to his interests;

and their place was supplied by others more agreeable to the ruling party.

Several of the Covenanters were also sworn of the privy council. And all

the ministers of state, counsellors, and judges, were by law to hold their

places during life or good behavior.[**]

 

The king while in Scotland conformed himself entirely to the established

church, and assisted with great gravity at the long prayers and longer

sermons with which the Presbyterians endeavored to regale him. He bestowed

pensions and preferments on Henderson, Gillespy, and other popular

preachers, and practised every art to soften, if not to gain, his greatest

enemies. The earl of Argyle was created a marquis, Lord Loudon an earl,

Lesley was dignified with the title of earl of Leven.[***] His friends he

was obliged for the present to neglect and overlook: some of them were

disgusted; and his enemies were not reconciled, but ascribed all his

caresses and favors to artifice and necessity.

 

Argyle and Hamilton, being seized with an apprehension, real or pretended,

that the earl of Crawfurd and others meant to assassinate them, left the

parliament suddenly, and retired into the country; but upon invitation and

assurances, returned in a few days. This event, which had neither cause

nor effect that was visible, nor purpose, nor consequence, was commonly

denominated the incident. But though the incident had no effect In

Scotland; what was not expected, it was attended with consequences in

England. The English parliament, which was now assembled, being willing to

awaken the people’s tenderness by exciting their fears, immediately took

the alarm; as if the malignants—so they called the king’s party—had

had laid a plot at once to murder them and all the godly in both kingdoms.

They applied therefore to Essex, whom the king had left general in the

south of England; and he ordered a guard to attend them.[*]

 

But while the king was employed in pacifying the commotions in Scotland,

and was preparing to return to England, in order to apply himself to the

same salutary work in that kingdom, he received intelligence of a

dangerous rebellion broken but in Ireland, with circumstances of the

utmost horror, bloodshed, and devastation. On every side this unfortunate

prince was pursued with murmurs, discontent, faction, and civil wars, and

the fire from all quarters, even by the most independent accidents, at

once blazed up about him.

 

The great plan of James in the administration of Ireland, continued by

Charles, was, by justice and peace to reconcile that turbulent people to

the authority of laws; and, introducing art and industry among them, to

cure them of that sloth and barbarism to which they had ever been subject.

In order to serve both these purposes, and at the same time secure the

dominion of Ireland to the English crown, great colonies of British had

been carried over, and, being intermixed with the Irish, had every where

introduced a new face of things into that country. During a peace of near

forty years, the inveterate quarrels between the nations seemed, in a

great measure, to be obliterated; and though much of the landed property

forfeited by rebellion had been conferred on the new planters, a more than

equal return had been made, by their instructing the natives in tillage,

building, manufactures, and all the civilized arts of life.[**] This had

been the course of things during the successive administrations of

Chichester, Grandison, Falkland, and, above all, of Strafford. Under the

government of this latter nobleman, the pacific plans, now come to great

maturity, and forwarded by his vigor and industry, seemed to have operated

with full success, and to have bestowed at last on that savage country the

face of a European settlement.

 

After Strafford fell a victim to popular rage, the humors excited in

Ireland by that great event could not suddenly be composed, but continued

to produce the greatest innovations in the government.

 

The British Protestants transplanted into Ireland, having every moment

before their eyes all the horrors of Popery, had naturally been carried

into the opposite extreme, and had universally adopted the highest

principles and practices of the Puritans. Monarchy, as well as the

hierarchy, was become odious to them; and every method of limiting the

authority of the crown, and detaching themselves from the king of England,

was greedily adopted and pursued. They considered not, that as they

scarcely formed the sixth part of the people, and were secretly obnoxious

to the ancient inhabitants, their only method of supporting themselves was

by maintaining royal authority, and preserving a great dependence on their

mother country. The English commons, likewise, in their furious

persecution of Strafford, had overlooked the most obvious consequences;

and, while they imputed to him as a crime every discretionary act of

authority, they despoiled all succeeding governors of that power by which

alone the Irish could be retained in subjection. And so strong was the

current for popular government in all the three kingdoms, that the most

established maxims of policy were every where abandoned, in order to

gratify this ruling passion.

 

Charles, unable to resist, had been obliged to yield to the Irish, as to

the Scottish and English parliaments; and found, too, that their

encroachments still rose in proportion to his concessions. Those subsidies

which themselves had voted, they reduced, by a subsequent vote, to a

fourth part; the court of high commission was determined to be a

grievance; martial law abolished; the jurisdiction of the council

annihilated; proclamations and acts of state declared of no authority;

every order or institution which depended on monarchy was invaded; and the

prince was despoiled of all his prerogative, without the least pretext of

any violence or illegality in his administration.

 

The standing army of Ireland was usually about three thousand men; but, in

order to assist the king in suppressing the Scottish Covenanters,

Strafford had raised eight thousand more, and had incorporated with them a

thousand men drawn from the old army; a necessary expedient for bestowing

older and discipline on the new-levied soldiers. The private men in this

army were all Catholics; but the officers, both commission and

non-commission, were Protestants, and could entirely be depended on by

Charles. The English commons entertained the greatest apprehensions on

account of this army, and never ceased soliciting the king till he agreed

to break it. Nor they consent to any proposal for augmenting the standing

army to five thousand men; a number which the king deemed necessary for

retaining Ireland in obedience.

 

Charles, thinking it dangerous that eight thousand men accustomed to

idleness, and trained to the use of arms, should be dispersed among a

nation so turbulent and unsettled, agreed with the Spanish ambassador to

have them transported into Flanders, and enlisted in his master’s service.

The English commons, pretending apprehensions, lest regular bodies of

troops, disciplined in the Low Countries, should prove still more

dangerous, showed some aversion to this expedient; and the king reduced

his allowance to four thousand men. But when the Spaniards had hired ships

for transporting these troops, and the men were ready to embark, the

commons, willing to show their power, and not displeased with an

opportunity of curbing and affronting the king, prohibited every one from

furnishing vessels for that service. And thus the project formed by

Charles, of freeing the country from these men was unfortunately

disappointed.[*]

 

The old Irish remarked all these false steps of the English, and resolved

to take advantage of them. Though their animosity against that nation, for

want of an occasion to exert itself, seemed to be extinguished, it was

only composed into a temporary and deceitful tranquillity.[**] Their

interests, both with regard to property and religion, secretly stimulated

them to a revolt. No individual of any sept, according to the ancient

customs, had the property of any particular estate; but as the whole sept

had a title to a whole territory, they ignorantly preferred this barbarous

community before the more secure and narrower possessions assigned them by

the English. An indulgence, amounting almost to a toleration, had been

given to the Catholic religion: but so long as the churches and the

ecclesiastical revenues were kept from the priests, and they were obliged

to endure the neighborhood of profane heretics, being themselves

discontented, they continually endeavored to retard any cordial

reconciliation between the English and the Irish nations.

 

There was a gentleman called Roger More, who, though of a narrow fortune,

was descended from an ancient Irish family and was much celebrated among

his countrymen for valor and capacity. This man first formed the project

of expelling the English, and asserting the independency of his native

country.[*]

 

He secretly went from chieftain to chieftain, and roused up every latent

principle of discontent. He maintained a close correspondence with Lord

Maguire and Sir Phelim O’Neale, the most powerful of the old Irish. By

conversation, by letters, by his emissaries, he represented to his

countrymen the motives of a revolt. He observed to them, that, by the

rebellion of the Scots, and factions of the English, the king’s authority

in Britain was reduced to so low a condition, that he never could exert

himself with any vigor in maintaining the English dominion over Ireland:

that the Catholics in the Irish house of commons, assisted by the

Protestants, had so diminished the royal prerogative and the power of the

lieutenant, as would much facilitate the conducting to its desired effect

any conspiracy or combination which could be formed: that the Scots,

having so successfully thrown off dependence on the crown of England, and

assumed the government into their own hands, had set an example to the

Irish, who had so much greater oppressions to complain of: that the

English planters, who had expelled them their possessions, suppressed

their religion, and bereaved them of their liberties were but a handful in

comparison of the natives: that they lived in the most supine security,

interspersed with their numerous enemies, trusting to the protection of a

small army, which was itself scattered in inconsiderable divisions through

out the whole kingdom: that a great body of men, disciplined by the

government, were now thrown loose, and were ready for any daring or

desperate enterprise: that though the Catholics had hitherto enjoyed, in

some tolerable measure, the exercise of their religion, from the

moderation of their indulgent prince, they must henceforth expect that the

government will be conducted by other maxims and other principles: that

the Puritanical parliament, having at length subdued their sovereign,

would no doubt, as soon as they had consolidated their authority, extend

their ambitious enterprises to Ireland, and make the Catholics in that

kingdom feel the same furious persecution, to which their brethren in

England were at present exposed: and that a revolt in the Irish, tending

only to vindicate their native liberty against the violence of foreign

invaders, could never at any time be deemed rebellion, much less during

the present confusions, when their prince was in a manner a prisoner, and

obedience must be paid, not to him, but to those who had traitorously

usurped his lawful authority.[*]

 

By these considerations, More engaged all the heads of the native Irish

into the conspiracy. The English of the pale, as they were called, or the

old English planters, being all Catholics, it was hoped would afterwards

join the party which restored their religion to its ancient splendor and

authority. The intention was, that Sir Phelim O’Neale and the other

conspirators should begin an insurrection on one day throughout the

provinces, and should attack all the English settlements; and that, on the

same day, Lord Maguire and Roger More should surprise the Castle of

Dublin. The commencement of the revolt was fixed on the approach of

winter, that there might be more difficulty in transporting forces from

England. Succors to themselves and supplies of arms they expected from

France, in consequence of a promise made them by Cardinal Richelieu. And

many Irish officers, who served in the Spanish troops, had engaged to join

them, as soon as they saw an insurrection entered upon by their Catholic

brethren. News, which every day arrived from England, of the fury

expressed by the commons against all Papists, struck fresh terror into the

Irish nation, and both stimulated the conspirators to execute their fatal

purpose, and gave them assured hopes of the concurrence of all their

country men.[**]

 

Such propensity to a revolt was discovered in all the Irish, that it was

deemed unnecessary, as it was dangerous to intrust the secret to many

hands; and the appointed day drew nigh, nor had any discovery been yet

made to the government. The king, indeed, had received information from

his ambassadors, that something was in agitation among the Irish in

foreign parts; but though he gave warning to the administration in

Ireland, the intelligence was entirely neglected.[***]

 

Secret rumors likewise were heard of some approaching conspiracy; but no

attention was paid to them. The earl of Leicester, whom the king had

appointed lieutenant, remained in London, The two justices, Sir William

Parsons and Sir John Borlace, were men of small abilities; and, by an

inconvenience common to all factious times, owed their advancement to

nothing but their zeal for the party by whom every thing was now governed.

Tranquil from their ignorance and inexperience, these men indulged

themselves in the most profound repose, on the very brink of destruction.

 

But they were awakened from their security on the very day before that

which was appointed for the commencement of hostilities. The Castle of

Dublin, by which the capital was commanded, contained arms for ten

thousand men, with thirty-five pieces of cannon, and a proportionable

quantity of ammunition; yet was this important place guarded, and that too

without any care, by no greater force than fifty men. Maguire and More

were already in town with a numerous band of their partisans; others were

expected that night and next morning they were to enter upon what they

esteemed the easiest of all enterprises, the surprisal of the castle.

O’Conolly, an Irishman, but a Protestant, betrayed the conspiracy to

Parsons.[*] The justices and council fled immediately for safety into the

castle, and reÃ«nforced the guards. The alarm was conveyed to the city, and

all the Protestants prepared for defence. More escaped; Maguire was taken;

and Mahone, one of the conspirators, being likewise seized, first

discovered to the justices the project of a general insurrection, and

redoubled the apprehensions which already were universally diffused

throughout Dublin.[**]

 

But though O’Conolly’s discovery saved the castle from a surprise, the

confession extorted from Mahone came too late to prevent the intended

insurrection. O’Neale and his Confederates had already taken arms in

Ulster. The Irish, every where intermingled with the English, needed but a

hint from their leaders and priests to begin hostilities against a people

whom they hated on account of their religion, and envied for their riches

and prosperity.[***]

 

The houses, cattle, goods, of the unwary English were first seized. Those

who heard of the commotions in their neighborhood, instead of deserting

their habitations, and assembling for mutual protection, remained at home

in hopes of defending their property, and fell thus separately into the

hands of their enemies.[*] After rapacity had fully exerted itself,

cruelty, and the most barbarous that ever in any nation was known or heard

of, began its operations. A universal massacre commenced of the English,

now defenceless, and passively resigned to their inhuman foes. No age, no

sex, no condition was spared. The wife weeping for her butchered husband,

and embracing her helpless children, was pierced with them, and perished

by the same stroke.[**] The old, the young, the vigorous, the infirm,

underwent a like fate, and were confounded in one common ruin. In vain did

flight save from the first assault: destruction was every where let loose,

and met the hunted victims at every turn. In vain was recourse had to

relations, to companions, to friends: all connections were dissolved, and

death was dealt by that hand from which protection was implored and

expected. Without provocation, without opposition, the astonished English,

living in profound peace and full security were massacred by their nearest

neighbors, with whom they had long upheld a continued intercourse of

kindness and good offices.[***]

 

But death was the lightest punishment inflicted by those rebels. All the

tortures which wanton cruelty could devise all the lingering pains of

body, the anguish of mind, the agonies of despair, could not satiate

revenge excited without injury, and cruelty derived from no cause. To

enter into particulars would shock the least delicate humanity. Such

enormities, though attested by undoubted evidence, appear almost

incredible. Depraved nature, even perverted religion encouraged by the

utmost license, reach not to such a pitch of ferocity, unless the pity

inherent in human breasts be destroyed by that contagion of example which

transports men beyond all the usual motives of conduct and behavior.

 

The weaker sex themselves, naturally tender to their own sufferings, and

compassionate to those of others, here emulated their more robust

companions in the practice of every cruelty.[****] Even children, taught

by the example and encouraged by the exhortation of their parents, essayed

their feeble blows on the dead carcasses or defenceless children of the

English.[v]

 

The very avarice of the Irish was not a sufficient restraint to their

cruelty. Such was their frenzy, that the cattle which they had seized, and

by rapine made their own, yet, because they bore the name of English, were

wantonly slaughtered, or, when covered with wounds, turned loose into the

woods or deserts.[*]

 

The stately buildings or commodious habitations of the planters, as if

upbraiding the sloth and ignorance of the natives, were consumed with

fire, or laid level with the ground. And where the miserable owners, shut

up in their houses, and preparing for defence, perished in the flames,

together with their wives and children, a double triumph was afforded to

their insulting foes.[**]

 

If any where a number assembled together, and, assuming courage from

despair, were resolved to sweeten death by revenge on their assassins,

they were disarmed by capitulations and promises of safety, confirmed by

the most solemn oaths. But no sooner had they surrendered, than the

rebels, with perfidy equal to their cruelty, made them share the fate of

their unhappy countrymen.[***]

 

Others, more ingenious still in their barbarity, tempted their prisoners,

by the fond love of life, to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends,

brothers, parents; and having thus rendered them accomplices in guilt,

gave them that death which they sought to shun by deserving it.[****]

 

Amidst all these enormities, the sacred name of religion resounded on

every side; not to stop the hands of these murderers, but to enforce their

blows, and to steel their hearts against every movement of human or social

sympathy. The English, as heretics, abhorred of God and detestable to all

holy men, were marked out by the priests for slaughter; and of all

actions, to rid the world of these declared enemies to Catholic faith and

piety, was represented as the most meritorious.[v] Nature, which in that

rude people was sufficiently inclined to atrocious deeds, was further

stimulated by precept: and national prejudices empoisoned by those

aversions, more deadly and incurable, which arose from an enraged

superstition. While death finished the sufferings of each victim, the

bigoted assassins, with joy and exultation, still echoed in his expiring

ears, that these agonies were but the commencement of torments infinite

and eternal.[v*]

 

Such were the barbarities by which Sir Phelim O’Neale and the Irish in

Ulster signalized their rebellion; an event memorable in the annals of

human kind, and worthy to be held in perpetual detestation and abhorrence.

The generous nature of More was shocked at the recital of such enormous

cruelties. He flew to O’Neale’s camp; but found that his authority, which

was sufficient to excite the Irish to an insurrection, was too feeble to

restrain their inhumanity. Soon after, he abandoned a cause polluted by so

many crimes; and he retired into Flanders. Sir Phelim, recommended by the

greatness of his family, and perhaps too by the unrestrained brutality of

his nature, though without any courage or capacity, acquired the entire

ascendent over the northern rebels.[*] The English colonies were totally

annihilated in the open country of Ulster: the Scots at first met with

more favorable treatment. In order to engage them to a passive neutrality,

the Irish pretended to distinguish between the British nations; and,

claiming friendship and consanguinity with the Scots, extended not over

them the fury of their massacres. Many of them found an opportunity to fly

the country; others retired into places of security, and prepared

themselves for defence; and by this means the Scottish planters, most of

them at least, escaped with their lives.[**]

 

From Ulster the flames of rebellion diffused themselves in an instant over

the other three provinces of Ireland. In all places, death and slaughter

were not uncommon; though the Irish in these other provinces pretended to

act with moderation and humanity. But cruel and barbarous was their

humanity! Not content with expelling the English their houses, with

despoiling them of their goodly manors, with wasting their cultivated

fields, they stripped them of their very clothes, and turned them out,

naked and defenceless, to all the severities of the season.[***] The

heavens themselves, as if conspiring against that unhappy people, were

armed with cold and tempest unusual to the climate, and executed what the

merciless sword had left unfinished.[****] The roads were covered with

crowds of naked English, hastening towards Dublin and the other cities

which yet remained in the hands of their countrymen. The feeble age of

children, the tender sex of women, soon sunk under the multiplied rigors

of cold and hunger.

 

Here the husband, bidding a final adieu to his expiring family, envied

them that fate which, he himself expected so soon to share: there the son,

having long supported his aged parent, with reluctance obeyed his last

commands, and, abandoning him in this uttermost distress, reserved himself

to the hopes of avenging that death which all his efforts could not

prevent nor delay. The astonishing greatness of the calamity deprived the

sufferers of any relief from the view of companions in affliction. With

silent tears, or lamentable cries, they hurried on through the hostile

territories, and found every heart which was not steeled by native

barbarity, guarded by the more implacable furies of mistaken piety and

religion.[*]

 

The saving of Dublin preserved in Ireland the remains of the English name.

The gates of that city, though timorously opened, received the wretched

supplicants, and presented to the view a scene of human misery beyond what

any eye had ever before beheld.[**] Compassion seized the amazed

inhabitants, aggravated with the fear of like calamities; while they

observed the numerous foes, without and within, which every where

environed them, and reflected on the weak resources by which they were

themselves supported. The more vigorous of the unhappy fugitives, to the

number of three thousand, were enlisted into three regiments; the rest

were distributed into the houses; and all care was taken, by diet and

warmth, to recruit their feeble and torpid limbs. Diseases of unknown name

and species, derived from these multiplied distresses, seized many of

them, and put a speedy period to their lives: others, having now leisure

to reflect on their mighty loss of friends and fortune, cursed that being

which they had saved. Abandoning themselves to despair, refusing all

succor, they expired; without other consolation than that of receiving

among their countrymen the honors of a grave, which, to their slaughtered

companions, had been denied by the inhuman barbarians.[***]

 

By some computations, those who perished by all these cruelties are

supposed to be a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand: by the most

moderate, and probably the most reasonable account, they are made to

amount to forty thousand; if this estimation itself be not, as is usual in

such cases, somewhat exaggerated.

 

The justices ordered to Dublin all the bodies of the army which were not

surrounded by the rebels; and they assembled a force of one thousand five

hundred veterans. They soon enlisted and armed from the magazines above

four thousand men more. They despatched a body of six hundred men to throw

relief into Tredah, besieged by the Irish. But these troops, attacked by

the enemy, were seized with a panic, and were most of them put to the

sword. Their arms, falling into the hands of the Irish, supplied them with

what they most wanted.[*] The justices, willing to foment the rebel lion

in a view of profiting by the multiplied forfeitures, henceforth thought

of nothing more than providing for their own present security and that of

the capital. The earl of Ormond, their general, remonstrated against such

timid, not to say base and interested counsels; but was obliged to submit

to authority.

 

The English of the pale, who probably were not at first in the secret,

pretended to blame the insurrection, and to detest the barbarity with

which it was accompanied.[**] By their protestations and declarations,

they engaged the justices to supply them with arms, which they promised to

employ in defence of the government.[***] But in a little time, the

interests of religion were found more prevalent over them than regard and

duty to their mother country. They chose Lord Gormanstone their leader;

and, joining the old Irish, rivalled them in every act of violence towards

the English Protestants. Besides many smaller bodies dispersed over the

kingdom, the principal army of the rebels amounted to twenty thousand men,

and threatened Dublin with an immediate siege.[****]

 

Both the English and Irish rebels conspired in one imposture, with which

they seduced many of their deluded countrymen: they pretended authority

from the king and queen, but chiefly from the latter, for their

insurrection; and they affirmed, that the cause of their taking arms was

to vindicate royal prerogative, now invaded by the Puritanical

parliament.[v] Sir Phelim O’Neale, having found a royal patent in Lord

Caulfield’s house, whom he had murdered, tore off the seal, and affixed it

to a commission which he had forged for himself.[v*]

 

The king received an account of this insurrection by a messenger

despatched from the north of Ireland. He immediately communicated his

intelligence to the Scottish parliament. He expected that the mighty zeal

expressed by the Scots for the Protestant religion, would immediately

engage them to fly to its defence where it was so violently invaded; he

hoped that their horror against Popery, a religion which now appeared in

its most horrible aspect, would second all his exhortations: he had

observed with what alacrity they had twice run to arms, and assembled

troops in opposition to the rights of their sovereign: he saw with how

much greater facility they could now collect forces which had been very

lately disbanded, and which had been so long inured to military

discipline. The cries of their affrighted and distressed brethren in

Ireland, he promised himself, would powerfully incite them to send over

succors, which could arrive so quickly, and aid them with such promptitude

in this uttermost distress. But the zeal of the Scots, as is usual among

religious sects, was very feeble when not stimulated either by faction or

by interest. They now considered themselves entirely as a republic, and

made no account of the authority of their prince, which they had utterly

annihilated. Conceiving hopes from the present distresses of Ireland, they

resolved to make an advantageous bargain for the succors with which they

should supply their neighboring nation. And they cast their eye towards

the English parliament, with whom they were already so closely connected,

and who could alone fulfil any articles which might be agreed on. Except

despatching a small body to support the Scottish colonies in Ulster, they

would therefore go no further at present than sending commissioners to

London in order to treat with that power to whom the sovereign authority

was now in reality transferred.[*]

 

The king, too, sensible of his utter inability to subdue the Irish rebels,

found himself obliged, in this exigency, to have recourse to the English

parliament, and depend on their assistance for supply. After communicating

to them the intelligence which he had received, he informed them, that the

insurrection was not, in his opinion, the result of any rash enterprise,

but of a formed conspiracy against the crown of England. To their care and

wisdom, therefore, he said, he committed the conduct and prosecution of

the war, which, in a cause so important to national and religious

interests, must of necessity be immediately entered upon, and vigorously

pursued.[*]

 

The English parliament was now assembled, and discovered in every vote the

same dispositions in which they had separated. The exalting of their own

authority, the diminishing of the king’s, were still the objects pursued

by the majority. Every attempt which had been made to gain the popular

leaders, and by offices to attach them to the crown, had failed of

success, either for want of skill in conducting it, or by reason of the

slender preferments which it was then in the king’s power to confer. The

ambitious and enterprising patriots disdained to accept, in detail, of a

precarious power, while they deemed it so easy, by one bold and vigorous

assault, to possess themselves forever of the entire sovereignty. Sensible

that the measures which they had hitherto pursued rendered them extremely

obnoxious to the king; were many of them in themselves exceptionable; some

of them, strictly speaking, illegal; they resolved to seek their own

security, as well as greatness, by enlarging popular authority in England.

The great necessities to which the king was reduced; the violent

prejudices which generally, throughout the nation, prevailed against him;

his facility in making the most important concessions; the example of the

Scots, whose encroachments had totally subverted monarchy; all these

circumstances further instigated the commons in their invasion of royal

prerogative. And the danger to which the constitution seemed to have been

so lately exposed, persuaded many that it never could be sufficiently

secured, but by the entire abolition of that authority which had invaded

it.

 

But this project it had not been in the power, scarcely in the intention

of the popular leaders to execute, had it not been for the passion which

seized the nation for Presbyterian discipline, and for the wild enthusiasm

which at that time accompanied it. The license which the parliament had

bestowed on this spirit, by checking ecclesiastical authority; the

countenance and encouragement with which they had honored it; had already

diffused its influence to a wonderful degree; and all orders of men had

drunk deep of the intoxicating poison. In every discourse or conversation

this mode of religion entered; in all business it had a share; every

elegant pleasure or amusement it utterly annihilated; many vices or

corruptions of mind it promoted: even diseases and bodily distempers were

not totally exempted from it; and it became requisite, we are told, for

all physicians to be expert in the spiritual profession, and by

theological considerations to allay those religious terrors with which

their patients were so generally haunted. Learning itself, which tends so

much to enlarge the mind and humanize the temper, rather served on this

occasion to exalt that epidemical frenzy which prevailed. Rude as yet, and

imperfect, it supplied the dismal fanaticism with a variety of views,

founded it on some coherency of system, enriched it with different figures

of elocution; advantages with which a people totally ignorant and

barbarous had been happily unacquainted.

 

From policy, at first, and inclination, now from necessity the king

attached himself extremely to the hierarchy: for like reasons, his enemies

were determined, by one and the same effort, to overpower the church and

monarchy.

 

While the commons were in this disposition, the Irish rebellion was the

event which tended most to promote the views in which all their measures

terminated. A horror against the Papists, however innocent, they had

constantly encouraged, a terror from the conspiracies of that sect,

however improbable, they had at all times endeavored to excite. Here was

broken out a rebellion, dreadful and unexpected; accompanied with

circumstances the most detestable of which there ever was any record; and

what was the peculiar guilt of the Irish Catholics, it was no difficult

matter, in the present disposition of men’s minds, to attribute to that

whole sect, who were already so much the object of general abhorrence.

Accustomed in all invectives to join the prelatical party with the

Papists, the people immediately supposed this insurrection to be the

result of their united counsels. And when they heard that the Irish rebels

pleaded the king’s commission for all their acts of violence, bigotry,

ever credulous and malignant, assented without scruple to that gross

imposture, and loaded the unhappy prince with the whole enormity of a

contrivance so barbarous and inhuman.[*] 8
 

By the difficulties and distresses of the crown, the commons, who

possessed alone the power of supply, had aggrandized themselves; and it

seemed a peculiar happiness, that the Irish rebellion had succeeded at so

critical a juncture to the pacification of Scotland. That expression of

the king’s, by which he committed to them the care of Ireland, they

immediately laid hold of, and interpreted in the most, unlimited sense.

They had on other occasions been gradually encroaching on the executive

power of the crown, which forms its principal and most natural branch of

authority; but with regard to Ireland, they at once assumed it, fully and

entirely, as if delivered over to them by a regular gift or assignment.

And to this usurpation the king was obliged passively to submit; both

because of his inability to resist, and lest he should still more expose

himself to the reproach of favoring the progress of that odious rebellion.

 

The project of introducing further innovations in England being once

formed by the leaders among the commons, it became a necessary

consequence, that their operations with regard to Ireland should, all of

them, be considered as subordinate to the former, on whose success, when

once undertaken, their own grandeur, security, and even being, must

entirely depend. While they pretended the utmost zeal against the Irish

insurrection, they took no steps towards its suppression, but such as

likewise tended to give them the superiority in those commotions which,

they foresaw, must so soon be excited in England.[*]

 

The extreme contempt entertained for the natives in Ireland, made the

popular leaders believe that it would be easy at any time to suppress

their rebellion, and recover that kingdom: nor were they willing to lose,

by too hasty success, the advantage which that rebellion would afford them

in their projected encroachments on the prerogative. By assuming the total

management of the war, they acquired the courtship and dependence of every

one who had any connection with Ireland, or who was desirous of enlisting

in these military enterprises: they levied money under pretence of the

Irish expedition; but reserved it for purposes which concerned them more

nearly: they took arms from the king’s magazines; but still kept them with

a secret intention of employing them against himself: whatever law they

deemed necessary for aggrandizing themselves, was voted, under color of

enabling them to recover Ireland; and if Charles withheld the royal

assent, his refusal was imputed to those pernicious counsels which had at

first excited the Popish rebellion, and which still threatened total

destruction to the Protestant interest throughout all his dominions.[*]

And though no forces were for a long time sent over to Ireland, and very

little money remitted during the extreme distress of that kingdom, so

strong was the people’s attachment to the commons, that the fault was

never imputed to those pious zealots, whose votes breathed nothing but

death and destruction to the Irish rebels.

 

To make the attack on royal authority by regular approaches, it was

thought proper to frame a general remonstrance of the state of the nation;

and accordingly the committee, which at the first meeting of parliament

had been chosen for that purpose, and which had hitherto made no progress

in their work, received fresh injunctions to finish that undertaking.

 

The committee brought into the house that remonstrance which has become so

memorable, and which was soon afterwards attended with such important

consequences. It was not addressed to the king; but was openly declared to

be an appeal to the people. The harshness of the matter was equalled by

the severity of the language. It consists of many gross falsehoods,

intermingled with some evident truths: malignant insinuations are joined

to open invectives; loud complaints of the past, accompanied with jealous

prognostications of the future. Whatever unfortunate, whatever invidious,

whatever suspicious measure had been embraced by the king, from the

commencement of his reign, is insisted on and aggravated with merciless

rhetoric: the unsuccessful expeditions to Cadiz and the Isle of RhÃ© are

mentioned; the sending of ships to France for the suppression of the

Hugonots; the forced loans; the illegal confinement of men for not obeying

illegal commands; the violent dissolution of four parliaments; the

arbitrary government which always succeeded; the questioning, fining, and

imprisoning of members for their conduct in the house; the levying of

taxes without consent of the commons; the introducing of superstitious

innovations into the church, without authority of law: in short, every

thing which, either with or without reason, had given offence during the

course of fifteen years, from the accession of the king to the calling of

the present parliament. And though all these grievances had been already

redressed, and even laws enacted for future security against their return,

the praise of these advantages was ascribed, not to the king, but to the

parliament, who had extorted his consent to such salutary statutes. Their

own merits too, they asserted, towards the king, were no less eminent than

towards the people. Though they had seized his whole revenue, rendered it

totally precarious, and made even their temporary supplies be paid to

their own commissioners, who were independent of him, they pretended that

they had liberally supported him in his necessities. By an insult still

more egregious, the very giving of money to the Scots for levying war

against their sovereign, they represented as an instance of their duty

towards him. And all their grievances, they said, which amounted to no

less than a total subversion of the constitution, proceeded entirely from

the formed combination of a Popish faction, who had ever swayed the king’s

counsels, who had endeavored, by an uninterrupted effort, to introduce

their superstition into England and Scotland, and who had now at last

excited an open and bloody rebellion in Ireland.[*]

 

This remonstrance, so full of acrimony and violence, was a plain signal

for some further attacks intended on royal prerogative, and a declaration,

that the concessions already made, however important, were not to be

regarded as satisfactory. What pretensions would be advanced, how

unprecedented, how unlimited, were easily imagined; and nothing less was

foreseen, whatever ancient names might be preserved, than an abolition,

almost total, of the monarchical government of England. The opposition,

therefore, which the remonstrance met with in the house of commons was

great. For above fourteen hours the debate was warmly managed; and from

the weariness of the king’s party, which probably consisted chiefly of the

elderly people, and men of cool spirits, the vote was at last carried by a

small majority of eleven.[**] Some time after, the remonstrance was

ordered to be printed and published, without being carried up to the house

of peers for their assent and concurrence.

 

When this remonstrance was dispersed, it excited every where the same

violent controversy which attended it when introduced into the house of

commons. This parliament, said the partisans of that assembly, have at

length profited by the fatal example of their predecessors; and are

resolved, that the fabric which they have generously undertaken to wear

for the protection of liberty, shall not be left to future ages insecure

and imperfect. At the time when the petition of right, that requisite

vindication of a violated constitution, was extorted from the unwilling

prince, who but imagined that liberty was at last secured, and that the

laws would thenceforth maintain themselves in opposition to arbitrary

authority? But what was the event? A right was indeed acquired to the

people, or rather their ancient right was more exactly defined; but as the

power of invading it still remained in the prince, no sooner did an

opportunity offer, than he totally disregarded all laws and preceding

engagements, and made his will and pleasure the sole rule of government.

Those lofty ideas of monarchical authority, which he has derived from his

early education, which are united in his mind with the irresistible

illusions of self-love, which are corroborated by his mistaken principles

of religion, it is in vain to hope that, in his more advanced age, he will

sincerely renounce from any subsequent reflection or experience. Such

conversions, if ever they happen, are extremely rare; but to expect that

they will be derived from necessity, from the jealousy and resentment of

antagonists, from blame, from reproach, from opposition, must be the

result of the fondest and most blind credulity. These violences, however

necessary, are sure to irritate a prince against limitations so cruelly

imposed upon him; and each concession which he is constrained to make, is

regarded as a temporary tribute paid to faction and sedition, and is

secretly attended with a resolution of seizing every favorable opportunity

to retract it. Nor should we imagine that opportunities of that kind will

not offer in the course of human affairs. Governments, especially those of

a mixed kind, are in continual fluctuation: the humors of the people

change perpetually from one extreme to another: and no resolution can be

more wise, as well as more just, than that of employing the present

advantages against the king, who had formerly pushed much less tempting

ones to the utmost extremities against, his people and his parliament. It

is to be feared, that if the religious rage which has seized the multitude

be allowed to evaporate, they will quickly return to the ancient

ecclesiastical establishment; and with it embrace those principles of

slavery which it inculcates with such zeal on its submissive proselytes.

Those patriots who are now the public idols, may then become the objects

of general detestation; and equal shouts of joy attend their ignominious

execution, with those which second their present advantages and triumphs.

Nor ought the apprehension of such an event to be regarded in them as a

selfish consideration: in their safety is involved the security of the

laws. The patrons of the constitution cannot suffer without a fatal blow

to the constitution: and it is but justice in the public to protect, at

any hazard, those who have so generously exposed themselves to the utmost

hazard for the public interest. What though monarchy, the ancient

government of England, be impaired, during these contests, in many of its

former prerogatives: the laws will flourish the more by its decay; and it

is happy, allowing that matters are really carried beyond the bounds of

moderation, that the current at least runs towards liberty, and that the

error is on that side which is safest for the general interests of mankind

and society.

 

The best arguments of the royalists against a further attack on the

prerogative, were founded more on opposite ideas which they had formed of

the past events of this reign, than on opposite principles of government.

Some invasions, they said, and those too of moment, had undoubtedly been

made on national privileges: but were we to look for the cause of these

violences, we should never find it to consist in the wanton tyranny and

injustice of the prince, not even in his ambition or immoderate appetite

for authority. The hostilities with Spain, in which the king on his

accession found himself engaged, however imprudent and unnecessary, had

proceeded from the advice, and even importunity of the parliament; who

deserted him immediately after they had embarked him in those warlike

measures. A young prince, jealous of honor, was naturally afraid of being

foiled in his first enterprise, and had not as yet attained such maturity

of counsel, as to perceive that his greatest honor lay in preserving the

laws inviolate, and gaining the full confidence of his people. The rigor

of the subsequent parliaments had been extreme with regard to many

articles, particularly tonnage and poundage; and had reduced the king to

an absolute necessity, if he would preserve entire the royal prerogative,

of levying those duties by his own authority, and of breaking through the

forms, in order to maintain the spirit of the constitution. Having once

made so perilous a step, he was naturally induced to continue, and to

consult the public interest by imposing ship money, and other moderate

though irregular burdens and taxations. A sure proof that he had formed no

system for enslaving his people is, that the chief object of his

government has been to raise a naval, not a military force; a project

useful, honorable, nay, indispensably requisite, and, in spite of his

great necessities, brought almost to a happy conclusion. It is now full

time to free him from all these necessities, and to apply cordials and

lenitives, after those severities which have already had their full course

against him. Never was sovereign blessed with more moderation of temper,

with more justice, more humanity, more honor, or a more gentle

disposition. What pity that such a prince should so long have been

harassed with rigors, suspicions, calumnies, complaints, encroachments;

and been forced from that path, in which the rectitude of his principles

would have inclined him to have constantly trod! If some few instances are

found of violations made on the petition of right, which he himself had

granted, there is an easier and more natural way for preventing the return

of like inconveniencies, than by a total abolition of royal authority. Let

the revenue be settled, suitably to the ancient dignity and splendor of

the crown; let the public necessities be fully supplied; let the remaining

articles of prerogative be left untouched; and the king, as he has already

lost the power, will lay aside the will, of invading the constitution.

From what quarter can jealousies now arise? What further security can be

desired or expected? The king’s preceding concessions, so far from being

insufficient for public security, have rather erred on the other extreme;

and, by depriving him of all power of self-defence, are the real cause why

the commons are emboldened to raise pretensions hitherto unheard of in the

kingdom, and to subvert the whole system of the constitution. But would

they be content with moderate advantages, is it not evident that, besides

other important concessions, the present parliament may be continued, till

the government be accustomed to the new track, and every part be restored

to full harmony and concord? By the triennial act, a perpetual succession

of parliaments is established, as everlasting guardians to the laws, while

the king possesses no independent power or military force by which he can

be supported in his invasion of them. No danger remains but what is

inseparable from all free constitutions, and what forms the very essence

of their freedom; the danger of a change in the people’s disposition, and

of general disgust contracted against popular privileges To prevent such

an evil, no expedient is more proper than to contain ourselves within the

bounds of moderation, and to consider, that all extremes naturally and

infallibly beget each other. In the same manner as the past usurpations of

the crown, however excusable on account of the necessity or provocations

whence they arose, have excited an immeasurable appetite for liberty; let

us beware, lest our encroachments, by introducing anarchy, make the people

seek shelter under the peaceable and despotic rule of a monarch.

Authority, as well as liberty, is requisite to government; and is even

requisite to the support of liberty itself, by maintaining the laws, which

can alone regulate and protect it. What madness, while every thing is so

happily settled under ancient forms and institutions, now more exactly

poised and adjusted, to try the hazardous experiment of a new

constitution, and renounce the mature wisdom of our ancestors for the

crude whimseys of turbulent innovators! Besides the certain and

inconceivable mischiefs of civil war, are not the perils apparent, which

the delicate frame of liberty must inevitably sustain amidst the furious

shock of arms? Whichever side prevails, she can scarcely hope to remain

inviolate, and may suffer no less, or rather greater injuries from the

boundless pretensions of forces engaged in her cause, than from the

invasion of enraged troops enlisted on the side of monarchy.

 

The king, upon his return from Scotland, was received in London with the

shouts and acclamations of the people, and with every demonstration of

regard and affection.[*] Sir Richard Gournay, lord mayor, a man of

moderation and authority, had promoted these favorable dispositions, and

had engaged the populace, who so lately insulted the king, and who so soon

after made furious war upon him, to give him these marks of their dutiful

attachment. But all the pleasure which Charles reaped from this joyous

reception, was soon damped by the remonstrance of the commons, which was

presented him, together with a petition of a like strain. The bad counsels

which he followed are there complained of; his concurrence in the Irish

rebellion plainly insinuated; the scheme laid for the introduction of

Popery and superstition inveighed against; and, as a remedy for all these

evils, he is desired to intrust every office and command to persons in

whom his parliament should have cause to confide.[**]

 

By this phrase, which is so often repeated in all the memorials and

addresses of that time, the commons meant themselves and their adherents.

 

As soon as the remonstrance of the commons was published the king

dispersed an answer to it. In this contest, he lay under great

disadvantages. Not only the ears of the people were extremely prejudiced

against him; the best topics upon which he could justify, at least

apologize for his former conduct, were such as it was not safe or prudent

for him at this time to employ. So high was the national idolatry towards

parliaments, that to blame the past conduct of these assemblies would have

been very ill received by the generality of the people. So loud were the

complaints against regal usurpations, that had the king asserted the

prerogative of supplying, by his own authority, the deficiencies in

government arising from the obstinacy of the commons, he would have

increased the clamors with which the whole nation already resounded.

Charles, therefore, contented himself with observing in general, that even

during that period so much complained of, the people enjoyed a great

measure of happiness, not only comparatively, in respect of their

neighbors, but even in respect of those times which were justly accounted

the most fortunate. He made warm protestations of sincerity in the

reformed religion; he promised indulgence to tender consciences with

regard to the ceremonies of the church; he mentioned his great concessions

to national liberty; he blamed the infamous libels every where dispersed

against his person and the national religion; he complained of the general

reproaches thrown out in the remonstrance with regard to ill counsels,

though he had protected no minister from parliamentary justice, retained

no unpopular servant, and conferred offices on no one who enjoyed not a

high character and estimation in the public. “If, notwithstanding this,”

he adds, “any malignant party shall take heart, and be willing to

sacrifice the peace and happiness of their country to their own sinister

ends and ambition, under whatever pretence of religion and conscience; if

they shall endeavor to lessen my reputation and interest, and to weaken my

lawful power and authority; if they shall attempt, by discountenancing the

present laws, to loosen the bands of government, that all disorder and

confusion may break in upon us; I doubt not but God in his good time will

discover them to me, and that the wisdom and courage of my high court of

parliament will join with me in their suppression and punishment.”[*]

Nothing shows more evidently the hard situation in which Charles was

placed, than to observe that he was obliged to confine himself within the

limits of civility towards subjects who had transgressed all bounds of

regard, and even of good manners, in the treatment of their sovereign.

 

The first instance of those parliamentary encroachments which Charles was

now to look for, was the bill for pressing soldiers to the service of

Ireland. This bill quickly passed the lower house. In the preamble, the

king’s power of pressing, a power exercised during all former times, was

declared illegal, and contrary to the liberty of the subject. By a

necessary consequence, the prerogative, which the crown had ever assumed,

of obliging men to accept of any branch of public service, was abolished

and annihilated; a prerogative, it must be owned, not very compatible with

a limited monarchy. In order to elude this law, the king offered to raise

ten thousand volunteers for the Irish service: but the commons were afraid

lest such an army should be too much at his devotion. Charles, still

unwilling to submit to so considerable a diminution of power, came to the

house of peers, and offered to pass the law without the preamble; by which

means, he said, that ill-timed question with regard to the prerogative

would for the present be avoided, and the pretensions of each party be

left entire. Both houses took fire at this measure, which, from a similar

instance, while the bill of attainder against Strafford was in dependence,

Charles might foresee would be received with resentment. The lords, as

well as commons, passed a vote, declaring it to be a high breach of

privilege for the king to take notice of any bill which was in agitation

in either of the houses, or to express his sentiments with regard to it,

before it be presented to him for his assent in a parliamentary manner.

The king was obliged to compose all matters by an apology.[**]

 

The general question, we may observe, with regard to privileges of

parliament, has always been, and still continues, one of of the greatest

mysteries in the English constitution; and in some respects,

notwithstanding the accurate genius of that government, these privileges

are at present as undetermined as were formerly the prerogatives of the

crown. Such privileges as are founded on long precedent cannot be

controverted: but though it were certain, that former kings had not in any

instance taken notice of bills lying before the houses, (which yet appears

to have been very common,) it follows not, merely from their never

exerting such a power, that they had renounced it, or never were possessed

of it. Such privileges also as are essential to all free assemblies which

deliberate, they may be allowed to assume, whatever precedents may

prevail: but though the king’s interposition, by an offer or advice, does

in some degree overawe or restrain liberty; it may be doubted whether it

imposes such evident violence as to entitle the parliament, without any

other authority or concession, to claim the privilege of excluding it. But

this was the favorable time for extending privileges; and had none more

exorbitant or unreasonable been challenged, few bad consequences had

followed. The establishment of this rule, it is certain, contributes to

the order and regularity, as well as freedom, of parliamentary

proceedings.

 

The interposition of peers in the election of commoners was likewise about

this time declared a breach of privilege, and continues ever since to be

condemned by votes of the commons, and universally practised throughout

the nation.

 

Every measure pursued by the commons, and, still more, every attempt made

by their partisans, were full of the most inveterate hatred against the

hierarchy, and showed a determined resolution of subverting the whole

ecclesiastical establishment. Besides numberless vexations and

persecutions which the clergy underwent from the arbitrary power of the

lower house, the peers, while the king was in Scotland, having passed an

order for the observance of the laws with regard to public worship, the

commons assumed such authority, that, by a vote alone of their house, they

suspended those laws, though enacted by the whole legislature: and they

particularly forbade bowing at the name of Jesus; a practice which gave

them the highest scandal, and which was one of their capital objections

against the established religion.[*] They complained of the king’s filling

five vacant sees, and considered it as an insult upon them, that he should

complete and strengthen an order which they intended soon entirely to

abolish.[**] They had accused thirteen bishops of high treason, for

enacting canons without consent of parliament,[***] though, from the

foundation of the monarchy, no other method had ever been practised: and

they now insisted that the peers, upon this general accusation, should

sequester those bishops from their seats in parliament, and commit them to

prison.

 

Their bill for taking away the bishops’ votes had last winter been

rejected by the peers: but they again introduced the same bill, though no

prorogation had intervened; and they endeavored, by some minute

alterations, to elude that rule of parliament which opposed them. And when

they sent up this bill to the lords, they made a demand, the most absurd

in the world, that the bishops, being all of them parties, should be

refused a vote with regard to that question.[*] After the resolution was

once formed by the commons, of invading the established government of

church and state, it could not be expected that their proceedings, in such

a violent attempt, would thenceforth be altogether regular and equitable:

but it must be confessed that, in their attack on the hierarchy, they

still more openly passed all bounds of moderation; as supposing, no doubt,

that the sacredness of the cause would sufficiently atone for employing

means the most irregular and unprecedented. This principle, which prevails

so much among zealots, never displayed itself so openly as during the

transactions of this whole period.

 

But, notwithstanding these efforts of the commons, they could not expect

the concurrence of the upper house either to this law, or to any other

which they should introduce for the further limitation of royal authority.

The majority of the peers adhered to the king, and plainly foresaw the

depression of nobility, as a necessary consequence of popular usurpations

on the crown. The insolence, indeed, of the commons, and their haughty

treatment of the lords, had already risen to a great height, and gave

sufficient warning of their future attempts upon that order. They muttered

somewhat of their regret that they should be obliged to save the kingdom

alone, and that the house of peers would have no part in the honor. Nay,

they went so far as openly to tell the lords, “That they themselves were

the representative body of the whole kingdom, and that the peers were

nothing but individuals who held their seats in a particular capacity; and

therefore, if their lordships will not consent to the passing of acts

necessary for the preservation of the people, the commons, together with

such of the lords as are more sensible of the danger, must join together,

and represent the matter to his majesty.”[*] So violent was the

democratical, enthusiastic spirit diffused throughout the nation, that a

total confusion of all rank and order was justly to be apprehended; and

the wonder was, not that the majority of the nobles should seek shelter

under the throne, but that any of them should venture to desert it. But

the tide of popularity seized many, and carried them wide of the most

established maxims of civil policy. Among the opponents of the king are

ranked the earl of Northumberland, lord admiral, a man of the first family

and fortune, and endowed with that dignified pride which so well became

his rank and station: the earl of Essex, who inherited all his father’s

popularity, and having from his early youth sought renown in arms, united

to a middling capacity that rigid inflexibility of honor which forms the

proper ornament of a nobleman and a soldier: Lord Kimbolton, soon after

earl of Manchester, a person distinguished by humanity, generosity,

affability, and every amiable virtue. These men, finding that their credit

ran high with the nation, ventured to encourage those popular disorders,

which, they vainly imagined, they possessed authority sufficient to

regulate and control.

 

In order to obtain a majority in the upper house, the commons had recourse

to the populace, who on other occasions had done them such important

service. Amidst the greatest security, they affected continual fears of

destruction to themselves and the nation, and seemed to quake at every

breath or rumor of danger. They again excited the people by never-ceasing

inquiries after conspiracies, by reports of insurrections, by feigned

intelligence of invasions from abroad, by discoveries of dangerous

combinations at home among Papists and their adherents. When Charles

dismissed the guard which they had ordered during his absence, they

complained; and upon his promising them a new guard, under the command of

the earl of Lindesey, they absolutely refused the offer, an were well

pleased to insinuate, by this instance of jealousy, that their danger

chiefly arose from the king himself.[**]

 

They ordered halberts to be brought into the hall where they assembled,

and thus armed themselves against those conspiracies with which, they

pretended, they were hourly threatened. As stories of plots, however

ridiculous, were willingly attended to, and were dispersed among the

multitude, to whose capacity they were well adapted. Beale, a tailor,

informed the commons that, walking in the fields, he had hearkened to the

discourse of certain persons unknown to him, and had heard them talk of a

most dangerous conspiracy. A hundred and eight ruffians, as he learned,

had been appointed to murder a hundred and eight lords and commoners, and

were promised rewards for these assassinations, ten pounds for each lord,

forty shillings for each commoner. Upon this notable intelligence, orders

were issued for seizing priests and Jesuits, a conference was desired with

the lords, and the deputy lieutenants of some suspected counties were

ordered to put the people in a posture of defence.[*]

 

The pulpits likewise were called in aid, and resounded with the dangers

which threatened religion from the desperate attempts of Papists and

malignants. Multitudes flocked towards Westminster, and insulted the

prelates and such of the lords as adhered to the crown. The peers voted a

declaration against those tumults, and sent it to the lower house; but

these refused their concurrence.[**] Some seditious apprentices, being

seized and committed to prison, immediately received their liberty, by an

order of the commons.[***] The sheriffs and justices having appointed

constables with strong watches to guard the parliament, the commons sent

for the constables, and required them to discharge the watches, convened

the justices, voted their orders a breach of privilege, and sent one of

them to the Tower.[****]

 

Encouraged by these intimations of their pleasure, the populace crowded

about Whitehall, and threw out insolent menaces against Charles himself.

Several seduced officers and young gentlemen of the inns of court, during

this time of disorder and danger, offered their service to the king.

Between them and the populace there passed frequent skirmishes, which

ended not without bloodshed. By way of reproach, these gentlemen gave the

rabble the appellation of Roundheads, on account of the short cropped hair

which they wore: these called the others Cavaliers. And thus the nation,

which was before sufficiently provided with religious as well as civil

causes of quarrel, was also supplied with party names, under which the

factions might rendezvous and signalize their mutual hatred.[*]

 

Meanwhile the tumults still continued, and even increased about

Westminster and Whitehall. The cry incessantly resounded against “bishops

and rotten-hearted lords.”[**] The former especially, being

distinguishable by their habit, and being the object of violent hatred to

all the sectaries, were exposed to the most dangerous insults.[***]

Williams, now created archbishop of York, having been abused by the

populace, hastily called a meeting of his brethren. By his advice, a

protestation was drawn and addressed to the king and the house of lords.

The bishops there set forth, that though they had an undoubted right to

sit and vote in parliament, yet in coming thither, they had been menaced,

assaulted, affronted, by the unruly multitude, and could no longer with

safety attend their duty in the house. For this reason they protested

against all laws, votes, and resolutions, as null and invalid, which

should pass during the time of their constrained absence. This

protestation, which, though just and legal, was certainly ill-timed, was

signed by twelve bishops, and communicated to the king, who hastily

approved of it. As soon as it was presented to the lords, that house

desired a conference with the commons, whom they informed of this

unexpected protestation. The opportunity was seized with joy and triumph.

An impeachment of high treason was immediately sent up against the

bishops, as endeavoring to subvert the fundamental laws, and to invalidate

the authority of the legislature.[****] They were, on the first demand,

sequestered from parliament, and committed to custody. No man in either

house ventured to speak a word in their vindication; so much displeased

was every one at the egregious imprudence of which they had been guilty.

One person alone said, that he did not believe them guilty of high

treason; but that they were stark mad, and therefore desired they might be

sent to bedlam.[v]

 

1642.

 

A few days after, the king was betrayed into another indiscretion, much

more fatal; an indiscretion to which all the ensuing disorders and civil

wars ought immediately and directly to be ascribed; this was the

impeachment of Lord Kimbolton and the five members.

 

When the commons employed in their remonstrance language so severe and

indecent, they had not been actuated entirely by insolence and passion;

their views were more solid and profound. They considered that in a

violent attempt, such as an invasion of the ancient constitution, the more

leisure was afforded the people to reflect, the less would they be

inclined to second that rash and dangerous enterprise: that the peers

would certainly refuse their concurrence; nor were there any hopes of

prevailing on them, but by instigating the populace to tumult and

disorder: that the employing of such odious means for so invidious an end

would, at long-run, lose them all their popularity, and turn* the tide of

favor to the contrary party; and that, if the king only remained in

tranquillity, and cautiously eluded the first violence of the tempest he

would in the end certainly prevail, and be able at least to preserve the

ancient laws and constitution. They were therefore resolved, if possible,

to excite him to some violent passion, in hopes that he would commit

indiscretions of which they might make advantage.

 

It was not long before they succeeded beyond their fondest wishes. Charles

was enraged to find that all his concessions but increased their demands;

that the people who were returning to a sense of duty towards him, were

again roused to sedition and tumults; that the blackest calumnies were

propagated against him, and even the Irish massacre ascribed to his

counsels and machinations; and that a method of address was adopted not

only unsuitable towards so great a prince, but which no private gentleman

could bear without resentment. When he considered all these increasing

acts of insolence in the commons, he was apt to ascribe them in a great

measure to his own indolence and facility. The queen and the ladies of the

court further stimulated his passion, and represented that, if he exerted

the vigor and displayed the majesty of a monarch, the daring usurpations

of his subjects would shrink before him. Lord Digby, a man of fine parts

but full of levity, and hurried on by precipitate passions, suggested like

counsels; and Charles, who, though commonly moderate in his temper, was

ever disposed to hasty resolutions, gave way to the fatal importunity of

his friends and servants.[*]

 

Herbert, attorney-general, appeared in the house of peers and in his

majesty’s name entered an accusation of high treason against Lord

Kimbolton and five commoners, Hollis, Sir Arthur Hazlerig, Hambden, Pym,

and Strode. The articles were, that they had traitorously endeavored to

subvert the fundamental laws and government of the kingdom, to deprive the

king of his regal power, and to impose on his subjects an arbitrary and

tyrannical authority: that they had endeavored, by many foul aspersions on

his majesty and his government, to alienate the affections of his people,

and make him odious to them: that they had attempted to draw his late army

to disobedience of his royal commands, and to side with them in their

traitorous designs: that they had invited and encouraged a foreign power

to invade the kingdom: that they had aimed at subverting the rights and

very being of parliament: that, in order to complete their traitorous

designs, they had endeavored, as far as in them lay, by force and terror

to compel the parliament to join with them; and to that end had actually

raised and countenanced tumults against the king and parliament: and that

they had traitorously conspired to levy, and actually had levied war

against the king.[*]

 

The whole world stood amazed at this important accusation, so suddenly

entered upon without concert, deliberation, or reflection. Some of these

articles of accusation, men said, to judge by appearance, seem to be

common between the impeached members and the parliament; nor did these

persons appear any further active in the enterprises of which they were

accused, than so far as they concurred with the majority in their votes

and speeches. Though proofs might perhaps be produced of their privately

inviting the Scots to invade England, how could such an attempt be

considered as treason, after the act of oblivion which had passed, and

after that both houses, with the king’s concurrence, had voted that nation

three hundred thousand pounds for their brotherly assistance? While, the

house of peers are scarcely able to maintain their independency, or to

reject the bills sent them by the commons, will they ever be permitted by

the populace, supposing them inclined, to pass a sentence which must

totally subdue the lower house, and put an end to their ambitious

undertakings? These five members, at least Pym, Hambden and Hollis, are

the very heads of the popular party; and if these be taken off, what fate

must be expected by their followers, who are, many of them, accomplices in

the same treason? The punishment of leaders is ever the last triumph over

a broken and routed party; but surely was never before attempted, in

opposition to a faction, during the full tide of its power and success.

 

But men had not leisure to wonder at the indiscretion of this measure:

their astonishment was excited by new attempts, still more precipitate and

imprudent. A serjeant at arms, in the king’s name, demanded of the house

the five members: and was sent back without any positive answer.

Messengers were employed to search for them, and arrest them. Their

trunks, chambers, and studies were sealed and locked. The house voted all

these acts of violence to be breaches of privilege, and commanded every

one to defend the liberty of the members.[*] The king, irritated by all

this opposition, resolved next day to come in person to the house, with an

intention to demand, perhaps seize in their presence, the persons whom he

had accused.

 

This resolution was discovered to the countess of Carlisle, sister to

Northumberland, a lady of spirit, wit, and intrigue.[**] She privately

sent intelligence to the five members; and they had time to withdraw, a

moment before the king entered. He was accompanied by his ordinary

retinue, to the number of above two hundred, armed as usual, some with

halberts, some with walking swords. The king left them at the door, and he

himself advanced alone through the hall, while all the members rose to

receive him.

 

The speaker withdrew from his chair, and the king took possession of it.

The speech which he made was as follows: “Gentlemen, I am sorry for this

occasion of coming to you. Yesterday I sent a serjeant at arms to demand

some who, by my order, were accused of high treason. Instead of obedience,

I received a message. I must here declare to you, that though no king that

ever was in England could be more careful of your privileges than I shall

be, yet in cases of treason no person has privilege. Therefore am I come

to tell you, that I must have these men wheresoever I can find them. Well,

since I see all the birds are flown, I do expect that you will send them

to me as soon as they return. But I assure you, on the word of a king, I

never did intend any force, but shall proceed against them in a fair and

legal way; for I never meant any other. And now, since I see I cannot do

what I came for, I think this is no unfit occasion to repeat what I have

said formerly, that whatever I have done in favor and to the good of my

subjects, I do intend to maintain it.”[*]

 

When the king was looking around for the accused members, he asked the

speaker, who stood below, whether any of these persons were in the house.

The speaker, falling on his knee, prudently replied, “I have, sir, neither

eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place, but as the house is pleased

to direct me, whose servant I am. And I humbly ask pardon, that I cannot

give any other answer to what your majesty is pleased to demand of

me.”[**]

 

The commons were in the utmost disorder; and when the king was departing,

some members cried aloud, so as he might hear them, “Privilege!

privilege!” And the house immediately adjourned till next day.[***]

 

That evening the accused members, to show the greater apprehension,

removed into the city, which was their fortress. The citizens were the

whole night in arms. Some people, who were appointed for that purpose, or

perhaps actuated by their own terrors, ran from gate to gate, crying out

that the cavaliers were coming to burn the city, and that the king himself

was at their head.

 

Next morning, Charles sent to the mayor, and ordered him to call a common

council immediately. About ten o’clock, he himself, attended only by three

or four lords, went to Guildhall. He told the common council, that he was

sorry to hear of the apprehensions entertained of him; that he was come to

them without any guard, in order to show how much he relied on their

affections; and that he had accused certain men of high treason, against

whom he would proceed in a legal way, and therefore presumed that they

would not meet with protection in the city. After many other gracious

expressions, he told one of the sheriffs, who of the two was thought the

least inclined to his service, that he would dine with him. He departed

the hall without receiving the applause which he expected. In passing

through the streets, he heard the cry, “Privilege of parliament! privilege

of parliament!” resounding from all quarters. One of the populace, more

insolent than the rest drew nigh to his coach, and called out with a loud

voice, “To your tents, O Israel!” the words employed by the mutinous

Israelites when they abandoned Rehoboam, their rash and ill-counselled

sovereign,[*]

 

When the house of commons met, they affected the greatest dismay; and

adjourning themselves for some days, ordered a committee to sit in

Merchant Tailors Hall in the city. The committee made an exact inquiry

into all circumstances attending the king’s entry into the house: every

passionate speech, every menacing gesture of any, even the meanest of his

attendants, was recorded and aggravated. An intention of offering violence

to the parliament, of seizing the accused members in the very house, and

of murdering all who should make resistance, was inferred. And that

unparalleled breach of privilege—so it was called—was still

ascribed to the counsel of Papists and their adherents. This expression,

which then recurred every moment in speeches and memorials, and which at

present is so apt to excite laughter in the reader, begat at that time the

deepest and most real consternation throughout the kingdom.

 

A letter was pretended to be intercepted, and was communicated to the

committee, who pretended to lay great stress upon it. One Catholic there

congratulates another on the accusation of the members; and represents

that incident as a branch of the same pious contrivance which had excited

the Irish insurrection, and by which the profane heretics would soon be

exterminated in England.[**]

 

The house again met; and, after confirming the votes of their committee,

instantly adjourned, as if exposed to the most imminent perils from the

violence of their enemies. This practice they continued for some time.

When the people, by these affected panics, were wrought up to a sufficient

degree of rage and terror, it was thought proper that the accused members

should, with a triumphant and military procession, take their seats in the

house. The river was covered with boats and other vessels, laden with

small pieces of ordnance, and prepared for fight. Skippon, whom the

parliament had appointed, by their own authority, major-general of the

city militia,[*] conducted the members, at the head of this tumultuary

army, to Westminster Hall. And when the populace, by land and by water,

passed Whitehall, they still asked, with insulting shouts, “What has

become of the king and his cavaliers? And whither are they fled?”[**]

 

The king, apprehensive of danger from the enraged multitude, had retired

to Hampton Court, deserted by all the world, and overwhelmed with grief,

shame, and remorse, for the fatal measures into which he had been hurried.

His distressed situation he could no longer ascribe to the rigors of

destiny, or the malignity of enemies: his own precipitancy and

indiscretion must bear the blame of whatever disasters should henceforth

befall him. The most faithful of his adherents, between sorrow and

indignation, were confounded with reflections on what had happened, and

what was likely to follow. Seeing every prospect blasted, faction

triumphant, the discontented populace inflamed to a degree of fury, they

utterly despaired of success in a cause to whose ruin friends and enemies

seemed equally to conspire.

 

The prudence of the king, in his conduct of this affair, nobody pretended

to justify. The legality of his proceedings met with many and just

apologies, though generally offered to unwilling ears. No maxim of law, it

was said, is more established, or more universally allowed, than that

privilege of parliament extends not to treason, felony, or breach of

peace; nor has either house, during former ages, ever pretended, in any of

those cases, to interpose in behalf of its members. Though some

inconveniencies should result from the observance of this maxim, that

would not be sufficient, without other authority, to abolish a principle

established by uninterrupted precedent, and founded on the tacit consent

of the whole legislature. But what are the inconveniencies so much

dreaded? The king, on pretence of treason, may seize any members of the

opposite faction, and for a time gain to his partisans the majority of

voices. But if he seize only a few, will he not lose more friends by such

a gross artifice than he confines enemies? If he seize a great number, is

not this expedient force, open and barefaced? And what remedy at all times

against such force, but to oppose to it a force which is superior? Even

allowing that the king intended to employ violence, not authority, for

seizing the members; though at that time, and ever afterwards, he

positively asserted the contrary; yet will his conduct admit of excuse.

That the hall where the parliament assembles is an inviolable sanctuary,

was never yet pretended. And if the commons complain of the affront

offered them, by an attempt to arrest their members in their very

presence, the blame must lie entirely on themselves! who had formerly

refused compliance with the king’s message, when he peaceably demanded

these members. The sovereign is the great executor of the laws; and his

presence was here legally employed, both in order to prevent opposition,

and to protect the house against those insults which their disobedience

had so well merited.

 

Charles knew to how little purpose he should urge these reasons against

the present fury of the commons. He proposed, therefore, by a message,

that they would agree upon a legal method by which he might carry on his

prosecution against the members, lest further misunderstandings happen

with regard to privilege. They desired him to lay the grounds of

accusation before the house; and pretended that they must first judge

whether it were proper to give up their members, to a legal trial. The

king then informed them, that he would waive, for the present, all

prosecution: by successive messages he afterwards offered a pardon to the

members; offered to concur in any law that should acquit or secure them;

offered any reparation to the house for the beach of privilege, of which,

he acknowledged, they had reason to complain.[*] They were resolved to

accept of no satisfaction, unless he would discover his advisers in that

illegal measure; a condition to which, they knew that, without rendering

himself forever vile and contemptible, he could not possibly submit.

Meanwhile, they continued to thunder against the violation of

parliamentary privileges, and by their violent outcries to inflame the

whole nation. The secret reason of their displeasure, however obvious,

they carefully concealed. In the king’s accusation of the members, they

plainly saw his judgment of late parliamentary proceedings; and every

adherent of the ruling faction dreaded the same fate, should royal

authority be reÃ«stablished in its ancient lustre. By the most unhappy

conduct, Charles, while he extremely augmented in his opponents the will,

had also increased the ability of hurting him.

 

The more to excite the people, whose dispositions were already very

seditious, the expedient of petitioning was renewed. A petition from the

county of Buckingham was presented to the house by six thousand

subscribers, who promised to live and die in defence of the privileges of

parliament.[*] The city of London, the county of Essex, that of Hertford,

Surrey, Berks, imitated the example. A petition from the apprentices was

graciously received.[**] Nay, one was encouraged from the porters, whose

numbers amounted, as they said, to fifteen thousand.[***] The address of

that great body contained the same articles with all the others; the

privileges of parliament, the danger of religion, the rebellion of

Ireland, the decay of trade. The porters further desired, that justice

might be done upon offenders, as the atrociousness of their crimes had

deserved. And they added, “That if such remedies were any longer

suspended, they should be forced to extremities not fit to be named, and

make good the saying, that ‘Necessity has no law.’”[****]

 

Another petition was presented by several poor people, or beggars, in the

name of many thousands more; in which the petitioners proposed as a remedy

for the public miseries “That those noble worthies of the house of peers,

who concur with the happy votes of the commons, may separate themselves

from the rest, and sit and vote as one entire body.” The commons gave

thanks for this petition.[v]

 

The very women were seized with the same rage. A brewer’s wife, followed

by many thousands of her sex, brought a petition to the house, in which

the petitioners expressed their terror of the Papists and prelates, and

their dread of like massacres, rapes, and outrages, with those which had

been committed upon their sex in Ireland. They had been necessitated, they

said, to imitate the example of the women of Tekoah: and they claimed

equal right with the men, of declaring by petition their sense of the

public cause; because Christ had purchased them at as dear a rate, and in

the free enjoyment of Christ consists equally the happiness of both sexes.

Pym came to the door of the house; and having told the female zealots that

their petition was thankfully accepted and was presented in a seasonable

time, he begged that their prayers for the success of the commons might

follow their petition. Such low arts of popularity were affected, and by

such illiberal cant were the unhappy people incited to civil discord and

convulsions.

 

In the mean time, not only all petitions which favored the church or

monarchy, from whatever hand they came, were discouraged, but the

petitioners were sent for, imprisoned, and prosecuted as delinquents; and

this unequal conduct was openly avowed and justified. Whoever desire a

change, it was said, must express their sentiments; for how otherwise

shall they be known? But those who favor the established government in

church or state, should not petition; because they already enjoy what they

wish for.[*]

 

The king had possessed a great party in the lower house, as appeared in

the vote for the remonstrance; and this party, had every new cause of

disgust been carefully avoided, would soon have become the majority, from

the odium attending the violent measures embraced by the popular leaders.

A great majority he always possessed in the house of peers, even after the

bishops were confined or chased away; and this majority could not have

been overcome but by outrages which, in the end, would have drawn disgrace

and ruin on those who incited them. By the present fury of the people, as

by an inundation, were all these obstacles swept away, and every rampart

of royal authority laid level with the ground. The victory was pursued

with impetuosity by the sagacious commons, who knew the importance of a

favorable moment in all popular commotions. The terror of their authority

they extended over the whole nation; and all opposition, and even all

blame vented in private conversation, were treated as the most atrocious

crimes by these severe inquisitors. Scarcely was it permitted to find

fault with the conduct of any particular member, if he made a figure in

the house; and reflections thrown out on Pym were at this time treated as

breaches of privilege. The populace without doors were ready to execute,

from the least hint, the will of their leaders; nor was it safe for any

member to approach either house, who pretended to control or oppose the

general torrent. After so undisguised a manner was this violence

conducted, that Hollis, in a speech to the peers, desired to know the

names of such members as should vote contrary to the sentiments of the

commons:[**] and Pym said in the lower house, that the people must not be

restrained in the expressions of their just desires.[***]

 

By the flight, or terror, or despondency of the king’s party, an

undisputed majority remained everywhere to their opponents; and the bills

sent up by the commons, which had hitherto stopped with the peers, and

would certainly have been rejected, now passed, and were presented for the

royal assent. These were, the pressing bill with its preamble, and the

bill against the votes of the bishops in parliament. The king’s authority

was at that time reduced to the lowest ebb. The queen too, being secretly

threatened with an impeachment, and finding no resource in her husband’s

protection, was preparing to retire into Holland. The rage of the people

was, on account of her religion, as well as her spirit and activity,

universally levelled against her. Usage the most contumelious she had

hitherto borne with silent indignation. The commons, in their fury against

priests, had seized her very confessor, nor would they release him upon

her repeated applications. Even a visit of the prince to his mother had

been openly complained of, and remonstrances against it had been presented

to her.[*] Apprehensive of attacks still more violent, she was desirous of

facilitating her escape; and she prevailed with the king to pass these

bills, in hopes of appeasing for a time the rage of the multitude.[**]

 

These new concessions, however important, the king immediately found to

have no other effect than had all the preceding ones: they were made the

foundation of demands still more exorbitant. From the facility of his

disposition, from the weakness of his situation, the commons believed that

he could now refuse them nothing. And they regarded the least moment of

relaxation in their invasion of royal authority as highly impolitic,

during the uninterrupted torrent of their successes. The very moment they

were informed of these last acquisitions, they affronted the queen by

opening some intercepted letters written to her by Lord Digby: they

carried up an impeachment against Herbert, attorney-general, for obeying

his master’s commands in accusing their members.[***] And they prosecuted

with fresh vigor their plan of the militia, on which they rested all

future hopes of an uncontrolled authority.

 

The commons were sensible that monarchical government, which during so

many ages had been established in England, would soon regain some degree

of its former dignity, after the present tempest was overblown; nor would

all their new invented limitations be able totally to suppress an

authority to which the nation had ever been accustomed. The sword alone,

to which all human ordinances must submit, could guard their acquired

power, and fully insure to them personal safety against the rising

indignation of their sovereign. This point, therefore, became the chief

object of their aims. A large magazine of arms being placed in the town of

Hull, they despatched thither Sir John Hotham, a gentleman of considerable

fortune in the neighborhood, and of an ancient family, and they gave him

the authority of governor. They sent orders to Goring, governor of

Portsmouth, to obey no commands but such as he should receive from the

parliament. Not content with having obliged the king to displace Lunsford,

whom he had appointed governor of the Tower,[*] they never ceased

soliciting him till he had also displaced Sir John Biron, a man of

unexceptionable character, and had bestowed that command on Sir John

Conyers, in whom alone, they said, they could repose confidence. After

making a fruitless attempt, in which the peers refused their concurrence,

to give public warning, that the people should put themselves in a posture

of defence against the enterprises of “Papists and other ill-affected

persons,”[**] they now resolved, by a bold and decisive stroke, to seize

at once the whole power of the sword, and to confer it entirely on their

own creatures and adherents.

 

The severe votes passed in the beginning of this parliament against

lieutenants and their deputies, for exercising powers assumed by all their

predecessors, had totally disarmed the crown, and had not left in any

magistrate military authority sufficient for the defence and security of

the nation. To remedy this inconvenience now appeared necessary. A bill

was introduced, and passed the two houses, which restored to lieutenants

and deputies the same powers of which the votes of the commons had

bereaved them; but at the same time the names of all the lieutenants were

inserted in the bill; and these consisted entirely of men in whom the

parliament could confide. And for their conduct they were accountable, by

the express terms of the bill, not to the king, but to the parliament.

 

The policy pursued by the commons, and which had hitherto succeeded to

admiration, was, to astonish the king by the boldness of their

enterprises, to intermingle no sweetness with their severity, to employ

expressions no less violent than their pretensions, and to make him

sensible in what little estimation they held both his person and his

dignity. To a bill so destructive of royal authority, they prefixed, with

an insolence seemingly wanton, a preamble equally dishonorable to the

personal character of the king. These are the words: “Whereas there has

been of late a most dangerous and desperate design upon the house of

commons, which we have just cause to believe an effect of the bloody

counsels of Papists and other ill-affected persons who have already raised

a rebellion in the kingdom of Ireland. And whereas, by reason of many

discoveries, we cannot but fear they will proceed, not only to stir up the

like rebellions and insurrections in this kingdom of England, but also to

back them with forces from abroad,” etc.[*]

 

Here Charles first ventured to put a stop to his concessions, and that not

by a refusal, but a delay. When this demand was made,—a demand,

which, if granted, the commons justly regarded as the last they should

ever have occasion to make,—he was at Dover, attending the queen and

the princess of Orange in their embarkation. He replied, that he had not

now leisure to consider a matter of so great importance, and must

therefore respite his answer till his return.[**] The parliament instantly

despatched another message to him, with solicitations still more

importunate. They expressed their great grief on account of his majesty’s

answer to their just and necessary petition. They represented, that any

delay during dangers and distractions so great and pressing, was not less

unsatisfactory and destructive than an absolute denial. They insisted,

that it was their duty to see put in execution a measure so necessary for

public safety. And they affirmed, that the people in many counties had

applied to them for that purpose, and in some places were, of themselves

and by their own authority, providing against those urgent dangers with

which they were threatened.[***]

 

Even after this insolence, the king durst not venture upon a flat denial.

Besides excepting to the preamble, which such dishonor upon him, and

protesting the innocence of his intentions when he entered the house of

commons, he only desired that the military authority, if it were

defective, should first be conferred upon the crown; and he promised to

bestow commissions, but such as should be revocable at pleasure, on the

same persons whom the parliament had named in the bill.[*] By a former

message, he had expressed his wishes that they would lay before him, in

one view, all the concessions which they deemed requisite for the

settlement of the nation. They pretended, that they were exposed to perils

so dreadful and imminent, that they had not leisure for such a work.[**]

The expedient proposed by the king seemed a sufficient remedy during this

emergence, and yet maintained the prerogatives of the crown entire and

unbroken.

 

But the intentions of the commons were wide of this purpose, and their

panics could be cured by one remedy alone. They instantly replied, that

the dangers and distempers of the nation were such as could endure no

longer delay; and unless the king speedily complied with their demands,

they should be constrained, for the safety of prince and people, to

dispose of the militia by the authority of both houses, and were resolved

to do it accordingly. They asserted, that those parts of the kingdom which

had, from their own authority, put themselves in a posture of defence

during these prevailing fears and jealousies, had acted suitably to the

declarations and directions of both houses, and conformably to the laws of

the kingdom. And while they thus menaced the king with their power they

invited him to fix his residence at London, where they knew he would be

entirely at mercy.[***]

 

“I am so much amazed at this message,” said the king in his prompt reply,

“that I know not what to answer. You speak of jealousies and fears. Lay

your hands on your hearts, and ask yourselves whether I may not likewise

be disturbed with fears and jealousies, and if so, I assure you that this

message has nothing lessened them.

 

“As to the militia, I thought so much of it before I gave that answer, and

am so much assured that the answer is agreeable to what in justice or

reason you can ask, or I in honor grant, that I shall not alter it in any

point.

 

“For my residence near you, I wish it might be safe and honorable, and

that I had no cause to absent myself from Whitehall: ask yourselves

whether I have not.[*]

 

“What would you have? Have I violated your laws? Have I denied to pass any

bill for the ease and security of my subjects? I do not ask what you have

done for me.

 

“Have any of my people been transported with fears and apprehensions? I

offer as free and general a pardon as yourselves can devise. All this

considered, there is a judgment of Heaven upon this nation if these

distractions continue.

 

“God so deal with me and mine as all my thoughts and intentions are

upright for the maintenance of the true Protestant profession, and for the

observance and preservation of the laws; and I hope God will bless and

assist those laws for my preservation.”[**]

 

No sooner did the commons despair of obtaining the king’s consent to their

bill, than they instantly voted, that those who advised his majesty’s

answer were enemies to the state, and mischievous projectors against the

safety of the nation; that this denial is of such dangerous consequence,

that, if his majesty persist in it, it will hazard the peace and

tranquillity of all his kingdoms, unless some speedy remedy be applied by

the wisdom and authority of both houses; and that such of the subjects as

have put themselves in a posture of defence against the common danger,

have done nothing but what is justifiable, and approved by the house.[***]

 

Lest the people might be averse to the seconding of all these usurpations,

they were plied anew with rumors of danger, with the terrors of invasion,

with the dread of English and Irish Papists; and the most unaccountable

panics were spread throughout the nation. Lord Digby having entered

Kingston in a coach and six, attended by a few livery servants, the

intelligence was conveyed to London; and it was immediately voted, that he

had appeared in a hostile manner, to the terror and affright of his

majesty’s subjects, and had levied war against the king and kingdom.[****]

Petitions from all quarters loudly demanded of the parliament to put the

nation in a posture of defence; and the county of Stafford in particular

expressed such dread of an insurrection among the Papists, that every man,

they said, was constrained to stand upon his guard, not even daring to go

to church unarmed.[v]

 

That the same violence by which he had so long been oppressed might not

still reach him, and extort his consent to the militia bill, Charles had

resolved to remove farther from London; and accordingly, taking the prince

of Wales and the duke of York along with him, he arrived by slow journeys

at York, which he determined for some time to make the place of his

residence. The distant parts of the kingdom, being removed from that

furious vortex of new principles and opinions which had transported the

capital, still retained a sincere regard for the church and monarchy; and

the king here found marks of attachment beyond what he had before

expected.[*]

 

From all quarters of England, the prime nobility and gentry, either

personally or by messages and letters, expressed their duty towards him;

and exhorted him to save himself and them from that ignominious slavery

with which they were threatened. The small interval of time which had

passed since the fatal accusation of the members, had been sufficient to

open the eyes of many, and to recover them from the astonishment with

which at first they had been seized. One rash and passionate attempt of

the king’s seemed but a small counterbalance to so many acts of deliberate

violence which had been offered to him and every branch of the

legislature; and, however sweet the sound of liberty, many resolved to

adhere to that moderate freedom transmitted them from their ancestors, and

now better secured by such important concessions, rather than, by engaging

in a giddy search after more independence, run a manifest risk either of

incurring a cruel subjection, or abandoning all law and order.

 

Charles, finding himself supported by a considerable party in the kingdom,

began to speak in a firmer tone, and to retort the accusations of the

commons with a vigor which he had not before exerted. Notwithstanding

their remonstrances, and menaces, and insults, he still persisted in

refusing their bill; and they proceeded to frame an ordinance, in which,

by the authority of the two houses, without the king’s consent, they named

lieutenants for all the counties, and conferred on them the command of the

whole military force, of all the guards, garrisons, and forts of the

kingdom. He issued proclamations against this manifest usurpation; and, as

he professed a resolution strictly to observe the law himself, so was he

determined, he said, to oblige every other person to pay it a like

obedience The name of the king was so essential to all laws, and so

familiar in all acts of executive authority, that the parliament was

afraid, had they totally omitted it, that the innovation would be too

sensible to the people. In all commands, therefore, which they conferred,

they bound the persons to obey the orders of his majesty signified by both

houses of parliament. And inventing a distinction, hitherto unheard of,

between the office and the person of the king, those very forces which

they employed against him they levied in his name and by his authority.[*]

 

It is remarkable how much the topics of argument were now reversed between

the parties. The king, while he acknowledged his former error, of

employing a plea of necessity in order to infringe the laws and

constitution, warned the parliament not to imitate an example on which

they threw such violent blame; and the parliament, while they clothed

their personal fears or ambition under the appearance of national and

imminent danger, made unknowingly an apology for the most exceptionable

part of the king’s conduct. That the liberties of the people were no

longer exposed to any peril from royal authority, so narrowly

circumscribed, so exactly defined, so much unsupported by revenue and by

military power, might be maintained upon very plausible topics: but that

the danger, allowing it to have any existence, was not of that kind,

great, urgent, inevitable, which dissolves all law and levels all

limitations, seems apparent from the simplest view of these transactions.

So obvious indeed was the king’s present inability to invade the

constitution, that the fears and jealousies which operated on the people,

and pushed them so furiously to arms, were undoubtedly not of a civil, but

of a religious nature. The distempered imaginations of men were agitated

with a continual dread of Popery, with a horror against prelacy, with an

antipathy to ceremonies and the liturgy, and with a violent affection for

whatever was most opposite to these objects of aversion. The fanatical

spirit, let loose, confounded all regard to ease, safety, interest; and

dissolved every moral and civil obligation.[**] 9
 

Each party was now willing to throw on its antagonist the odium of

commencing a civil war; but both of them prepared for an event which they

deemed inevitable. To gain the people’s favor and good opinion was the

chief point on both sides. Never was there a people less corrupted by

vice, and more actuated by principle, than the English during that period:

never were there individuals who possessed more capacity, more courage,

more public spirit, more disinterested zeal. The infusion of one

ingredient in too large a proportion had corrupted all these noble

principles, and converted them into the most virulent poison. To determine

his choice in the approaching contests, every man hearkened with avidity

to the reasons proposed on both sides. The war of the pen preceded that of

the sword, and daily sharpened the humors of the opposite parties. Besides

private adventurers without number, the king and parliament themselves

carried on the controversy by messages, remonstrances, and declarations;

where the nation was really the party to whom all arguments were

addressed. Charles had here a double advantage. Not only his cause was

more favorable, as supporting the ancient government in church and state

against the most illegal pretensions; it was also defended with more art

and eloquence. Lord Falkland had accepted the office of secretary; a man

who adorned the purest virtue, with the richest gifts of nature, and the

most valuable acquisitions of learning. By him, assisted by the king

himself, were the memorials of the royal party chiefly composed. So

sensible was Charles of his superiority in this particular, that he took

care to disperse every where the papers of the parliament together with

his own, that the people might be the more enabled, by comparison, to form

a judgment between them: the parliament, while they distributed copies of

their own, were anxious to suppress all the king’s compositions.[*]

 

To clear up the principles of the constitution, to mark the boundaries of

the powers intrusted by law to the several members, to show what great

improvements the whole political system had received from the king’s late

concessions, to demonstrate his entire confidence in his people, and his

reliance on their affections, to point out the ungrateful returns which

had been made him, and the enormous encroachments, insults, and

indignities to which he had been exposed; these were the topics which,

with so much justness of reasoning and propriety of expression, were

insisted on in the king’s declarations and remonstrances.[**] 11
 

Though these writings were of consequence, and tended much to reconcile

the nation to Charles, it was evident that they would not be decisive, and

that keener weapons must determine the controversy. To the ordinance of

the parliament concerning the militia, the king opposed his commissions of

array. The counties obeyed the one or the other, according as they stood

affected. And in many counties, where the people were divided, mobbish

combats and skirmishes ensued.[*] The parliament on this occasion went so

far as to vote, “That when the lords and commons in parliament, which is

the supreme court of judicature, shall declare what the law of the land

is, to have this not only questioned, but contradicted, is a high breach

of their privileges.”[**] This was a plain assuming of the whole

legislative authority, and exerting it in the most material article, the

government of the militia. Upon the same principles they pretended, by a

verbal criticism on the tense of a Latin verb, to ravish from the king his

negative voice in the legislature.[***]

 

The magazine of Hull contained the arms of all the forces levied against

the Scots; and Sir John Hotham, the governor, though he had accepted of a

commission from the parliament, was not thought to be much disaffected to

the church and monarchy. Charles therefore entertained hopes that if he

presented himself at Hull before the commencement of hostilities, Hotham,

overawed by his presence, would admit him with his retinue; after which he

might easily render himself master of the place. But the governor was on

his guard. He shut the gates, and refused to receive the king, who desired

leave to enter with twenty persons only. Charles immediately proclaimed

him traitor, and complained to the parliament of his disobedience. The

parliament avowed and justified the action.[****]

 

The county of York levied a guard for the king of six hundred men; for the

kings of England had hitherto lived among their subjects like fathers

among their children, and had derived all their security from the dignity

of their character, and from the protection of the laws. The two houses,

though they had already levied a guard for themselves, had attempted to

seize all the military power, all the navy, and all the forts of the

kingdom, and had openly employed their authority in every kind of warlike

preparations, yet immediately voted, “That the king, seduced by wicked

counsel, intended to make war against his parliament, who, in all their

consultations and actions, had proposed no other end but the care of his

kingdoms, and the performance of all duty and loyalty to his person; that

this attempt was a breach of the trust reposed in him by his people,

contrary to his oath, and tending to a dissolution of the government; and

that whoever should assist him in such a war, were traitors to the

fundamental laws of the kingdom.”[*]

 

The armies which had been everywhere raised on pretence of the service in

Ireland, were henceforth more openly enlisted by the parliament for their

own purposes, and the command of them was given to the earl of Essex. In

London, no less than four thousand men enlisted in one day.[**] And the

parliament voted a declaration, which they required every member to

subscribe, that they would live and die with their general.

 

They issued orders for bringing in loans of money and plate, in order to

maintain forces which should defend the king and both houses of

parliament; for this style they still preserved. Within ten days, vast

quantities of plate were brought to their treasurers. Hardly were there

men enough to receive it, or room sufficient to stow it; and many with

regret were obliged to carry back their offerings, and wait till the

treasurers could find leisure to receive them; such zeal animated the

pious partisans of the parliament, especially in the city. The women gave

up all the plate and ornaments of their houses, and even their silver

thimbles and bodkins, “in order to support the good cause against the

malignants.”[***]

 

Meanwhile the splendor of the nobility with which the king was environed

much eclipsed the appearance at Westminster. Lord Keeper Littleton, after

sending the great seal before him, had fled to York. Above forty peers of

the first rank attended the king,[*] whilst the house of lords seldom

consisted of more than sixteen members. Near the moiety, too, of the lower

house absented themselves from counsels which they deemed so full of

danger. The commons sent up an impeachment against nine peers, for

deserting their duty in parliament. Their own members, also, who should

return to them, they voted not to admit till satisfied concerning the

reason of their absence.

 

Charles made a declaration to the peers who attended him, that he expected

from them no obedience to any commands which were not warranted by the

laws of the land. The peers answered this declaration by a protest, in

which they declared their resolution to obey no commands but such as were

warranted by that authority.[**] By these deliberate engagements, so

worthy of an English prince and English nobility, they meant to confound

the furious and tumultuary resolutions taken by the parliament.

 

The queen, disposing of the crown jewels in Holland, had been enabled to

purchase a cargo of arms and ammunition. Part of these, after escaping

many perils, arrived safely to the king. His preparations were not near so

forward as those of the parliament. In order to remove all jealousy, he

had resolved that their usurpations and illegal pretensions should be

apparent to the whole world; and thought that to recover the confidence of

the people was a point much more material to his interest, than the

collecting of any magazines, stores, or armies which might breed

apprehensions of violent or illegal counsels. But the urgent necessity of

his situation no longer admitted of delay. He now prepared himself for

defence. With a spirit, activity, and address, which neither the one party

apprehended nor the other expected, he employed all the advantages which

remained to him, and roused up his adherents to arms. The resources of

this prince’s genius increased in proportion to his difficulties, and he

never appeared greater than when plunged into the deepest perils and

distresses. From the mixed character, indeed, of Charles, arose in part

the misfortunes in which England was at this time involved. His political

errors, or rather weaknesses, had raised him inveterate enemies: his

eminent moral virtues had procured him zealous partisans; and between the

hatred of the one, and the affections of the other, was the nation

agitated with the most violent convulsions.

 

That the king might despair of all composition, the parliament sent him

the conditions on which they were willing to some to an agreement. Their

demands, contained in nineteen propositions, amounted to a total abolition

of monarchical authority. They required that no man should remain in the

council who was not agreeable to parliament; that no deed of the king’s

should have validity unless it passed the council, and was attested under

their hand; that all the officers of state and principal judges should be

chosen with consent of parliament, and enjoy their offices for life; that

none of the royal family should marry without consent of parliament or

council; that the laws should be executed against Catholics; that the

votes of Popish lords should be excluded; that the reformation of the

liturgy and church government should, have place according to advice of

parliament; that the ordinance with regard to the militia be submitted to;

that the justice of parliament pass upon all delinquents; that a general

pardon be granted, with such exceptions as should be advised by parliament

that the forts and castles be disposed of by consent of parliament; and

that no peer be made but with consent of both houses.[*]

 

“Should I grant these demands,” said the king in reply, “I may be waited

on bareheaded; I may have my hand kissed; the title of majesty may be

continued to me; and ‘the king’s authority, signified by both houses,’ may

still be the style of your commands; I may have swords and maces carried

before me, and please myself with the sight of a crown and sceptre,

(though even these twigs would not long flourish when the stock upon which

they grew was dead;) but as to true and real power, I should remain but

the outside, but the picture, but the sign of a king.”[**] War on any

terms was esteemed, by the king and all the counsellors, preferable to so

ignominious a peace. Charles accordingly resolved to support his authority

by arms. “His towns,” he said, “were taken from him, his ships, his arms,

his money; but there still remained to him a good cause, and the hearts of

his loyal subjects, which, with God’s blessing, he doubted not would

recover all the rest.” Collecting, therefore, some forces, he advanced

southwards; and at Nottingham he erected his royal standard, the open

signal of discord and civil war throughout the kingdom.
