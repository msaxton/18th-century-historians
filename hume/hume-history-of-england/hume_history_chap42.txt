The dangers which arose from the character, principles, and pretensions of

the queen of Scots, had very early engaged Elizabeth to consult, in her

treatment of that unfortunate princess, the dictates of jealousy and

politics, rather than of friendship or generosity: resentment of this

usage had pushed Mary into enterprises which had nearly threatened the

repose and authority of Elizabeth: the rigor and restraint thence

redoubled upon the captive queen,[*] still impelled her to attempt greater

extremities; and while her impatience of confinement, her revenge,[**] 20 and

her high spirit concurred with religious zeal, and the suggestions of

desperate bigots, she was at last engaged in designs which afforded her

enemies, who watched the opportunity, a pretence or reason for effecting

her final ruin.

 

The English seminary at Rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch

of rage and animosity against the queen. The recent persecutions from

which they had escaped; the new rigors which they knew awaited them in the

course of their missions; the liberty which for the present they enjoyed

of declaiming against that princess; and the contagion of that religious

fury which every where surrounded them in France; all these causes had

obliterated with them every maxim of common sense, and every principle of

morals or humanity. Intoxicated with admiration of the divine power and

infallibility of the pope, they revered his bull by which he

excommunicated and deposed the queen; and some of them had gone to that

height of extravagance as to assert, that that performance had been

immediately dictated by the Holy Ghost. The assassination of heretical

sovereigns, and of that princess in particular, was represented as the

most meritorious of all enterprises; and they taught, that whoever

perished in such pious attempts, enjoyed, without dispute, the glorious

and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By such doctrines, they instigated

John Savage, a man of desperate courage, who had served some years in the

Low Countries under the prince of Parma, to attempt the life of Elizabeth;

and this assassin, having made a vow to persevere in his design, was sent

over to England, and recommended to the confidence of the more zealous

Catholics.

 

About the same time, John Ballard, a priest of that seminary, had returned

to Paris from his mission in England and Scotland; and as he had observed

a spirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent among the Catholic

devotees in these countries, he had founded on that disposition the

project of dethroning Elizabeth, and of restoring by force of arms the

exercise of the ancient religion.[*] The situation of affairs abroad

seemed favorable to this enterprise; the pope, the Spaniard, the duke of

Guise, concurring in interests, had formed a resolution to make some

attempt against England: and Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador at Paris,

strongly encouraged Ballard to hope for succors from these princes.

Charles Paget alone, a zealous Catholic and a devoted partisan of the

queen of Scots, being well acquainted with the prudence, vigor, and

general popularity of Elizabeth, always maintained that, so long as that

princess was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any success from an

enterprise upon England. Ballard, persuaded of this truth, saw more

clearly the necessity of executing the design formed at Rheims; he came

over to England in the disguise of a soldier, and assumed the name of

Captain Fortescue; and he bent his endeavors to effect at once the project

of an assassination, an insurrection, and an invasion.[**]

 

The first person to whom he addressed himself was Anthony Babington, of

Dethic, in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good family,

possessed a plentiful fortune, had discovered an excellent capacity, and

was accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station. Being

zealously devoted to the Catholic communion, he had secretly made a

journey to Paris some time before, and had fallen into intimacy with

Thomas Morgan, a bigoted fugitive from England, and with the bishop of

Glasgow, Mary’s ambassador at the court of France. By continually

extolling the amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that

princess, they impelled the sanguine and unguarded mind of young Babington

to make some attempt for her service; and they employed every principle of

ambition, gallantry, and religious zeal, to give him a contempt of those

dangers which attended any enterprise against the vigilant government of

Elizabeth. Finding him well disposed for their purpose, they sent him back

to England, and secretly, unknown to himself, recommended him to the queen

of Scots, as a person worth engaging in her service. She wrote him a

letter, full of friendship and confidence; and Babington, ardent in his

temper and zealous in his principles, thought that these advances now

bound him in honor to devote himself entirely to the service of that

unfortunate princess. During some time, he had found means of conveying to

her all her foreign correspondence; but after she was put under the

custody of Sir Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement,

he experienced so much difficulty and danger in rendering her this

service, that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature.

 

When Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found his zeal

suspended, not extinguished: his former ardor revived on the mention of

any enterprise which seemed to promise success in the cause of Mary and of

the Catholic religion. He had entertained sentiments conformable to those

of Paget, and represented the folly of all attempts which, during the

lifetime of Elizabeth, could be formed against the established religion

and government of England. Ballard, encouraged by this hint, proceeded to

discover to him the design undertaken by Savage;[*] and was well pleased

to observe that, instead of being shocked with the project, Babington only

thought it not secure enough, when intrusted to one single hand, and

proposed to join five others with Savage in this desperate enterprise.

 

In prosecution of these views, Babington employed himself in increasing

the number of his associates; and he secretly drew into the conspiracy

many Catholic gentlemen, discontented with the present government.

Barnwell, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of

Lancashire, and Abington, whose father had been cofferer to the household

readily undertook the assassination of the queen. Charles Tilney, the heir

of an ancient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the design was

proposed to them, expressed some scruples, which were removed by the

arguments of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refused, during some

time, to share the glory of the enterprise with any others;[*] he

challenged the whole to himself; and it was with some difficulty he was

induced to depart from this preposterous ambition.

 

The deliverance of the queen of Scots, at the very same instant when

Elizabeth should be assassinated, was requisite for effecting the purpose

of the conspirators; and Babington undertook, with a party of a hundred

horse, to attack her guards while she should be taking the air on

horseback. In this enterprise, he engaged Edward Windsor, brother to the

lord of that name, Thomas Salisbury, Robert Gage, John Travers, John

Jones, and Henry Donne; most of them men of family and interest. The

conspirators much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of note whom

they might place at the head of the enterprise; but they trusted that the

great events, of the queen’s death and Mary’s deliverance, would rouse all

the zealous Catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking advantage

of the general confusion, would easily fix the queen of Scots on the

throne, and reestablish the ancient religion.

 

These desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth’s

council, particularly of Walsingham, secretary of state. That artful

minister had engaged Maud, a Catholic priest, whom he retained in pay, to

attend Ballard in his journey to France, and had thereby got a hint of the

designs entertained by the fugitives. Polly, another of his spies, had

found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in England; and,

though not entirely trusted, had obtained some insight into their

dangerous secrets. But the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known,

till Gifford, a seminary priest, came over and made a tender of his

services to Walsingham. By his means, the discovery became of the utmost

importance, and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of those zealous

partisans of that princess.

 

Babington and his associates, having laid such a plan as, they thought,

promised infallible success, were impatient to communicate the design to

the queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation and concurrence. For

this service they employed Gifford, who immediately applied to Walsingham,

that the interest of that minister might forward his secret correspondence

with Mary. Walsingham proposed the matter to Paulet, and desired him to

connive at Gifford’s corrupting one of his servants; but Paulet, averse to

the introducing of such a pernicious precedent into his family, desired

that they would rather think of some other expedient. Gifford found a

brewer, who supplied the family with ale; and bribed him to convey letters

to the captive queen. The letters, by Paulet’s connivance, were thrust

through a chink in the wall; and answers were returned by the same

conveyance.

 

Ballard and Babington were at first diffident of Gifford’s fidelity; and

to make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up like

letters; but finding by the answers that these had been faithfully

delivered, they laid aside all further scruple, and conveyed by his hands

the most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy. Babington

informed Mary of the design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an

insurrection at home, the scheme for her deliverance, and the conspiracy

for assassinating the usurper, by six noble gentlemen, as he termed them,

all of them his private friends; who, from the zeal which they bore to the

Catholic cause and her majesty’s service, would undertake the “tragical

execution.” Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design; that the

gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it should ever be in her

power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary

circumstance, before any attempts were made, either for her own

deliverance or an insurrection.[*]

 

These letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the archbishop of

Glasgow, and Sir Francis Inglefield, were carried by Gifford to Secretary

Walsingham; were deciphered by the art of Philips, his clerk; and copies

taken of them. Walsingham employed another artifice, in order to obtain

full insight into the plot: he subjoined to a letter of Mary’s a

postscript in the same cipher; in which he made her desire Babington to

inform her of the names of the conspirators. The indiscretion of Babington

furnished Walsingham with still another means of detection, as well as of

defence. That gentlemen had caused a picture to be drawn, where he himself

was represented standing amidst the six assassins; and a motto was

subjoined, expressing that their common perils were the band of their

confederacy. A copy of this picture was brought to Elizabeth, that she

might know the assassins, and guard herself against their approach to her

person.

 

Meanwhile Babington, anxious to insure and hasten the foreign succors,

resolved to despatch Ballard into France; and he procured for him, under a

feigned name, a license to travel. In order to remove from himself all

suspicion, he applied to Walsingharn, pretended great zeal for the queen’s

service, offered to go abroad, and professed his intentions of employing

the confidence which he had gained among the Catholics, to the detection

and disappointment of their conspiracies. Walsingham commended his loyal

purposes; and promising his own counsel and assistance in the execution of

them, still fed him with hopes, and maintained a close correspondence with

him. A warrant, meanwhile, was issued for seizing Ballard; and this

incident, joined to the consciousness of guilt, begat in all the

conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern. Some advised that they should

immediately make their escape; others proposed that Savage and Charnoc

should without delay execute their purpose against Elizabeth; and

Babington, in prosecution of this scheme, furnished Savage with money,

that he might buy good clothes, and thereby have more easy access to the

queen’s person. Next day, they began to apprehend that they had taken the

alarm too hastily; and Babington, having renewed his correspondence with

Walsingham, was persuaded by that subtle minister, that the seizure of

Ballard had proceeded entirely from the usual diligence of informers in

the detection of popish and seminary priests. He even consented to take

lodgings secretly in Walsingham’s house, that they might have more

frequent conferences together before his intended departure for France;

but observing that he was watched and guarded, he made his escape, and

gave the alarm to the other conspirators. They all took to flight, covered

themselves with several disguises, and lay concealed in woods or barns;

but were soon discovered and thrown into prison. In their examinations

they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full

confession of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and executed, of whom

seven, acknowledged the crime on their trial; the rest were convicted by

evidence.

 

The lesser conspirators being despatched, measures were taken for the

trial and conviction of the queen of Scots; on whose account, and with

whose concurrence, these attempts had been made against the life of the

queen, and the tranquillity of the kingdom. Some of Elizabeth’s

counsellors were averse to this procedure, and thought that the close

confinement of a woman who was become very sickly, and who would probably

put a speedy period to their anxiety by her natural death, might give

sufficient security to the government without attempting a measure of

which there scarcely remains any example in history. Leicester advised

that Mary should be secretly despatched by poison; and he sent a divine to

convince Walsingham of the lawfulness of that action: but Walsingham

declared his abhorrence of it; and still insisted, in conjunction with the

majority of the counsellors, for the open trial of the queen of Scots. The

situation of England, and of the English ministers, had, indeed, been

hitherto not a little dangerous. No successor of the crown was declared;

but the heir of blood, to whom the people in general were likely to

adhere, was, by education, an enemy to the national religion; was, from

multiplied provocations, an enemy to the ministers and principal nobility;

and their personal safety, as well as the safety of the public, seemed to

depend alone on the queen’s life, who was now somewhat advanced in years.

No wonder, therefore, that Elizabeth’s counsellors, knowing themselves to

be so obnoxious to the queen of Scots, endeavored to push every measure to

extremities against her; and were even more anxious than the queen

herself, to prevent her from ever mounting the throne of England.

 

Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington’s

conspiracy, every avenue to the queen of Scots had been so strictly

guarded, that she remained in utter ignorance of the matter; and it was a

great surprise to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth’s orders,

informed her, that all her accomplices were discovered and arrested. He

chose the time for giving her this intelligence when she was mounted on

horseback to go a hunting; and she was not permitted to return to her

former place of abode, but war conducted from one gentleman’s house to

another, till she was lodged in Fotheringay Castle, in the County of

Northampton, which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial

and sufferings. Her two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot,

were immediately arrested: all her papers were seized, and sent up to the

council: above sixty different keys to ciphers were discovered: there were

also found many letters from persons beyond sea, and several too from

English noblemen containing expressions of respect and attachment. The

queen took no notice of this latter discovery; but the persons themselves,

knowing their correspondence to be detected, though that they had no other

means of making atonement for their imprudence, than by declaring

themselves thenceforth the most inveterate enemies of the queen of

Scots.[*]

 

It was resolved to try Mary, not by the common statute of treasons, but by

the act which had passed the former year with a view to this very event;

and the queen, in terms of that act, appointed a commission, consisting of

forty noblemen and privy counsellors, and empowered them to examine and

pass sentence on Mary, whom she denominated the late queen of Scots, and

heir to James V. of Scotland. The commissioners came to Fotheringay

Castle, and sent to her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward

Barker, who delivered her a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the

commission, and of the approaching trial. Mary received the intelligence

without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that it seemed strange

to her, that the queen should command her, as a subject, to submit to a

trial and examination before subjects; that she was an absolute,

independent princess, and would yield to nothing which might derogate

either from her royal majesty, from the state of sovereign princes, or

from the dignity and rank of her son: that, however oppressed by

misfortunes, she was not yet so much broken in spirit as her enemies

flattered themselves; nor would she, on any account, be accessary to her

own degradation and dishonor: that she was ignorant of the laws and

statutes of England; was utterly destitute of counsel; and could not

conceive who were entitled to be called her peers, or could legally sit as

judges on her trial: that though she had lived in England for many years,

she had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the

laws, she could not, merely by her involuntary residence in the country,

be supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction: that,

notwithstanding the superiority of her rank, she was willing to give an

account of her conduct before an English parliament; but could not view

these commissioners in any other light than as men appointed to justify,

by some color of legal proceeding, her condemnation and execution: and

that she warned them to look to their conscience and their character in

trying an innocent person; and to reflect, that these transactions would

somewhere be subject to revisal, and that the theatre of the whole world

was much wider than the kingdom of England.

 

In return, the commissioners sent a new deputation, informing her, that

her plea, either from her royal dignity or from her imprisonment, could

not be admitted; and that they were empowered to proceed to her trial,

even though she should refuse to answer before them. Burleigh, the

treasurer, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much reasoning to make

her submit; but the person whose arguments had the chief influence, was

Sir Christopher Hatton, vice-chamberlain. His speech was to this purpose:

“You are accused, madam,” said he, “but not condemned, of having conspired

the destruction of our lady and queen anointed. You say you are a queen;

but, in such a crime as this, and such a situation as yours, the royal

dignity itself, neither by the civil or canon law, nor by the law of

nature or of nations, is exempt from judgment. If you be innocent, you

wrong your reputation in avoiding a trial. We have been present at your

protestations of innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwise, and is

heartily sorry for the appearances which lie against you. To examine,

therefore, your cause, she has appointed commissioners; honorable persons,

prudent and upright men, who are ready to hear you with equity, and even

with favor, and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations

which have been thrown upon you. Believe me, madam, the queen herself will

rejoice, who affirmed to me, at my departure, that nothing which ever

befell her had given her so much uneasiness, as that you should be

suspected of a concurrence in these criminal enterprises. Laying aside,

therefore, the fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity, which

can now avail you nothing, trust to the better defence of your innocence,

make it appear in open trial, and leave not upon your memory that stain of

infamy which must attend your obstinate silence on this occasion.” [*]

 

By this artful speech, Mary was persuaded to answer before the court; and

thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and prevented

those difficulties which the commissioners must have fallen into, had she

persevered in maintaining so specious a plea as that of her sovereign and

independent character. Her conduct in this particular must be regarded as

the more imprudent; because formerly, when Elizabeth’s commissioners

pretended not to exercise any jurisdiction over her, and only entered into

her cause by her own consent and approbation, she declined justifying

herself, when her honor, which ought to have been dearer to her than life,

seemed absolutely to require it.

 

On her first appearance before the commissioners, Mary, either sensible of

her imprudence, or still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a

trial, renewed her protestation against the authority of her judges: the

chancellor answered her, by pleading the supreme authority of the English

laws over every one who resided in England; and the commissioners

accommodated matters, by ordering both her protestation and his answer to

be recorded.

 

The lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the queen of

Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that she had allowed Cardinal

Allen and others to treat her as queen of England; and that she had kept a

correspondence with Lord Paget and Charles Paget, in view of engaging the

Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary seemed not anxious to clear herself

from either of these imputations. She only said that she could not hinder

others from using what style they pleased in writing to her; and that she

might lawfully try every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.

 

An intercepted letter of hers to Mendoza was next produced; in which she

promised to transfer to Philip her right to the kingdom of England, if her

son should refuse to be converted to the Catholic faith; an event, she

there said, of which there was no expectation while he remained in the

hands of his Scottish subjects.[*]

 

Even this part of the charge she took no pains to deny, or rather she

seemed to acknowledge it. She said that she had no kingdoms to dispose of;

yet was it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own, and

she was not accountable to any for her actions. She added, that she had

formerly rejected that proposal from Spain; but now, since all her hopes

in England were gone, she was fully determined not to refuse foreign

assistance. There was also produced evidence to prove, that Allen and

Parsons were at that very time negotiating, by her orders, at Rome, the

conditions of transferring her English crown to the king of Spain, and of

disinheriting her heretical son.[*] 21
 

It is remarkable, that Mary’s prejudices against her son were at this time

carried so far, that she had even entered into a conspiracy against him,

had appointed Lord Claud Hamilton regent of Scotland, and had instigated

her adherents to seize James’s person, and deliver him into the hands of

the pope, or the king of Spain; whence he was never to be delivered, but

on condition of his becoming Catholic.[**] 24
 

The only part of the charge which Mary positively denied, was her

concurrence in the design of assassinating Elizabeth. This article,

indeed, was the most heavy, and the only one that could fully justify the

queen in proceeding to extremities against her. In order to prove the

accusation, there were produced the following evidence: copies taken in

Secretary Walsingham’s office of the intercepted letters between her and

Babington, in which her approbation of the murder was clearly expressed;

the evidence of her two secretaries, Nau and Curle, who had confessed,

without being put to any torture, both that she received these letters

from Babington, and that they had written the answers by her order; the

confession of Babington, that he had written the letters and received the

answers,[***] and the confession of Ballard and Savage, that Babington had

showed them these letters of Mary, written in the cipher which had been

settled between them.

 

It is evident, that this complication of evidence, though every

circumstance corroborates the general conclusion, resolves itself finally

into the testimony of the two secretaries, who alone were certainly

acquainted with their mistress’s concurrence in Babington’s conspiracy,

but who knew themselves exposed to all the rigors of imprisonment,

torture, and death, if they refused to give any evidence which might be

required of them. In the case of an ordinary criminal, this proof, with

all its disadvantages, would be esteemed legal, and even satisfactory, if

not opposed by some other circumstances which shake the credit of the

witnesses: but on the present trial, where the absolute power of the

prosecutor concurred with such important interests, and such a violent

inclination to have the princess condemned, the testimony of two

witnesses, even though men of character, ought to be supported by strong

probabilities, in order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice.

The proof against Mary, it must be confessed, is not destitute of this

advantage; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for

Babington’s receiving an answer written in her name, and in the cipher

concerted between them, without allowing that the matter had been

communicated to that princess. Such is the light in which this matter

appears, even after time has discovered every thing which could guide our

judgment with regard to it: no wonder, therefore, that the queen of Scots,

unassisted by counsel, and confounded by so extraordinary a trial, found

herself incapable of making a satisfactory defence before the

commissioners. Her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial: whatever

force may be in that denial was much weakened by her positively affirming,

that she never had had any correspondence of any kind with Babington; a

fact, however, of which there remains not the least question.[*] 25 She

asserted, that as Nau and Curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity

to her, their evidence against her ought not to be credited. She

confessed, however, that Nau had been in the service of her uncle, the

cardinal of Lorraine, and had been recommended to her by the king of

France, as a man in whom she might safely confide. She also acknowledged

Curle to be a very honest man, but simple and easily imposed on by Nau. If

these two men had received any letters, or had written any answers,

without her knowledge, the imputation, she said, could never lie on her.

And she was the more inclined, she added, to entertain this suspicion

against them, because Nau had, in other instances, been guilty of a like

temerity, and had ventured to transact business in her name, without

communicating the matter to her.[**] 26
 

The sole circumstance of her defence which to us may appear to have some

force, was her requiring that Nau and Cure should be confronted with her,

and her affirming that they never would to her face persist in their

evidence. But that demand, however equitable, was not then supported by

law in trials of high treason, and was often refused, even in other trials

where the crown was prosecutor. The clause contained in an act of the

thirteenth of the queen, was a novelty; that the species of treason there

enumerated must be proved by two witnesses, confronted with the criminal.

But Mary was not tried upon that act; and the ministers and crown lawyers

of this reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the

strict letter of the law, and the settled practice of the courts of

justice, required of them. Not to mention, that these secretaries were not

probably at Fotheringay Castle during the time of the trial, and could

not, upon Mary’s demand, be produced before the commissioners.[*]

 

There passed two incidents in this trial which may be worth observing. A

letter between Mary and Babington was read, in which mention was made of

the earl of Arundel and his brothers: on hearing their names, she broke

into a sigh. “Alas,” said she, “what has the noble house of the Howards

suffered for my sake!” She affirmed, with regard to the same letter, that

it was easy to forge the handwriting and cipher of another; she was afraid

that this was too familiar a practice with Walsingham, who, she also

heard, had frequently practised both against her life and her son’s.

Walsingham, who was one of the commissioners, rose up. He protested that,

in his private capacity, he had never acted any thing against the queen of

Scots: in his public capacity, he owned, that his concern for his

sovereign’s safety had made him very diligent in searching out, by every

expedient, all designs against her sacred person or her authority. For

attaining that end, he would not only make use of the assistance of

Ballard or any other conspirator; he would also reward them for betraying

their companions. But if he had tampered in any manner unbefitting his

character and office, why did none of the late criminals, either at their

trial or execution accuse him of such practices? Mary endeavored to pacify

him, by saying that she spoke from information; and she begged him to give

thenceforth no more credit to such as slandered her, than she should to

such as accused him. The great character, indeed, which Sir Francis

Walsingham bears for probity and honor, should remove from him all

suspicion of such base arts as forgery and subornation; arts which even

the most corrupt ministers, in the most corrupt times, would scruple to

employ.

 

Having finished the trial, the commissioners, adjourned from Fotheringay

Castle, and met in the star chamber at London, where, after taking the

oaths of Mary’s two secretaries, who voluntarily, without hope or reward,

vouched the authenticity of those letters before produced, they pronounced

sentence of death upon the queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their seals

and subscriptions. The same day, a declaration was published by the

commissioners and the judges “that the sentence did nowise derogate from

the title and honor of James, king of Scotland; but that he was in the

same place, degree, and right, as if the sentence had never been

pronounced.”[*]

 

The queen had now brought affairs with Mary to that situation which she

had long ardently desired; and had found a plausible reason for executing

vengeance on a competitor, whom, from the beginning of her reign, she had

ever equally dreaded and hated. But she was restrained from instantly

gratifying her resentment, by several important considerations. She

foresaw the invidious colors in which this example of uncommon

jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partisans of Mary, and

the reproach to which she herself might be exposed with all foreign

princes, perhaps with all posterity. The rights of hospitality, of

kindred, and of royal majesty, seemed in one signal instance to be all

violated; and this sacrifice of generosity to interest, of clemency to

revenge, might appear equally unbecoming a sovereign and a woman.

Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost

reluctance to proceed to the execution of the sentence; affected the most

tender sympathy with her prisoner; displayed all her scruples and

difficulties; rejected the solicitation of her courtiers and ministers;

and affirmed that, were she not moved by the deepest concern for her

people’s safety, she would not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the

injuries which she herself had received from the queen of Scots.

 

That the voice of her people might be more audibly heard in the demand of

justice upon Mary, she summoned a new parliament; and she knew, both from

the usual dispositions of that assembly, and from the influence of her

ministers over them, that she should not want the most earnest

solicitation to consent to that measure which was so agreeable to her

secret inclinations. She did not open this assembly in person, but

appointed for that purpose three commissioners, Bromley, the chancellor,

Burleigh, the treasurer, and the earl of Derby. The reason assigned for

this measure was, that the queen, foreseeing that the affair of the queen

of Scots would be canvassed in parliament, found her tenderness and

delicacy so much hurt by that melancholy incident, that she had not the

courage to be present while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her

eyes from what she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and

uneasiness. She was also willing, that, by this unusual precaution, the

people should see the danger to which her person was hourly exposed; and

should thence be more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal,

whose restless intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her

to the most imminent perils.[*]

 

The parliament answered the queen’s expectations: the sentence against

Mary was unanimously ratified by both houses, and an application was voted

to obtain Elizabeth’s consent to its publication and execution.[**] She

gave an answer ambiguous, embarrassed; full of real artifice, and seeming

irresolution. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life was

continually exposed; she declared her willingness to die, did she not

foresee the great calamities which would thence fall upon the nation; she

made professions of the greatest tenderness to her people; she displayed

the clemency of her temper, and expressed her violent reluctance to

execute the sentence against her unhappy kinswoman; she affirmed, that the

late law, by which that princess was tried, so far from being made to

insnare her, was only intended to give her warning beforehand, not to

engage in such attempts as might expose her to the penalties with which

she was thus openly menaced; and she begged them to think once again,

whether it were possible to find any expedient, besides the death of the

queen of Scots, for securing the public tranquility.[***]

 

The parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under

consideration; but could find no other possible expedient. They reiterated

their solicitations, and entreaties, and arguments: they even

remonstrated, that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her

subjects and children: and they affirmed, that it were injustice to deny

execution of the law to any individual; much more to the whole body of the

people, now unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her

parental care and tenderness. This second address set the pretended doubts

and scruples of Elizabeth anew in agitation; she complained of her now

unfortunate situation; expressed her uneasiness from their importunity;

renewed the professions of affection to her people; and dismissed the

committee of parliament in an uncertainty what, after all this

deliberation, might be her final resolution.[*] 27
 

But though the queen affected reluctance to execute the sentence against

Mary, she complied with the request of parliament in publishing it by

proclamation; and this act seemed to be attended with the unanimous and

hearty rejoicings of the people. Lord Buckhurst, and Beale, clerk of the

council, were sent to the queen of Scots, and notified to her the sentence

pronounced against her, its ratification by parliament, and the earnest

applications made for its execution by that assembly, who thought that

their religion could never, while she was alive, attain a full settlement

and security. Mary was nowise dismayed at this intelligence: on the

contrary, she joyfully laid hold of the last circumstance mentioned to

her; and insisted, that since her death was demanded by the Protestants

for the establishment of their faith, she was really a martyr to her

religion, and was entitled to all the merits attending that glorious

character. She added, that the English had often imbrued their hands in

the blood of their sovereigns: no wonder they exercised cruelty against

her, who derived her descent from these monarchs.[**] Paulet, her keeper,

received orders to take down her canopy, and to serve her no longer with

the respect due to sovereign princes. He told her, that she was now to be

considered as a dead person, and incapable of any dignity.[***] This harsh

treatment produced not in her any seeming emotion. She only replied, that

she received her royal character from the hands of the Almighty, and no

earthly power was ever able to bereave her of it.

 

The queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Elizabeth; full of dignity,

without departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity which

appeared suitable to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life. She

preferred no petition for averting the fatal sentence: on the contrary she

expressed her gratitude to Heaven for thus bringing to a speedy period her

sad and lamentable pilgrimage. She requested some favors of Elizabeth; and

entreated her that she might be beholden for them to her own goodness

alone, without making applications to those ministers who had discovered

such an extreme malignity against her person and her religion. She

desired, that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent

blood, her body, which it was determined should never enjoy rest while her

soul was united to it, might be consigned to her servants, and be conveyed

by them into France, there to repose in a Catholic land, with the sacred

relics of her mother. In Scotland, she said, the sepulchres of her

ancestors were violated, and the churches either demolished or profaned;

and in England, where she might be interred among the ancient kings, her

own and Elizabeth’s progenitors, she could entertain no hopes of being

accompanied to the grave with those rites and ceremonies which her

religion required. She requested, that no one might have the power of

inflicting a private death upon her, without Elizabeth’s knowledge; but

that her execution should be public, and attended by her ancient servants,

who might bear testimony of her perseverance in the faith, and of her

submission to the will of Heaven. She begged that these servants might

afterwards be allowed to depart whithersoever they pleased, and might

enjoy those legacies which she should bequeath them. And she conjured her

to grant these favors by their near kindred; by the soul and memory of

Henry VII., the common ancestor of both; and by the royal dignity of which

they equally participated.[*] Elizabeth made no answer to this letter;

being unwilling to give Mary a refusal in her present situation, and

foreseeing inconveniencies from granting some of her requests.

 

While the queen of Scots thus prepared herself to meet her fate, great

efforts were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the

execution of the sentence pronounced against her. Besides employing

L’Aubespine, the French resident at London, a creature of the house of

Guise, Henry sent over BelliÃ¨vre, with a professed intention of

interceding for the life of Mary. The duke of Guise and the league at that

time threatened very nearly the king’s authority; and Elizabeth knew, that

though that monarch might, from decency and policy, think himself obliged

to interpose publicly in behalf of the queen of Scots, he could not

secretly be much displeased with the death of a princess, on whose fortune

and elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many daring and

ambitious projects.[*] It is even pretended, that Bellievre had orders,

after making public and vehement remonstrances against the execution of

Mary, to exhort privately the queen, in his master’s name, not to defer an

act of justice so necessary for their common safety.[**] But whether the

French king’s intercession were sincere or not, it had no weight with the

queen; and she still persisted in her former resolution.

 

The interposition of the young king of Scots, though not able to change

Elizabeth’s determination, seemed on every account to merit more regard.

As soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his mother, he

sent Sir William Keith, a gentleman of his bed-chamber, to London; and

wrote a letter to the queen, in which he remonstrated in very severe terms

against the indignity of the procedure. He said, that he was astonished to

hear of the presumption of English noblemen and counsellors, who had dared

to sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a queen of Scotland, descended

from the blood royal of England; but he was still more astonished to hear,

that thoughts were seriously entertained of putting that sentence in

execution: that he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on the dishonor which

she would draw on her name by imbruing her hands in the blood of her near

kinswoman, a person of the same royal dignity and of the same sex with

herself: that, in this unparalleled attempt, she offered an affront to all

diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing sovereigns to a level with

other men, taught the people to neglect all duty towards those whom

Providence had appointed to rule over them: that for his part, he must

deem the injury and insult so enormous, as to be incapable of all

atonement; nor was it possible for him thenceforward to remain in any

terms of correspondence with a person who, without any pretence of legal

authority, had deliberately inflicted an ignominious death upon his

parent: and that, even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not

inspire him with this purpose of vengeance, his honor required it of him;

nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world, if he did not

use every effort, and endure every hazard, to revenge so great an

indignity.[*]

 

Soon after, James sent the master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce

the remonstrances of Keith, and to employ with the queen every expedient

of argument and menaces. Elizabeth was at first offended with the

sharpness of these applications; and she replied in a like strain to the

Scottish ambassadors. When she afterwards reflected, that this earnestness

was no more than what duty required of James, she was pacified; but still

retained her resolution of executing the sentence against Mary.[**] It is

believed, that the master of Gray, gained by the enemies of that princess,

secretly gave his advice not to spare her, and undertook, in all events,

to pacify his master.

 

The queen also, from many considerations, was induced to pay small

attention to the applications of James, and to disregard all the efforts

which he could employ in behalf of his mother. She was well acquainted

with his character and interests, the factions which prevailed among his

people, and the inveterate hatred which the zealous Protestants,

particularly the preachers, bore to the queen of Scots. The present

incidents set these dispositions of the clergy in a full light. James,

observing the fixed purpose of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be offered up

for Mary in all the churches; and knowing the captious humor of the

ecclesiastics, he took care that the form of the petition should be most

cautious, as well as humane and charitable: “That it might please God to

illuminate Mary with the light of his truth, and save her from the

apparent danger with which she was threatened.” But, excepting the king’s

own chaplains, and one clergyman more, all the preachers refused to

pollute their churches by prayers for a Papist, and would not so much as

prefer a petition for her conversion. James, unwilling or unable to punish

this disobedience, and desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of

amending their fault, appointed a new day when prayers should be said for

his mother; and that he might at least secure himself from any insult in

his own presence, he desired the archbishop of St. Andrews to officiate

before him.

 

In order to disappoint this purpose, the clergy instigated one Couper, a

young man who had not yet received holy orders, to take possession of the

pulpit early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the king

came to church, and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he called to him

from his seat, and told him, that the place was destined for another; yet

since he was there, if he would obey the charge given, and remember the

queen in his prayers, he might proceed to divine service. The preacher

replied, that he would do as the Spirit of God should direct him. This

answer sufficiently instructed James in his purpose; and he commanded him

to leave the pulpit. As Couper seemed not disposed to obey, the captain of

the guard went to pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried

aloud, that this day would be a witness against the king in the great day

of the Lord; and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for

permitting him to be treated in that manner.[*] The audience at first

appeared desirous to take part with him; but the sermon of the prelate

brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane disposition.

 

Elizabeth, when solicited, either by James or by foreign princes, to

pardon the queen of Scots, seemed always determined to execute the

sentence against her: but when her ministers urged her to interpose no

more delays, her scruples and her hesitation returned; her humanity could

not allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary measures; and she was

touched with compassion for the misfortunes, and with respect for the

dignity, of the unhappy prisoner. The courtiers, sensible that they could

do nothing more acceptable to her than to employ persuasion on this head,

failed not to enforce every motive for the punishment of Mary, and to

combat all the objections urged against this act of justice. They said,

that the treatment of that princess in England had been, on her first

reception, such as sound reason and policy required; and if she had been

governed by principles of equity, she would not have refused willingly to

acquiesce in it: that the obvious inconveniencies, either of allowing her

to retire into France, or of restoring her by force to her throne, in

opposition to the reformers and the English party in Scotland, had obliged

the queen to detain her in England, till time should offer some

opportunity of serving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to the

Protestant religion that her usage there had been such as became her rank;

her own servants, in considerable numbers, had been permitted to attend

her, exercise had been allowed her for health, and all access of company

for amusement; and these indulgences would, in time, have been carried

further, if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of them:

that after she had instigated the rebellion of Northumberland, the

conspiracy of Norfolk, the bull of excommunication of Pope Pius, an

invasion from Flanders; after she had seduced the queen’s friends, and

incited every enemy, foreign and domestic, against her; it became

necessary to treat her as a most dangerous rival, and to render her

confinement more strict and rigorous: that the queen, notwithstanding

these repeated provocations, had, in her favor, rejected the importunity

of her parliaments, and the advice of her sagest ministers;[*] and was

still, in hopes of her amendment, determined to delay coming to the last

extremities against her: that Mary, even in this forlorn condition,

retained so high and unconquerable a spirit, that she acted as competitor

to the crown, and allowed her partisans every where, and in their very

letters addressed to herself, to treat her as queen of England: that she

had carried her animosity so far as to encourage, in repeated instances,

the atrocious design of assassinating the queen; and this crime was

unquestionably proved upon her by her own letters, by the evidence of her

secretaries, and by the dying confession of her accomplices; that she was

but a titular queen, and at present possessed nowhere any right of

sovereignty; much less in England, where, the moment she set foot in the

kingdom, she voluntarily became subject to the laws, and to Elizabeth, the

only true sovereign; that even allowing her to be still the queen’s equal

in rank and dignity, self-defence was permitted by a law of nature which

could never be abrogated: and every one, still more a queen, had

sufficient jurisdiction over an enemy, who, by open violence, and still

more, who, by secret treachery, threatened the utmost danger against her

life; that the general combination of the Catholics to exterminate the

Protestants was no longer a secret; and as the sole resource of the latter

persecuted sect lay in Elizabeth, so the chief hope which the former

entertained of final success consisted in the person and in the title of

the queen of Scots; that this very circumstance brought matters to

extremity between these princesses; and rendering the life of one the

death of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth the path which either regard

to self-preservation, or to the happiness of her people, should direct her

to pursue: and that necessity, more powerful than policy, thus demanded of

the queen that resolution which equity would authorize, and which duty

prescribed.[**]

 

1587.

 

When Elizabeth thought that as many importunities had been used, and as

much delay interposed, as decency required, she at last determined to

carry the sentence into execution: but even in this final resolution she

could not proceed without displaying a new scene of duplicity and

artifice. In order to alarm the vulgar, rumors were previously dispersed,

that the Spanish fleet was arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots had

made an irruption into England; that the duke of Guise was landed in

Sussex with a strong army; that the queen of Scots was escaped from

prison, and had raised an army; that the northern counties had begun an

insurrection; that there was a new conspiracy on foot to assassinate the

queen, and set the city of London on fire; nay, that the queen was

actually assassinated.[*] An attempt of this nature was even imputed to

L’Aubespine, the French ambassador; and that minister was obliged to leave

the kingdom. The queen, affecting to be in terror and perplexity, was

observed to sit much alone, pensive and silent; and sometimes to mutter to

herself half sentences, importing the difficulty and distress to which she

was reduced.[**]

 

She at last called Davison, a man of parts, but easy to be imposed on, and

who had lately for that very reason been made secretary, and she ordered

him privately to draw a warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots;

which, she afterwards said, she intended to keep by her, in case any

attempt should be made for the deliverance of that princess. She signed

the warrant; and then commanded Davison to carry it to the chancellor, in

order to have the great seal appended to it. Next day she sent Killigrew

to Davison, enjoining him to forbear, some time, executing her former

orders; and when Davison came and told her that the warrant had already

passed the great seal, she seemed to be somewhat moved, and blamed him for

his precipitation. Davison, being in perplexity, acquainted the council

with this whole transaction; and they endeavored to persuade him to send

off Beale with the warrant: if the queen should be displeased, they

promised to justify his conduct, and to take on themselves the whole blame

of this measure.[*] The secretary, not sufficiently aware of their

intention, complied with the advice; and the warrant was despatched to the

earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, and some others, ordering them to see the

sentence executed upon the queen of Scots.

 

The two earls came to Fotheringay Castle, and being introduced to Mary,

informed her of their commission, and desired her to prepare for death

next morning at eight o’clock. She seemed nowise terrified, though

somewhat surprised, with the intelligence. She said with a cheerful, and

even a smiling countenance, that she did not think the queen, her sister,

would have consented to her death, or have executed the sentence against a

person not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of England. “But as such

is her will,” said she, “death, which puts an end to all my miseries,

shall be to me most welcome; nor can I esteem that soul worthy the

felicities of heaven, which cannot support the body under the horrors of

the last passage to these blissful mansions.”[**] She then requested the

two noblemen, that they would permit some of her servants, and

particularly her confessor, to attend her; but they told her, that

compliance with this last demand was contrary to their conscience; [***]

and that Dr. Fletcher, dean of Peterborough, a man of great learning,

should be present to instruct her in the principles of true religion. Her

refusal to have any conference with this divine inflamed the zeal of the

earl of Kent; and he bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of

their religion; as, on the contrary, her life would have been the death of

it. Mention being made of Babington, she constantly denied his conspiracy

to have been at all known to her; and the revenge of her wrongs she

resigned into the hands of the Almighty.

 

When the earls had left her, she ordered supper to be hastened, that she

might have the more leisure after it to finish the few affairs which

remained to her in this world, and to prepare for her passage to another.

It was necessary for her, she said, to take some sustenance, lest a

failure of her bodily strength should depress her spirits on the morrow,

and lest her behavior should thereby betray a weakness unworthy of

herself.[*] She supped sparingly, as her manner usually was; and her

wonted cheerfulness did not even desert her on this occasion. She

comforted her servants under the affliction which overwhelmed them, and

which was too violent for them to conceal it from her. Turning to Burgoin,

her physician, she asked him, whether he did not remark the great and

invincible force of truth. “They pretend,” said she, “that I must die,

because I conspired against their queen’s life: but the earl of Kent

avowed, that there was no other cause of my death, than the apprehensions

which, if I should live, they entertain for their religion. My constancy

in the faith is my real crime: the rest is only a color, invented by

interested and designing men.” Towards the end of supper, she called in

all her servants, and drank to them: they pledged her, in order, on their

knees; and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty: she

deigned, in return, to ask their pardon for her offences towards them; and

a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewell, and

exchange of mutual forgiveness.[**]

 

Mary’s care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which employed

her concern. She perused her will, in which she had provided for them by

legacies: she ordered the inventory of her goods, clothes, and jewels to

be brought her: and she wrote down the names of those to whom she

bequeathed each particular: to some she distributed money with her own

hands; and she adapted the recompense to their different degrees of rank

and merit. She wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to

the French king, and to her cousin the duke of Guise, whom she made the

chief executor of her testament. At her wonted time, she went to bed;

slept some hours; and, then rising, spent the rest of the night in prayer.

Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion,

she had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of

Pope Pius; and she had reserved the use of it for this last period of her

life. By this expedient she supplied, as much as she could, the want of a

priest and confessor, who was refused her.[*]

 

Towards the morning, she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and

velvet, the only one which she had reserved to herself. She told her

maids, that she would willingly have left them this dress, rather than the

plain garb which she wore the day before: but it was necessary for her to

appear at the ensuing solemnity in a decent habit.

 

Thomas Andrews, sheriff of the county, entered the room, and informed her

that the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the place of

execution. She replied, that she was ready; and bidding adieu to her

servants, she leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet’s guards, because of an

infirmity in her limbs; and she followed the sheriff with a serene and

composed countenance. In passing through a hall adjoining to her chamber,

she was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir

Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of distinction. Here she also found

Sir Andrew Melvil, her steward, who flung himself on his knees before her;

and wringing his hands, cried aloud, “Ah, madam! unhappy me! what man was

ever before the messenger of such heavy tidings as I must carry, when I

shall return to my native country, and shall report, that I saw my

gracious queen and mistress beheaded in England?” His tears prevented

further speech; and Mary too felt herself moved, more from sympathy than

affliction. “Cease, my good servant,” said she, “cease to lament: thou

hast cause rather to rejoice than to mourn: for now shalt thou see the

troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long-expected period and completion.

Know,” continued she, “good servant, that all the world at best is vanity,

and subject still to more sorrow than a whole ocean of tears is able to

bewail. But I pray thee carry this message from me, that I die a true

woman to my religion, and unalterable in my affections to Scotland and to

France. Heaven forgive them that have long desired my end, and have

thirsted for my blood as the hart panteth after the water brooks!” “O

God,” added she, “thou art the author of truth, and truth itself; thou

knowest the inmost recesses of my heart: thou knowest that I was ever

desirous to preserve an entire union between Scotland and England, and to

obviate the source of all these fatal discords. But recommend me, Melvil,

to my son; and tell him, that notwithstanding all my distresses, I have

done nothing prejudicial to the state and kingdom of Scotland.” After

these words, reclining herself, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with

tears, she kissed him. “And so,” said she, “good Melvil, farewell: once

again, farewell, good Melvil; and grant the assistance of thy prayers to

thy queen and mistress.”[*]

 

She next turned to the noblemen, who attended her, and made a petition in

behalf of her servants, that they might be well treated, be allowed to

enjoy the presents which she had made them, and be sent safely into their

own country. Having received a favorable answer, she preferred another

request, that they might be permitted to attend her at her death; “in

order,” said she, “that their eyes may behold, and their hearts bear

witness, how patiently their queen and mistress can submit to her

execution, and how constantly she perseveres in her attachment to her

religion.” The earl of Kent opposed this desire, and told her that they

would be apt, by their speeches and cries, to disturb both herself and the

spectators: he was also apprehensive lest they should practise some

superstition, not meet for him to suffer; such as dipping their

handkerchiefs in her blood: for that was the instance which he made use

of. “My lord,” said the queen of Scots, “I will give my word (although it

be but dead) that they shall not incur any blame in any of the actions

which you have named. But alas! poor souls! it would be a great

consolation to them to bid their mistress farewell. And I hope,” added

she, “that your mistress, being a maiden queen, would vouchsafe, in regard

of womanhood, that I should have some of my own people about me at my

death. I know that her majesty hath not given you any such strict command,

but that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy, even though

I were a woman of inferior rank to that which I bear.” Finding that the

earl of Kent persisted still in his refusal, her mind, which had fortified

itself against the terrors of death, was affected by this indignity, for

which she was not prepared. “I am cousin to your queen,” cried she, “and

descended from the blood royal of Henry VII., and a married queen of

France, and an anointed queen of Scotland.” The commissioners, perceiving

how invidious their obstinacy would appear, conferred a little together,

and agreed that she might carry a few of her servants along with her. She

made choice of four men and two maid servants for that purpose.

 

She then passed into another hall, where was erected the scaffold, covered

with black; and she saw, with an undismayed countenance, the executioners

and all the preparations of death. The room was crowded with spectators;

and no one was so steeled against all sentiments of humanity, as not to be

moved, when he reflected on her royal dignity, considered the surprising

train of her misfortunes, beheld her mild but inflexible constancy,

recalled her amiable accomplishments, or surveyed her beauties, which,

though faded by years, and yet more by her afflictions, still discovered

themselves in this fatal moment. Here the warrant for her execution was

read to her; and during this ceremony she was silent, but showed, in her

behavior, an indifference and unconcern, as if the business had nowise

regarded her. Before the executioners performed their office, the dean of

Peterborough stepped forth; and though the queen frequently told him that

he needed not concern himself about her, that she was settled in the

ancient Catholic and Roman religion, and that she meant to lay down her

life in defence of that faith, he still thought it his duty to persist in

his lectures and exhortations, and to endeavor her conversion. The terms

which he employed were, under color of pious instructions, cruel insults

on her unfortunate situation; and besides their own absurdity, may be

regarded as the most mortifying indignities to which she had ever yet been

exposed. He told her, that the queen of England had on this occasion shown

a tender care of her; and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be

inflicted on her, for her manifold trespasses, was determined to use every

expedient for saving her soul from that destruction with which it was so

nearly threatened: that she was now standing upon the brink of eternity,

and had no other means of escaping endless perdition, than by repenting

her former wickedness, by justifying the sentence pronounced against her,

by acknowledging the queen’s favors, and by exerting a true and lively

faith in Christ Jesus: that the Scriptures were the only rule of doctrine,

the merits of Christ the only means of salvation; and if she trusted in

the inventions or devices of men, she must expect in an instant to fall

into utter darkness, into a place where shall be weeping howling, and

gnashing of teeth: that the and of death was upon her, the axe was laid to

the root of the tree, the throne of the great Judge of heaven was erected,

the book of her life was spread wide, and the particular sentence and

judgment was ready to be pronounced upon her: and that it was now, during

this important moment, in her choice, either to rise to the resurrection

of life, and hear that joyful salutation, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,”

or to share the resurrection of condemnation, replete with sorrow and

anguish; and to suffer that dreadful denunciation, “Go, ye cursed, into

everlasting fire.”[*]

 

During this discourse, Mary could not sometimes forbear betraying her

impatience, by interrupting the preacher; and the dean, finding that he

had profited nothing by his lecture, at last bade her change her opinion,

repent her of her former wickedness, and settle her faith upon this

ground, that only in Christ Jesus could she hope to be saved. She

answered, again and again, with great earnestness, “Trouble not yourself

any more about the matter; for I was born in this religion, I have lived

in this religion, and in this religion I am resolved to die.” Even the two

earls perceived that it was fruitless to harass her any further with

theological disputes; and they ordered the dean to desist from his

unseasonable exhortations, and to pray for her conversion. During the

dean’s prayer, she employed herself in private devotion from the office of

the Virgin; and after he had finished, she pronounced aloud some petitions

in English, for the afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for

her son, and for Queen Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that princess might

long prosper, and be employed in his service. The earl of Kent, observing

that in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix, could not

forbear reproving her for her attachment to that Popish trumpery, as he

termed it; and he exhorted her to have Christ in her heart, not in her

hand.[**] She replied, with presence of mind, that it was difficult to

hold such an object in her hand without feeling her heart touched with

some compunction.[***]

 

She now began, with the aid of her two women, to disrobe herself; and the

executioner also lent his hand to assist them. She smiled, and said that

she was not accustomed to undress herself before so large a company, nor

to be served by such valets. Her servants, seeing her in this condition,

ready to lay her head upon the block, burst into tears and lamentations:

she turned about to them; put her finger upon her lips, as a sign of

imposing silence upon them;[*] and having given them her blessing, desired

them to pray for her.

 

One of her maids, whom she had appointed for that purpose, covered her

eyes with a handkerchief; she laid herself down without any sign of fear

or trepidation, and her head was severed from her body at two strokes by

the executioner. He instantly held it up to the spectators, streaming with

blood, and agitated with the convulsions of death: the dean of

Peterborough alone exclaimed, “So perish all Queen Elizabeth’s enemies:”

the earl of Kent alone replied, “Amen:” the attention of all the other

spectators was fixed on the melancholy scene before them; and zeal and

flattery alike gave place to present pity and admiration of the expiring

princess.

 

Thus perished, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and nineteenth of her

captivity in England, Mary, queen of Scots; a woman of great

accomplishments both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but

unfortunate in her life, and during one period very unhappy in her

conduct. The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make

her the most amiable of women; and the charms of her address and

conversation aided the impression which her lovely figure made on the

hearts of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet inclined

to cheerfulness and society; of a lofty spirit, constant and even vehement

in her purpose, yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her demeanor; she

seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her

estimable, without relinquishing those soft graces which compose the

proper ornament of her sex. In order to form a just idea of her character,

we must set aside one part of her conduct, while she abandoned herself to

the guidance of a profligate man; and must consider these faults, whether

we admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the result of an

inexplicable, though not uncommon inconstancy in the human mind of the

frailty of our nature, of the violence of passion, and of the influence

which situations, and sometimes momentary incidents, have on persons whose

principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and reflection.

Enraged by the ungrateful conduct of her husband, seduced by the

treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence, transported by

the violence of her own temper, which never lay sufficiently under the

guidance of discretion; she was betrayed into actions which may with some

difficulty be accounted for, but which admit of no apology, nor even of

alleviation. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the appearance of

a panegyric; an account of her conduct must, in some parts, wear the

aspect of severe satire and invective.

 

Her numerous misfortunes, the solitude of her long and tedious captivity,

and the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account of her

religion, had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during her later

years; and such were the prevalent spirit and principles of the age, that

it is the less wonder, if her zeal, her resentment, and her interest

uniting, induced her to give consent to a design which conspirators,

actuated only by the first of these motives, had formed against the life

of Elizabeth.

 

When the queen was informed of Mary’s execution, she affected the utmost

surprise and indignation. Her countenance changed; her speech faltered and

failed her; for a long time, her sorrow was so deep that she could not

express it, but stood fixed, like a statue, in silence and mute

astonishment. After her grief was able to find vent, it burst out in loud

wailings and lamentations; she put herself in deep mourning for this

deplorable event; and she was seen perpetually bathed in tears, and

surrounded only by her maids and women. None of her ministers or

counsellors dared to approach her; or if any had such temerity, she chased

them from her, with the most violent expressions of rage and resentment;

they had all of them been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in putting to

death her dear sister and kinswoman, contrary to her fixed purpose,[*] of

which they were sufficiently apprised and acquainted.

 

No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room for reflection,

than she wrote a letter of apology to the king of Scots, and sent it by

Sir Robert Cary, son of Lord Hunsdon. She there told him, that she wished

he knew but not felt, the unutterable grief which she experienced on

account of that lamentable accident which, without her knowledge, much

less concurrence, had happened in England: that as her pen trembled when

she attempted to write it, she found herself obliged to commit the

relation of it to the messenger her kinsman; who would likewise inform his

majesty of every circumstance attending this dismal and unlooked-for

misfortune: that she appealed to the supreme Judge of heaven and earth for

her innocence; and was also so happy amidst her other afflictions, as to

find, that many persons in her court could bear witness to her veracity in

this protestation: that she abhorred dissimulation; deemed nothing more

worthy of a prince than a sincere and open conduct; and could never surely

be esteemed so base and poor-spirited as that, if she had really given

orders for this fatal execution, she could on any consideration be induced

to deny them: that, though sensible of the justice of the sentence

pronounced against the unhappy prisoner, she determined from clemency

never to carry it into execution; and could not but resent the temerity of

those who on this occasion had disappointed her intention: and that as no

one loved him more dearly than herself, or bore a more anxious concern for

his welfare, she hoped that he would consider every one as his enemy who

endeavored, on account of the present incident, to excite any animosity

between them.[*]

 

In order the better to appease James, she committed Davison to prison, and

ordered him to be tried in the star chamber for his misdemeanor. The

secretary was confounded; and being sensible of the danger which must

attend his entering into a contest with the queen, he expressed penitence

for his error, and submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very

counsellors whose persuasion had induced him to incur the guilt, and who

had promised to countenance and protect him. He was condemned to

imprisonment during the queen’s pleasure, and to pay a fine of ten

thousand pounds. He remained a long time in custody; and the fine, though

it reduced him to beggary, was rigorously levied upon him. All the favor

which he could obtain from the queen, was sending him small supplies from

time to time, to keep him from perishing in necessity.[**]

 

He privately wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham, which contains

many curious particulars. The French and Scotch ambassadors, he said, had

been remonstrating with the queen in Mary’s behalf; and immediately after

their departure, she commanded him, of her own accord to deliver her the

warrant for the execution of that princess. She signed it readily, and

ordered it to be sealed with the great seal of England. She appeared in

such good humour on the occasion, that she said to him in a jocular

manner, “Go, tell all this to Walsingham, who is now sick; though I fear

he will die of sorrow when he hears of it.” She added, that though she had

so long delayed the execution, lest she should seem to be actuated by

malice or cruelty, she was all along sensible of the necessity of it. In

the same conversation, she blamed Drury and Paulet that they had not

before eased her of this trouble; and she expressed her desire that

Walsingham would bring them to compliance in that particular. She was so

bent on this purpose, that some time after she asked Davison whether any

letter had come from Paulet with regard to the service expected of him.

Davison showed her Paulet’s letter, in which that gentleman positively

refused to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of honor and

justice. The queen fell into a passion, and accused Paulet as well as

Drury of perjury; because, having taken the oath of association, in which

they had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs, they had yet refused to

lend their hand on this occasion. “But others,” she said, “will be found

less scrupulous.” Davison adds, that nothing but the consent and

exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him to send off the

warrant: he was well aware of his danger; and remembered that the queen,

after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had endeavored,

in a like manner, to throw the whole blame and odium of that action upon

Lord Burleigh.[*]

 

Elizabeth’s dissimulation was so gross, that it could deceive nobody who

was not previously resolved to be blinded; but as James’s concern for his

mother was certainly more sincere and cordial, he discovered the highest

resentment, and refused to admit Cary into his presence. He recalled his

ambassadors from England, and seemed to breathe nothing but war and

vengeance. The states of Scotland, being assembled, took part in his

anger; and professed that they were ready to spend their lives and

fortunes in revenge of his mother’s death, and in defence of his title to

the crown of England. Many of his nobility instigated him to take arms:

Lord Sinclair, when the courtiers appeared in deep mourning, presented

himself to the king arrayed in complete armor and said, that this was the

proper mourning for the queen. The Catholics took the opportunity of

exhorting James to make an alliance with the king of Spain, to lay

immediate claim to the crown of England, and to prevent the ruin which,

from his mother’s example, he might conclude would certainly, if

Elizabeth’s power prevailed, overwhelm his person and his kingdom. The

queen was sensible of the danger attending these counsels; and after

allowing James some decent interval to vent his grief and anger, she

employed her emissaries to pacify him, and to set before him every motive

of hope or fear which might induce him to live in amity with her.

 

Walsingham wrote to Lord Thirlstone, James’s secretary, a judicious letter

to the same purpose. He said that he was much surprised to hear of the

violent resolutions taken in Scotland, and of the passion discovered by a

prince of so much judgment and temper as James: that a war, founded merely

on the principle of revenge, and that, too, on account of an act of

justice which necessity had extorted, would for ever be exposed to

censure, and could not be excused by any principles of equity or reason:

that if these views were deemed less momentous among princes, policy and

interest ought certainly to be attended to; and these motives did still

more evidently oppose all thoughts of a rupture with Elizabeth, and all

revival of exploded claims to the English throne: that the inequality

between the two kingdoms deprived James of any hopes of success, if he

trusted merely to the force of his own state, and had no recourse to

foreign powers for assistance: that the objections attending the

introduction of succors from a more potent monarch, appeared so evident

from all the transactions of history, that they could not escape a person

of the king’s extensive knowledge; but there were in the present case

several peculiar circumstances, which ought forever to deter him from

having recourse to so dangerous an expedient: that the French monarch, the

ancient ally of Scotland, might willingly use the assistance of that

kingdom against England, but would be displeased to see the union of these

two kingdoms in the person of James; a union which would ever after

exclude him from practising that policy, formerly so useful to the French,

and so pernicious to the Scottish nation: that Henry, besides, infested

with faction and domestic war, was not in a condition of supporting

distant allies, much less would he expose himself to any hazard or

expense, in order to aggrandize a near kinsman of the house of Guise, the

most determined enemies of his repose and authority: that the extensive

power and exorbitant ambition of the Spanish monarch rendered him a still

more dangerous ally to Scotland; and as he evidently aspired to a

universal monarchy in the west, and had in particular advanced some claims

to England as if he were descended from the house of Lancaster, he was at

the same time the common enemy of all princes who wished to maintain their

independence, and the immediate rival and competitor of the king of Scots:

that the queen by her own naval power and her alliance with the

Hollanders, would probably intercept all succors which might be sent to

James from abroad, and be enabled to decide the controversy in this

island, with the superior forces of her own kingdom, opposed to those of

Scotland: that if the king revived his mother’s pretensions to the crown

of England, he must also embrace her religion, by which alone they could

be justified; and must thereby undergo the infamy of abandoning those

principles in which he had been strictly educated; and to which he had

hitherto religiously adhered: that as he would, by such an apostasy,

totally alienate all the Protestants in Scotland and England, he could

never gain the confidence of the Catholics, who would still entertain

reasonable doubts of his sincerity: that by advancing a present claim to

the crown, he forfeited the certain prospect of his succession; and

revived that national animosity which the late peace and alliance between

the kingdoms had happily extinguished: that the whole gentry and nobility

of England had openly declared themselves for the execution of the queen

of Scots; and if James showed such violent resentment against that act of

justice, they would be obliged, for their own security, to prevent forever

so implacable a prince from ruling over them: and that, however some

persons might represent his honor as engaged to seek vengeance for the

present affront and injury, the true honor of a prince consisted in

wisdom, and moderation, and justice, not in following the dictates of

blind passion, or in pursuing revenge at the expense of every motive and

every interest.[*]

 

These considerations, joined to the peaceable, unambitious temper of the

young prince, prevailed over his resentment, and he fell gradually into a

good correspondence with the court of England. It is probable that the

queen’s chief object in her dissimulation with regard to the execution of

Mary, was, that she might thereby afford James a decent pretence for

renewing his amity with her, on which their mutual interests so much

depended.

 

While Elizabeth insured tranquillity from the attempts of her nearest

neighbor, she was not negligent of more distant dangers. Hearing that

Philip, though he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries which

he received from the English, was secretly preparing a great navy to

attack her, she sent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet to intercept his

supplies, to pillage his coast, and to destroy his shipping. Drake carried

out four capital ships of the queen’s, and twenty-six, great and small,

with which the London merchants, in hopes of sharing in the plunder, had

supplied him. Having learned from two Dutch ships which he met with in his

passage, that a Spanish fleet, richly laden, was lying at Cadiz, ready to

sail for Lisbon, the rendezvous of the intended armada, he bent his course

to the former harbor, and boldly, as well as fortunately, made an attack

on the enemy. He obliged six galleys, which made head against him, to take

shelter under the forts: he burned about a hundred vessels laden with

ammunition and naval stores; and he destroyed a great ship of the marquis

of Santa Croce. Thence he set sail for Cape St. Vincent, and took by

assault the castle situated on that promontory, with three other

fortresses. He next insulted Lisbon; and finding that the merchants, who

had engaged entirely in expectation of profit, were discontented at these

military enterprises, he set sail for the Terceras, with an intention of

lying in wait for a rich carrack, which was expected in those parts. He

was so fortunate as to meet with his prize; and by this short expedition,

in which the public bore so small a share, the adventurers were encouraged

to attempt further enterprises, the English seamen learned to despise the

great unwieldy ships of the enemy, the naval preparations of Spain were

destroyed, the intended expedition against England was retarded a

twelvemonth, and the queen thereby had leisure to take more secure

measures against that formidable invasion.[*]

 

This year, Thomas Cavendish, a gentleman of Devonshire, who had dissipated

a good estate by living at court, being resolved to repair his fortune at

the expense of the Spaniards fitted out three ships at Plymouth one of a

hundred and twenty tons, another of sixty, and a third of forty; and with

these small vessels he ventured into the South Sea, and committed great

depredations on the Spaniards. He took nineteen vessels, some of which

were richly laden; and returning by the Cape of Good Hope, he came to

London, and entered the river in a kind of triumph. His mariners and

soldiers were clothed in silk, his sails were of damask, his topsail cloth

of gold; and his prizes were esteemed the richest that ever had been

brought into England.[*]

 

The land enterprises of the English were not, during this campaign, so

advantageous or honorable to the nation. The important place of Deventer

was intrusted by Leicester to William Stanley, with a garrison of twelve

hundred English; and this gentleman, being a Catholic, was alarmed at the

discovery of Babington’s conspiracy, and became apprehensive lest every

one of his religion should thenceforth be treated with distrust in

England. He entered into a correspondence with the Spaniards, betrayed the

city to them for a sum of money, and engaged the whole garrison to desert

with him to the Spanish service. Roland York, who commanded a fort near

Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders, formerly disgusted with

Leicester, and suspicious of the English, broke out into loud complaints

against the improvidence, if not the treachery, of his administration.

Soon after, he himself arrived in the Low Countries; but his conduct was

nowise calculated to give them satisfaction, or to remove the suspicions

which they had entertained against him. The prince of Parma having

besieged Sluys, Leicester attempted to relieve the place, first by sea,

then by land; but failed in both enterprises; and as he ascribed his bad

success to the ill behavior of the Hollanders, they were equally free in

reflections upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every

day: they slighted his authority, opposed his measures, and neglected his

counsels; while he endeavored by an imperious behavior, and by violence,

to recover that influence which he had lost by his imprudent and

ill-concerted measures. He was even suspected by the Dutch of a design to

usurp upon their liberties; and the jealousy entertained against him began

to extend towards the queen herself. That princess had made some advances

towards a peace with Spain: a congress had been opened at Bourbourg, a

village near Graveline: and though the two courts, especially that of

Spain, had no other intention than to amuse each of them its enemy by

negotiation, and mutually relax the preparations for defence or attack,

the Dutch, who were determined on no terms to return under the Spanish

yoke, became apprehensive lest their liberty should be sacrificed to the

political interests of England.[*] But the queen, who knew the importance

of her alliance with the states during the present conjuncture, was

resolved to give them entire satisfaction, by recalling Leicester, and

commanding him to resign his government. Maurice son of the late prince of

Orange, a youth of twenty years of age, was elected by the states governor

in his place; and Peregrine Lord Willoughby was appointed by the queen

commander of the English forces. The measures of these two generals were

much embarrassed by the malignity of Leicester, who had left a faction

behind him, and who still attempted, by means of his emissaries, to

disturb all the operations of the states. As soon as Elizabeth received

intelligence of these disorders, she took care to redress them; and she

obliged all the partisans of England to fall into unanimity with Prince

Maurice.[**] But though her good sense so far prevailed over her

partiality to Leicester, she never could be made fully sensible of his

vices and incapacity: the submissions which he made her restored him to

her wonted favor; and Lord Buckhurst, who had accused him of misconduct in

Holland, lost her confidence for some time, and was even committed to

custody.

 

Sir Christopher Hatton was another favorite who at this time received some

marks of her partiality. Though he had never followed the profession of

the law, he was made chancellor, in the place of Bromley, deceased; but,

notwithstanding all the expectations, and perhaps wishes of the lawyers,

he behaved in a manner not unworthy of that high station: his good natural

capacity supplied the place of experience and study; and his decisions

were not found deficient, either in point of equity or judgment. His

enemies had contributed to this promotion, in hopes that his absence from

court, while he attended the business of chancery, would gradually

estrange the queen from him, and give them an opportunity of undermining

him in her favor.

 

1568.

 

These little intrigues and cabals of the court were silenced by the

account which came from all quarters, of the vast preparations made by the

Spaniards for the invasion of England, and for the entire conquest of that

kingdom. Philip, though he had not yet declared war on account of the

hostilities which Elizabeth every where committed upon him, had long

harbored a secret and violent desire of revenge against her. His ambition

also, and the hopes of extending his empire, were much encouraged by the

present prosperous state of his affairs; by the conquest of Portugal, the

acquisition of the East Indian commerce and settlements, and the yearly

importation of vast treasures from America. The point on which he rested,

his highest glory, the perpetual object of his policy, was to support

orthodoxy and exterminate heresy; and as the power and credit of Elizabeth

were the chief bulwark of the Protestants, he hoped, if he could subdue

that princess, to acquire the eternal renown of reuniting the whole

Christian world in the Catholic communion. Above all, his indignation

against his revolted subjects in the Netherlands instigated him to attack

the English, who had encouraged that insurrection; and who, by their

vicinity, were so well enabled to support the Hollanders, that he could

never hope to reduce these rebels, while the power of that kingdom

remained entire and unbroken. To subdue England seemed a necessary

preparative to the reestablishment of his authority in the Netherlands;

and notwithstanding appearances, the former was in itself, as a more

important, so a more easy undertaking than the latter. That kingdom lay

nearer Spain than the Low Countries, and was more exposed to invasions

from that quarter; after an enemy had once obtained entrance, the

difficulty seemed to be over, as it was neither fortified by an or nature;

a long peace had deprived it of all military discipline and experience;

and the Catholics, in which it still abounded, would be ready, it was

hoped, to join any invader who should free them from those persecutions

under which they labored, and should revenge the death of the queen of

Scots, on whom they had fixed all their affections. The fate of England

must be decided in one battle at sea, and another at land; and what

comparison between the English and Spaniards, either in point of naval

force, or in the numbers, reputation, and veteran bravery of their armies?

Besides the acquisition of so great a kingdom, success against England

insured the immediate subjection of the Hollanders, who, attacked on every

hand, and deprived of all support, must yield their stubborn necks to that

yoke which they had so long resisted. Happily, this conquest, as it was of

the utmost importance to the grandeur of Spain, would not at present be

opposed by the jealousy of other powers, naturally so much interested to

prevent the success of the enterprise. A truce was lately concluded with

the Turks; the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally; and

France, the perpetual rival of Spain, was so torn with intestine

commotions, that she had no leisure to pay attention to her foreign

interests. This favorable opportunity, therefore, which might never again

present itself, must be seized; and one bold effort made for acquiring

that ascendant in Europe, to which the present greatness and prosperity of

the Spaniards seemed so fully to entitle them.[*]

 

These hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwithstanding his cautious

temper, to undertake this hazardous enterprise; and though the prince, now

created by the pope duke of Parma, when consulted, opposed the attempt, at

least represented the necessity of previously getting possession of some

seaport town in the Netherlands, which might afford a retreat to the

Spanish navy,[**] it was determined by the Catholic monarch to proceed

immediately to the execution of his ambitious project.

 

During some time, he had been secretly making preparations, out as soon as

the resolution was fully taken, every part of his vast empire resounded

with the noise of armaments, and all his ministers, generals, and admirals

were employed in forwarding the design. The marquis of Santa Croce, a sea

officer of great reputation and experience, was destined to command the

fleet; and by his counsels were the naval equipments conducted. In all the

ports of Sicily, Naples, Spain, and Portugal, artisans were employed in

building vessels of uncommon size and force; naval stores were bought at a

great expense; provisions amassed; armies levied and quartered in the

maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out such a fleet and

embarkation as had never before had its equal in Europe. The military

preparations in Flanders were no less formidable. Troops from all quarters

were every moment assembling to reÃ«nforce the duke of Parma. Capizuchi and

Spinelli conducted forces from Italy: the marquis of Borgaut, a prince of

the house of Austria, levied troops in Germany; the Walloon and Burgundian

regiments were completed or augmented: the Spanish infantry was supplied

with recruits and an army of thirty-four thousand men was assembled in the

Netherlands, and kept in readiness to be transported into England. The

duke of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he could procure, either in

Flanders or in Lower Germany and the coasts of the Baltic; and he built at

Dunkirk and Newport, but especially at Antwerp, a great number of boats

and flat-bottomed vessels, for the transporting of his infantry and

cavalry. The most renowned nobility and princes of Italy and Spain were

ambitious of sharing in the honor of this great enterprise. Don Amadseus

of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Vespasian Gonzaga, duke of Sabionetta, and

the duke of Pastrana, hastened to join the army under the duke of Parma.

About two thousand volunteers in Spain, many of them men of family, had

enlisted in the service. No doubts were entertained but such vast

preparations, conducted by officers of such consummate skill, must finally

be successful. And the Spaniards, ostentatious of their power, and elated

with vain hopes, had already denominated their navy the Invincible Armada.

 

News of these extraordinary preparations soon reached the court of London;

and notwithstanding the secrecy of the Spanish council, and their

pretending to employ this force in the Indies, it was easily concluded

that they meant to make some effort against England. The queen had

foreseen the invasion; and finding that she must now contend for her crown

with the whole force of Spain, she made preparations for resistance; nor

was she dismayed with that power, by which all Europe apprehended she must

of necessity be overwhelmed. Her force, indeed, seemed very unequal to

resist so potent an enemy. All the sailors in England amounted at that

time to about fourteen thousand men.[*] The size of the English shipping

was in general so small, that except a few of the queen’s ships of war,

there were not four vessels belonging to the merchants which exceeded four

hundred tons.[**] The royal navy consisted of only twenty-eight sail,[***]

many of which were of small size; none of them exceeded the bulk of our

largest frigates, and most of them deserved rather the name of pinnaces

than of ships.

 

The only advantage of the English fleet consisted in the dexterity and

courage of the seamen, who, being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas

and expose themselves to all dangers, as much exceeded in this particular

the Spanish mariners, as their vessels were inferior in size and force to

those of that nation.[*] All the commercial towns of England were required

to furnish ships for reenforcing this small navy; and they discovered, on

the present occasion, great alacrity in defending their liberty and

religion against those imminent perils with which they were menaced. The

citizens of London, in order to show their zeal in the common cause,

instead of fifteen vessels, which they were commanded to equip,

voluntarily fitted out double the number.[**] The gentry and nobility

hired, and armed, and manned forty-three ships at their own charge;[***]

and all the loans of money which the queen demanded were frankly granted

by the persons applied to. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of courage and

capacity, was admiral, and took on him the command of the navy: Drake,

Hawkins, and Frobisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe, served under

him. The principal fleet was stationed at Plymouth. A smaller squadron,

consisting of forty vessels, English and Flemish, was commanded by Lord

Seymour, second son of Protector Somerset; and lay off Dunkirk, in order

to intercept the duke of Parma.

 

The land forces of England, compared to those of Spain, possessed contrary

qualities to its naval power: they were more numerous than the enemy, but

much inferior in discipline, reputation, and experience. An army of twenty

thousand men was disposed in different bodies along the south coast; and

orders were given them, if they could not prevent the landing of the

Spaniards, to retire backwards, to waste the country around, and to wait

for reenforcement from the neighboring counties, before they approached

the enemy. A body of twenty-two thousand foot and a thousand horse, under

the command of the earl of Leicester, was stationed at Tilbury in order to

defend the capital. The principal army consisted of thirty-four thousand

foot and two thousand horse, and was commanded by Lord Hunsdon. These

forces were reserved for guarding the queen’s person, and were appointed

to march whithersoever the enemy should appear. The fate of England, if

all the Spanish armies should be able to land, seemed to depend on the

issue of a single battle; and men of reflection entertained the most

dismal apprehensions, when they considered the force of fifty thousand

veteran Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of

Parma, the most consummate general of the age; and compared this

formidable armament with the military power which England, not enervated

by peace, but long disused to war, could muster up against it.

 

The chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in the vigor and

prudence of the queen’s conduct; who, undismayed by the present dangers,

issued all her orders with tranquillity, animated her people to a steady

resistance, and employed every resource which either her domestic

situation or her foreign alliances could afford her. She sent Sir Robert

Sidney into Scotland; and exhorted the king to remain attached to her, and

to consider the danger which at present menaced his sovereignty no less

than her own, from the ambition of the Spanish tyrant:[*] the ambassador

found James well disposed to cultivate a union with England; and that

prince even kept himself prepared to march with the force of his whole

kingdom to the assistance of Elizabeth. Her authority with the king of

Denmark, and the tie of their common religion, engaged this monarch, upon

her application, to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had bought or

hired in the Danish harbors:[**] the Hanse Towns, though not at that time

on good terms with Elizabeth, were induced, by the same motives, to retard

so long the equipment of some vessels in their ports, that they became

useless to the purpose of invading England. All the Protestants throughout

Europe regarded this enterprise as the critical event which was to decide

forever the fate of their religion; and though unable, by reason of their

distance, to join their force to that of Elizabeth, they kept their eyes

fixed on her conduct and fortune, and beheld with anxiety, mixed with

admiration, the intrepid countenance with which she encountered that

dreadful tempest which was every moment advancing towards her.

 

The queen also was sensible that, next to the general popularity which she

enjoyed, and the confidence which her subjects reposed in her prudent

government, the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general

zeal of the people for the Protestant religion, and the strong prejudices

which they had imbibed against Popery. She took care, on the present

occasion, to revive in the nation this attachment to their own sect, and

this abhorrence of the opposite. The English were reminded of their former

danger from the tyranny of Spain: all the barbarities exercised by Mary

against the Protestants were ascribed to the counsels of that bigoted and

imperious nation: the bloody massacres in the Indies, the unrelenting

executions in the Low Countries, the horrid cruelties and iniquities of

the inquisition, were set before men’s eyes: a list and description was

published, and pictures dispersed, of the several instruments of torture

with which, it was pretended, the Spanish armada was loaded: and every

artifice, as well as reason, was employed, to animate the people to a

vigorous defence of their religion, their laws, and their liberties.

 

But while the queen, in this critical emergence, roused the animosity of

the nation against Popery, she treated the partisans of that sect with

moderation, and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them.

Though she knew that Sixtus Quintus, the present pope, famous for his

capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of excommunication

against her, had deposed her, had absolved her subjects from their oaths

of allegiance, had published a crusade against England, and had granted

plenary indulgences to every one engaged in the present invasion, she

would not believe that all her Catholic subjects could be so blinded as to

sacrifice to bigotry their duty to their sovereign, and the liberty and

independence of their native country. She rejected all violent counsels,

by which she was urged to seek pretences for despatching the leaders of

that party: she would not even confine any considerable number of them:

and the Catholics, sensible of this good usage, generally expressed great

zeal for the public service. Some gentlemen of that sect, conscious that

they could not justly expect any trust or authority, entered themselves as

volunteers in the fleet or army:[*] some equipped ships at their own

charge, and gave the command of them to Protestants: others were active in

animating their tenants, and vassals, and neighbors, to the defence of

their country: and every rank of men, burying for the present all party

distinctions, seemed to prepare themselves, with order as well as vigor,

to resist the violence of these invaders.

 

The more to excite the martial spirit of the nation, the queen appeared on

horseback in the camp at Tilbury; and riding through the lines, discovered

a cheerful and animated countenance, exhorted the soldiers to remember

their duty to their country and their religion, and professed her

intention, though a woman, to lead them herself into the field against the

enemy, and rather to perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of

her people.[*] 28
 

By this spirited behavior she revived the tenderness and admiration of the

soldiery: an attachment to her person became a kind of enthusiasm among

them: and they asked one another, whether it were possible that Englishmen

could abandon this glorious cause, could display less fortitude than

appeared in the female sex, or could ever, by any dangers, be induced to

relinquish the defence of their heroic princess.

 

The Spanish armada was ready in the beginning of May; but the moment it

was preparing to sail, the marquis of Santa Croce, the admiral, was seized

with a fever, of which he soon after died. The vice-admiral, the duke of

Paliano, by a strange concurrence of accidents, at the very same time

suffered the same fate; and the king appointed for admiral the duke of

Medina Sidonia, a nobleman of great family, but unexperienced in action,

and entirely unacquainted with sea affairs. Alcarede was appointed

vice-admiral. This misfortune, besides the loss of so great an officer as

Santa Croce, retarded the sailing of the armada, and gave the English more

time for their preparations to oppose them. At last the Spanish fleet,

full of hopes and alacrity, set sail from Lisbon; but next day met with a

violent tempest, which scattered the ships, sunk some of the smallest, and

forced the rest to take shelter in the Groine, where they waited till they

could be refitted. When news of this event was carried to England, the

queen concluded that the design of an invasion was disappointed for this

summer; and being always ready to lay hold on every pretence for saving

money, she made Walsingham write to the admiral, directing him to lay up

some of the larger ships, and to discharge the seamen: but Lord Effingham,

who was not so sanguine in his hopes, used the freedom to disobey these

orders; and he begged leave to retain all the ships in service, though it

should be at his own expense.[*] He took advantage of a north wind, and

sailed towards the coast of Spain, with an intention of attacking the

enemy in their harbors; but the wind changing to the south, he became

apprehensive lest they might have set sail, and by passing him at sea,

invade England, now exposed by the absence of the fleet. He returned,

therefore, with the utmost expedition to Plymouth, and lay at anchor in

that harbor.

 

Meanwhile all the damages of the armada were repaired; and the Spaniards

with fresh hopes set out again to sea, in prosecution of their enterprise.

The fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels, of which near a

hundred were galleons, and were of greater size than any ever before used

in Europe. It carried on board nineteen thousand two hundred and

ninety-five soldiers, eight thousand four hundred and fifty-six mariners,

two thousand and eighty-eight galley slaves, and two thousand six hundred

and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance. It was victualled for six

months; and was attended by twenty lesser ships, called caravals, and ten

salves with six oars apiece.[**]

 

The plan formed by the king of Spain was, that the armada should sail to

the coast opposite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having chased away all

English or Flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage, (for it was

never supposed they could make opposition,) should join themselves with

the duke of Parma, should thence make sail to the Thames, and having

landed the whole Spanish army, thus complete at one blow the entire

conquest of England. In prosecution of this scheme, Philip gave orders to

the duke of Medina, that in passing along the Channel, he should sail as

near the coast of France as he could with safety; that he should by this

policy avoid meeting with the English fleet; and, keeping in view the main

enterprise, should neglect all smaller successes which might prove an

obstacle, or even interpose a delay, to the acquisition of a kingdom.[***]

 

After the armada was under sail, they took a fisherman, who informed them

that the English admiral had been lately at sea, had heard of the tempest

which scattered the armada, had retired back into Plymouth and no longer

expecting an invasion this season, had laid up his ships, and discharged

most of the seamen. From this false intelligence the duke of Medina

conceived the great facility of attacking and destroying the English ships

in harbor; and he was tempted, by the prospect of so decisive an

advantage, to break his orders, and make sail directly for Plymouth; a

resolution which proved the safety of England. The Lizard was the first

land made by the armada, about sunset; and as the Spaniards took it for

the Ram Head near Plymouth, they bore out to sea with an intention of

returning next day, and attacking the English navy. They were descried by

Fleming, a Scottish pirate, who was roving in those seas, and who

immediately set sail, to inform the English admiral of their approach;[*]

another fortunate event, which contributed extremely to the safety of the

fleet. Effingham had just time to get out of port, when he saw the Spanish

armada coming full sail towards him, disposed in the form of a crescent,

and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one

division to that of the other.

 

The writers of that age raise their style by a pompous description of this

spectacle; the most magnificent that had ever appeared upon the ocean,

infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders. The

lofty masts, the swelling sails, and the towering prows of the Spanish

galleons, seem impossible to be justly painted, but by assuming the colors

of poetry; and an eloquent historian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has

asserted, that the armada, though the ships bore every sail, yet advanced

with a slow motion; as if the ocean groaned with supporting, and the winds

were tired with impelling, so enormous a weight.[**] The truth, however,

is, that the largest of the Spanish vessels would scarcely pass for

third-rates in the present navy of England; yet were they so ill framed,

or so ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not sail upon

a wind, nor tack on occasion, nor be managed in stormy weather by the

seamen. Neither the mechanics of ship-building, nor the experience of

mariners, had attained so great perfection as could serve for the security

and government of such bulky vessels; and the English, who had already had

experience how unserviceable they commonly were, beheld without dismay

their tremendous appearance.

 

Effingham gave orders not to come to close fight with the Spaniards; where

the size of the ships, he suspected, and the numbers of the soldiers,

would be a disadvantage to the English; but to cannonade them at a

distance, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or various

accidents must afford him of intercepting some scattered vessels of the

enemy. Nor was it long before the event answered expectation A great ship

of Biscay, on board of which was a considerable part of the Spanish money,

took fire by accident; and while all hands were employed in extinguishing

the flames, she fell behind the rest of the armada: the great galleon of

Andalusia was detained by the springing of her mast: and both these

vessels were taken, after some resistance, by Sir Francis Drake. As the

armada advanced up the Channel, the English hung upon its rear, and still

infested it with skirmishes. Each trial abated the confidence of the

Spaniards, and added courage to the English; and the latter soon found,

that even in close fight the size of the Spanish ships was no advantage to

them. Their bulk exposed them the more to the fire of the enemy; while

their cannon, placed too high, shot over the heads of the English. The

alarm having now reached, the coast of England, the nobility and gentry

hastened out, with their vessels from every harbor, and reÃ«nforced the

admiral. The earls of Oxford, Northumberland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas

Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavasor, Sir

Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount, with many others, distinguished

themselves by this generous and disinterested service of their country.

The English fleet, after the conjunction of those ships, amounted to a

hundred and forty sail.

 

The armada had now reached Calais, and cast anchor before that place, in

expectation that the duke of Parma, who had gotten intelligence of their

approach, would put to sea and join his forces to them. The English

admiral practised here a successful stratagem upon the Spaniards. He took

eight of his smaller ships, and filling them with all combustible

materials, sent them, one after another, into the midst of the enemy. The

Spaniards fancied that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a

famous vessel which had lately done so much execution in the Schelde near

Antwerp; and they immediately cut their cables, and took to flight with

the greatest disorder and precipitation. The English fell upon them next

morning while in confusion; and besides doing great damage to other ships,

they took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy.

 

By this time, it was become apparent, that the intention for which these

preparations were made by the Spaniards was entirely frustrated. The

vessels provided by the duke of Parma were made for transporting soldiers,

not for fighting; and that general, when urged to leave the harbor,

positively refused to expose his flourishing army to such apparent hazard;

while the English not only were able to keep the sea, but seemed even to

triumph over their enemy. The Spanish admiral found, in many rencounters,

that while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy, he had

destroyed only one small vessel of the English; and he foresaw, that by

continuing so unequal a combat, he must draw inevitable destruction on all

the remainder. He prepared, therefore, to return homewards; but as the

wind was contrary to his passage through the Channel, he resolved to sail

northwards, and making the tour of the island, reach the Spanish harbors

by the ocean. The English fleet followed him during some time; and had not

their ammunition fallen short, by the negligence of the offices in

supplying them, they had obliged the whole armada to surrender at

discretion. The duke of Medina had once taken that resolution, but was

diverted from it by the advice of his confessor. This conclusion of the

enterprise would have been more glorious to the English; but the event

proved almost equally fatal to the Spaniards. A violent tempest overtook

the armada after it passed the Orkneys; the ships had already lost their

anchors, and were obliged to keep to sea: the mariners, unaccustomed to

such hardships, and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels, yielded to

the fury of the storm, and allowed their ships to drive either on the

western isles of Scotland, or on the coast of Ireland, where they were

miserably wrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and the

seamen as well as soldiers who remained, were so overcome with hardships

and fatigue, and so dispirited by their discomfiture, that they filled all

Spain with accounts of the desperate valor of the English and of the

tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them.

 

Such was the miserable and dishonorable conclusion of an enterprise which

had been preparing for three years, which had exhausted the revenue and

force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety or

expectation. Philip, who was a slave to his ambition, but had an entire

command over his countenance, no sooner heard of the mortifying event

which blasted all his hopes, than he fell on his knees, and rendering

thanks for that gracious dispensation of Providence expressed his joy that

the calamity was not greater. The Spanish priests, who had so often

blessed this holy crusade and foretold its infallible success, were

somewhat at a loss to account for the victory gained over the Catholic

monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable usurper: but they at

last discovered, that all the calamities of the Spaniards had proceeded

from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among them.[*] 29
 

1589.

 

Soon after the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish armada, the queen

summoned a new parliament, and received from them a supply of two

subsidies and four fifteenths, payable in four years. This is the first

instance that subsidies were doubled in one supply; and so unusual a

concession was probably obtained from the joy of the present success, and

from the general sense of the queen’s necessities. Some members objected

to this heavy charge, on account of the great burden of loans which had

lately been imposed upon the nation.[**] 30
 

Elizabeth foresaw that this house of commons, like all the foregoing,

would be governed by the Puritans; and therefore, to obviate their

enterprises, she renewed, at the beginning of the session, her usual

injunction, that the parliament should not on any account presume to treat

of matters ecclesiastical. Notwithstanding this strict inhibition, the

zeal of one Damport moved him to present a bill to the commons for

remedying spiritual grievances, and for restraining the tyranny of the

ecclesiastical commission, which were certainly great: but when Mr.

Secretary Woley reminded the house of her majesty’s commands, no one durst

second the motion; the bill was not so much as read; and the speaker

returned it to Damport without taking the least notice of it.[***] Some

members of the house, notwithstanding the general submission were even

committed to custody on account of this attempt.[****]

 

The imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still more clearly in another

parliamentary transaction. The right of purveyance was an ancient

prerogative, by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take

provisions for the household from all the neighboring counties, and could

make use of the carts and carriages of the farmers; and the price of these

commodities and services was fixed and stated. The payment of the money

was often distant and uncertain; and the rates, being fixed before the

discovery of the West Indies, were much inferior to the present market

price; so that purveyance, besides the slavery of it, was always regarded

as a great burden, and being arbitrary and casual, was liable to great

abuses. We may fairly presume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth,

supported by her unlimited power, would be sure to render this prerogative

very oppressive to the people; and the commons had, last session, found it

necessary to pass a bill for regulating these exactions: but the bill was

lost in the house of peers.[*] The continuance of the abuses begat a new

attempt for redress; and the same bill was now revived, and again sent up

to the house of peers, together with a bill for some new regulations in

the court of exchequer. Soon after, the commons received a message from

the upper house, desiring them to appoint a committee for a conference. At

this conference, the peers informed them, that the queen, by a message

delivered by Lord Burleigh, had expressed her displeasure that the commons

should presume to touch on her prerogative. If there were any abuses, she

said, either in imposing purveyance, or in the practice of the court of

exchequer, her majesty was both able and willing to provide due

reformation; but would not permit the parliament to intermeddle in these

matters.[**]

 

The commons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed another committee to

attend the queen, and endeavor to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful

intentions. Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee: she

expressed her great “inestimable loving care” towards her loving subjects;

which, she said, was greater than of her own self, or even than any of

them could have of themselves. She told them, that she had already given

orders for an inquiry into the abuses attending purveyance, but the

dangers of the Spanish invasion had retarded the progress of the design;

that she had as much skill, will, and power to rule her household as any

subjects whatsoever to govern theirs, and needed as little the assistance

of her neighbors; that the exchequer was her chamber, consequently more

near to her than even her house’ bold, and therefore the less proper for

them to intermeddle with; and that she would of herself, with advice of

her council and the judges, redress every grievance in these matters, but

would not permit the commons, by laws moved without her privity, to

bereave her of the honor attending these regulations.[*] The issue of this

matter was the same that attended all contests between Elizabeth and her

parliaments.[**] She seems even to have been more imperious, in this

particular, than her predecessors; at least her more remote ones: for they

often permitted the abuses of purveyance[***] 31to be redressed by

law.[****] Edward III., a very arbitrary prince, allowed ten several

statutes to be enacted for that purpose.

 

In so great awe did the commons stand of every courtier, as well as of the

crown, that they durst use no freedom of speech which they thought would

give the least offence to any of them. Sir Edward Hobby showed in the

house his extreme grief, that by some great personage, not a member of the

house, he had been sharply rebuked for speeches delivered in parliament:

he craved the favor of the house, and desired that some of the members

might inform that great personage of his true meaning and intention in

these speeches.[*] The commons, to obviate these inconveniencies, passed a

vote that no one should reveal the secrets of the house.[**]

 

The discomfiture of the armada had begotten in the nation a kind of

enthusiastic passion for enterprises against Spain; and nothing seemed now

impossible to be achieved by the valor and fortune of the English. Don

Antonio, prior of Crato, a natural son of the royal family of Portugal,

trusting to the aversion of his countrymen against the Castilians, had

advanced a claim to the crown; and flying first to France, thence to

England, had been encouraged both by Henry and Elizabeth in his

pretensions. A design was formed by the people, not the court of England,

to conquer the kingdom for Don Antonio: Sir Francis Drake and Sir John

Norris were the leaders in this romantic enterprise: near twenty thousand

volunteers[*] enlisted themselves in the service: and ships were hired, as

well as arms provided, at the charge of the adventurers. The queen’s

frugality kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand pounds to

the expense; and she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the

expedition.[**] There was more spirit and bravery than foresight or

prudence in the conduct of this enterprise. The small stock of the

adventurers did not enable them to buy either provisions or ammunition

sufficient for such an undertaking; they even wanted vessels to stow the

numerous volunteers who crowded to them; and they were obliged to seize by

force some ships of the Hanse Towns, which they met with at sea; an

expedient which set them somewhat at ease in point of room for their men,

but remedied not the deficiency of their provisions.[***]

 

Had they sailed directly to Portugal, it is believed that the good will of

the people, joined to the defenceless state of the country, might have

insured them of success: but hearing that great preparations were making

at the Groine for the invasion of England, they were induced to go

thither, and destroy this new armament of Spain. They broke into the

harbor; burned some ships of war, particularly one commanded by Recalde,

vice-admiral of Spain; they defeated an army of four or five thousand men,

which was assembled to oppose them; they assaulted the Groine, and took

the lower town, which they pillaged; and they would have taken the higher,

though well fortified, had they not found their ammunition and provisions

beginning to fail them. The young earl of Essex, a nobleman of promising

hopes, who, fired with the thirst of military honor, had secretly, unknown

to the queen, stolen from England, here joined the adventurers; and it was

then agreed by common consent to make sail for Portugal, the main object

of their enterprise.

 

The English landed at Paniche, a seaport town twelve leagues from Lisbon,

and Norris led the army to that capital, while Drake undertook to sail up

the river, and attack the city with united forces. By this time, the court

of Spain had gotten leisure to prepare against the invasion. Forces were

thrown into Lisbon: the Portuguese were disarmed: all suspected persons

were taken into custody: and thus, though the inhabitants bore great

affection to Don Antonio, none of them durst declare in favor of the

invaders. The English army, however, made themselves masters of the

suburbs, which abounded with riches of all kinds; but as they desired to

conciliate the affections of the Portuguese, and were more intent on honor

than profit, they observed a strict discipline, and abstained from all

plunder. Meanwhile they found their ammunition and provisions much

exhausted; they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the walls; the

admiral had not been able to pass some fortresses which guarded the river;

there was no appearance of an insurrection in their favor; sickness, from

fatigue, hunger, and intemperance in wine and fruits, had seized the army;

so that it was found necessary to make all possible haste to reÃ«mbark.

They were not pursued by the enemy, and finding at the mouth of the river

sixty ships laden with naval stores, they seized them as lawful prize;

though they belonged to the Hanse Towns, a neutral power. They sailed

thence to Vigo, which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country

around, they set sail and arrived in England. Above half of these gallant

adventurers perished by sickness, famine, fatigue, and the sword;[*] and

England reaped more honor than profit from this extraordinary enterprise.

It is computed, that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked on board the fleet,

and that only three hundred and fifty survived those multiplied

disasters.[**]

 

When these ships were on their voyage homewards, they met with the earl of

Cumberland, who was outward bound, with a fleet of seven sail, all

equipped at his own charge, except one ship of war which the queen had

lent him. That nobleman supplied Sir Francis Drake with some provisions; a

generosity which saved the lives of many of Drake’s men, but for which the

others afterwards suffered severely. Cumberland sailed towards the

Terceras, and took several prizes from the enemy; but the richest, valued

at a hundred thousand pounds, perished in her return, with all her cargo,

near St. Michael’s Mount, in Cornwall. Many of these adventurers were

killed in a rash attempt at the Terceras: a great mortality seized the

rest; and it was with difficulty that the few hands which remained were

able to steer the ships back into harbor.[*]

 

Though the signal advantages gained over the Spaniards, and the spirit

thence infused into the English, gave Elizabeth great security during the

rest of her reign, she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye on

Scotland, whose situation rendered its revolutions always of importance to

her. It might have been expected that this high-spirited princess, who

knew so well to brave danger, would not have retained that malignant

jealousy towards her heir, with which, during the lifetime of Mary, she

had been so much agitated. James had indeed succeeded to all the claims of

his mother; but he had not succeeded to the favor of the Catholics, which

could alone render these claims dangerous:[**] and as the queen was now

well advanced in years, and enjoyed an uncontrolled authority over her

subjects, it was not likely that the king of Scots, who was of an

indolent, unambitious temper, would ever give her any disturbance in her

possession of the throne. Yet all these circumstances could not remove her

timorous suspicions; and so far from satisfying the nation by a settlement

of the succession, or a declaration of James’s title, she was as anxious

to prevent every incident which might anywise raise his credit, or procure

him the regard of the English, as if he had been her immediate rival and

competitor. Most of his ministers and favorites were her pensioners; and

as she was desirous to hinder him from marrying and having children, she

obliged them to throw obstacles in the way of every alliance, even the

most reasonable which could be offered him; and during some years she

succeeded in this malignant policy.[***]

 

He had fixed on the elder daughter of the king of Denmark, who, being a

remote prince and not powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did she so

artfully cross this negotiation, that the Danish monarch, impatient of

delay, married his daughter to the duke of Brunswick. James then renewed

his suit to the younger princess, and still found obstacles from the

intrigues of Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of interposing delay,

proposed to him the sister of the king of Navarre, a princess much older

than himself, and entirely destitute of fortune. The young king, besides

the desire of securing himself, by the prospect of issue, from those

traitorous attempts too frequent among his subjects had been so watched by

the rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, that he had another inducement

to marry, which is not so usual with monarchs. His impatience, therefore,

broke through all the politics of Elizabeth: the articles of marriage were

settled; the ceremony was performed by proxy; and the princess embarked

for Scotland; but was driven by a storm into a port of Norway. This

tempest, and some others which happened near the same time, were

universally believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded from a

combination of the Scottish and Danish witches; and the dying confession

of the criminals was supposed to put the accusation beyond all

controversy.[*] James, however, though a great believer in sorcery, was

not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage in order to conduct his

bride home: he arrived in Norway; carried the queen thence to Copenhagen:

and having passed the winter in that city, he brought her next spring to

Scotland, where they were joyfully received by the people. The clergy

alone, who never neglected an opportunity of vexing their prince, made

opposition to the queen’s coronation, on account of the ceremony of

anointing her, which, they alleged, was either a Jewish or a Popish rite,

and therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful. But James was as much

bent on the ceremony as they were averse to it: and after much controversy

and many intrigues, his authority, which had not often happened, at last

prevailed over their opposition.[**]
