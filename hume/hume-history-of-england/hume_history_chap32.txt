THE rough hand of Henry seemed well adapted for rending asunder those

bands by which the ancient superstition had fastened itself on the

kingdom; and though, after renouncing the pope’s supremacy and suppressing

monasteries, most of the political ends of reformation were already

attained, few people expected that he would stop at those innovations. The

spirit of opposition, it was thought, would carry him to the utmost

extremities against the church of Rome; and lead him to declare war

against the whole doctrine and worship, as well as discipline, of that

mighty hierarchy. He had formerly appealed from the pope to a general

council; but now, when a general council was summoned to meet at Mantua,

he previously renounced all submission to it, as summoned by the pope, and

lying entirely under subjection to that spiritual usurper. He engaged his

clergy to make a declaration to the like purpose; and he had prescribed to

them many other deviations from ancient tenets and practices. Cranmner

took advantage of every opportunity to carry him on in this course; and

while Queen Jane lived, who favored the reformers, he had, by means of her

insinuation and address, been successful in his endeavors. After her

death, Gardiner, who was returned from his embassy to France, kept the

king more in suspense; and by feigning an unlimited submission to his

will, was frequently able to guide him to his own purposes. Fox, bishop of

Hereford, had supported Cranmer in his schemes for a more thorough

reformation; but his death had made way for the promotion of Bonner, who,

though he had hitherto seemed a furious enemy to the court of Rome, was

determined to sacrifice every thing to present interest, and had joined

the confederacy of Gardiner and the partisans of the old religion.

Gardiner himself, it was believed, had secretly entered into measures with

the pope, and even with the emperor; and in concert with these powers, he

endeavored to preserve, as much as possible, the ancient faith and

worship.

 

Henry was so much governed by passion, that nothing could have retarded

his animosity and opposition against Rome, but some other passion, which

stopped his career, and raised him new objects of animosity. Though he had

gradually, since the commencement of his scruples with regard to his first

marriage, been changing the tenets of that theological system in which he

had been educated, he was no less positive and dogmatical in the few

articles which remained to him, than if the whole fabric had continued

entire and unshaken. And though he stood alone in his opinion, the

flattery of courtiers had so inflamed his tyrannical arrogance, that he

thought himself entitled to regulate, by his own particular standard, the

religious faith of the whole nation. The point on which he chiefly rested

his orthodoxy happened to be the real presence; that very doctrine, in

which, among the numberless victories of superstition over common sense,

her triumph is the most signal and egregious. All departure from this

principle he held to be heretical and detestable; and nothing, he thought,

would be more honorable for him, than, while he broke off all connections

with the Roman pontiff, to maintain, in this essential article, the purity

of the Catholic faith.

 

There was one Lambert,[*] a schoolmaster in London, who had been

questioned and confined for unsound opinions by Archbishop Warham; but

upon the death of that prelate, and the change of counsels at court, he

had been released. Not terrified with the danger which he had incurred, he

still continued to promulgate his tenets; and having heard Dr. Taylor

afterwards bishop of Lincoln, defend in a sermon the corporal presence, he

could not forbear expressing to Taylor his dissent from that doctrine; and

he drew up his objections under ten several heads. Taylor communicated the

paper to Dr. Barnes, who happened to be a Lutheran, and who maintained

that though the substance of bread and wine remained, in the sacrament,

yet the real body and blood of Christ were there also, and were, in a

certain mysterious manner, incorporated with the material elements.

 

By the present laws and practice Barnes was no less exposed to the stake

than Lambert; yet such was the persecuting rage which prevailed, that he

determined to bring this man to condign punishment; because of their

common departure from the ancient faith, he had dared to go one step

farther than himself. He engaged Taylor to accuse Lambert before Cranmer

and Latimer, who, whatever their private opinion might be on these points,

were obliged to conform themselves to the standard of orthodoxy

established by Henry. When Lambert was cited before these prelates, they

endeavored to bend him to a recantation; and they were surprised when,

instead of complying, he ventured to appeal to the king.

 

The king, not displeased with an opportunity where he could at once exert

his supremacy and display his learning, accepted the appeal; and resolved

to mix, in a very unfair manner, the magistrate with the disputant. Public

notice was given that he intended to enter the lists with the

schoolmaster: scaffolds were erected in Westminster Hall, for the

accommodation of the audience: Henry appeared on his throne accompanied

with all the ensigns of majesty: the prelates were placed on his right

hand: the temporal peers on his left. The judges and most eminent lawyers

had a place assigned them behind the bishops; the courtiers of greatest

distinction behind the peers; and in the midst of this splendid assembly

was produced the unhappy Lambert, who was required to defend his opinions

against his royal antagonist.[*]

 

The bishop of Chichester opened the conference, by saying, that Lambert,

being charged with heretical pravity, had appealed from his bishop to the

king; as if he expected more favor from this application, and as if the

king could ever be induced to protect a heretic: that though his majesty

had thrown off the usurpations of the see of Rome; had disincorporated

some idle monks, who lived like drones in a beehive, had abolished the

idolatrous worship of images; had published the Bible in English, for the

instruction of all his subjects; and had made some lesser alterations,

which every one must approve of; yet was he determined to maintain the

purity of the Catholic faith, and to punish with the utmost severity all

departure from it; and that he had taken the present opportunity, before

so learned and grave an audience, of convincing Lambert of his errors; but

if he still continued obstinate in them, he must expect the most condign

punishment,[**]

 

After this preamble, which was not very encouraging, the king asked

Lambert, with a stern countenance, what his opinion was of Christ’s

corporal presence in the sacrament of the altar; and when Lambert began

his reply with some compliment to his majesty, he rejected the praise with

disdain and indignation. He afterwards pressed Lambert with arguments

drawn from Scripture and the schoolmen: the audience applauded the force

of his reasoning, and the extent of his erudition: Cranmer seconded his

proofs by some new topics. Gardiner entered the lists as a support to

Cranmner: Tonstal took up the argument after Gardiner: Stokesley brought

fresh aid to Tonstal; six bishops more appeared successively in the field

after Stokesley. And the disputation, if it deserve the name, was

prolonged for five hours; till Lambert, fatigued, confounded, browbeaten,

and abashed, was at last reduced to silence. The king, then returning to

the charge, asked him whether he were convinced; and he proposed, as a

concluding argument, this interesting question: Whether he were resolved

to live or to die? Lambert, who possessed that courage which consists in

obstinacy, replied, that he cast himself wholly on his majesty’s clemency:

the king told him that he would be no protector of heretics; and,

therefore, if that were his final answer, he must expect to be committed

to the flames Cromwell, as vicegerent, pronounced the sentence against

him.[*] 14
 

Lambert, whose vanity had probably incited him the more to persevere on

account of the greatness of this public appearance, was not daunted by the

terrors of the punishment to which he was condemned. His executioners took

care to make the sufferings of a man who had personally opposed the king

as cruel as possible: he was burned at a slow fire; his legs and thighs

were consumed to the stumps; and when there appeared no end of his

torments, some of the guards, more merciful than the rest, lifted him on

their halberts and threw him into the flames, where he was consumed. While

they were employed in this friendly office, he cried aloud several times,

“None but Christ, none but Christ!” and these words were in his mouth when

he expired.[**]

 

Some few days before this execution, four Dutch Anabaptists, three men and

a woman, had fagots tied to their backs at Paul’s Cross, and were burned

in that manner. Andaman and a woman of the same sect and country were

burned in Smithfield.[***]

 

1539.

 

It was the unhappy fate of the English during this age, that, when they

labored under any grievance, they had not the satisfaction of expecting

redress from parliament on the contrary, they had reason to dread each

meeting of that assembly, and were then sure of having tyranny converted

into law, and aggravated, perhaps, with some circumstance which the

arbitrary prince and his ministers had not hitherto devised, or did not

think proper of themselves to carry into execution. This abject servility

never appeared more conspicuously than in a new parliament which the king

now assembled, and which, if he had been so pleased, might have been the

last that ever sat in England. But he found them too useful instruments of

dominion ever to entertain thoughts of giving them a total exclusion.

 

The chancellor opened the parliament by informing the house of lords, that

it was his majesty’s earnest desire to extirpate from his kingdom all

diversity of opinion in matters of religion; and as this undertaking was,

he owned, important and arduous, he desired them to choose a committee

from among themselves, who might draw up certain articles of faith; and

communicate them afterwards to the parliament. The lords named the

vicar-general, Cromwell, now created peer, the archbishops of Canterbury

and York, the bishops of Durham, Carlisle, Worcester, Bath and Wells,

Bangor, and Ely. The house might have seen what a hopeful task they had

undertaken: this small committee itself was agitated with such diversity

of opinion, that it could come to no conclusion. The duke of Norfolk then

moved in the house, that, since there were no hopes of having a report

from the committee, the articles of faith intended to be established

should be reduced to six; and a new committee be appointed to draw an act

with regard to them. As this peer was understood to speak the sense of the

king, his motion was immediately complied with; and, after a short

prorogation, the bill of the “six articles,” or the bloody bill, as the

Protestants justly termed it, was introduced, and having passed the two

houses, received the royal assent.

 

In this law the doctrine of the real presence was established, the

communion in one kind, the perpetual obligation of vows of chastity, the

utility of private masses, the celibacy of the clergy, and the necessity

of auricular confession. The denial of the first article, with regard to

the real presence, subjected the person to death by fire, and to the same

forfeiture as in cases of treason; and admitted not the privilege of

abjuring: an unheard-of severity, and unknown to the inquisition itself

The denial of any of the other five articles, even though recanted, was

punishable by the forfeiture of goods and chattels, and imprisonment

during the king’s pleasure: an obstinate adherence to error, or a relapse,

was adjudged to be felony, and punishable with death. The marriage of

priests was subjected to the same punishment. Their commerce with women

was, on the first offence, forfeiture and imprisonment; on the second,

death. The abstaining from confession, and from receiving the eucharist at

the accustomed times, subjected the person to fine, and to imprisonment

during the king’s pleasure; and if the criminal persevered after

conviction, he was punishable by death and forfeiture, as in cases of

felony.[*] Commissioners were to be appointed by the king for inquiring

into these heresies and irregular practices; and the criminals were to be

tried by a jury.

 

The king in framing this law laid his oppressive hand on both parties; and

even the Catholics had reason to complain, that the friars and nuns,

though dismissed their convent, should be capriciously restrained to the

practice of celibacy:[**] 15 but as the Protestants were chiefly exposed to

the severity of the statute, the misery of adversaries, according to the

usual maxims of party, was regarded by the adherents to the ancient

religion as their own prosperity and triumph. Cranmer had the courage to

oppose this bill in the house; and though the king desired him to absent

himself, he could not be prevailed on to give this proof of

compliance.[***] Henry was accustomed to Cranmer’s freedom and sincerity;

and being convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions, gave him

an unusual indulgence in this particular, and never allowed even a whisper

against him. That prelate, however, was now obliged, in obedience to the

statute, to dismiss his wife, the niece of Osiander, a famous divine of

Nuremburg,[****] and Henry, satisfied with this proof of submission,

showed him his former countenance and favor. Latimer and Shaxton threw up

their bishoprics on account of the law, and were committed to prison.

 

The parliament, having thus resigned all their religious liberties,

proceeded to an entire surrender of their civil; and without scruple or

deliberation they made, by one act, a total subversion of the English

constitution. They gave to the king’s proclamation the same force as to a

statute enacted by parliament; and to render the matter worse, if

possible, they framed this law, as if it were only declaratory, and were

intended to explain the natural extent of royal authority. The preamble

contains, that the king had formerly set forth several proclamations which

froward persons had wilfully contemned, not considering what a king, by

his royal power, may do; that this license might encourage offenders not

only to disobey the laws of Almighty God, but also to dishonor the king’s

most royal majesty, “who may full ill bear it;” that sudden emergencies

often occur, which require speedy remedies, and cannot await the slow

assembling and deliberations of parliament; and that, though the king was

empowered by his authority, derived from God, to consult the public good

on these occasions, yet the opposition of refractory subjects might push

him to extremity and violence: for these reasons the parliament, that they

might remove all occasion of doubt, ascertained by a statute this

prerogative of the crown and enabled his majesty, with the advice of his

council, to set forth proclamations enjoining obedience under whatever

pains and penalties he should think proper; and these proclamations were

to have the force of perpetual laws.[*]

 

What proves either a stupid or a wilful blindness in the parliament, is,

that they pretended, even after this statute, to maintain some limitations

in the government; and they enacted, that no proclamation should deprive

any person of his lawful possessions, liberties, inheritances, privileges,

franchises; nor yet infringe any common law or laudable custom of the

realm. They did not consider, that no penalty could be inflicted on the

disobeying of proclamations, without invading some liberty or property of

the subject; and that the power of enacting new laws, joined to the

dispensing power then exercised by the crown, amounted to a full

legislative authority. It is true, the kings of England had always been

accustomed from their own authority to issue proclamations, and to exact

obedience to them; and this prerogative was, no doubt, a strong symptom of

absolute government: but still there was a difference between a power

which was exercised on a particular emergence, and which must be justified

by the present expedience or necessity, and an authority conferred by a

positive statute, which could no longer admit of control or limitation.

 

Could any act be more opposite to the spirit of liberty than this law, it

would have been another of the same parliament. They passed an act of

attainder, not only against the marquis of Exeter, the lords Montacute,

Darcy, Hussey, and others, who had been legally tried and condemned, but

also against some persons of the highest quality, who had never been

accused, or examined, or convicted. The violent hatred which Henry bore to

Cardinal Pole had extended itself to all his friends and relations; and

his mother in particular, the countess of Salisbury, had on that account

become extremely obnoxious to him. She was also accused of having employed

her authority with her tenants, to hinder them from reading the new

translation of the Bible; of having procured bulls from Rome, which, it is

said, had been seen at Coudray, her country seat; and of having kept a

correspondence with her son, the cardinal; but Henry found, either that

these offences could not be proved, or that they would not by law be

subjected to such severe punishments as he desired to inflict upon her. He

resolved, therefore, to proceed in a more summary and more tyrannical

manner; and for that purpose he sent Cromwell, who was but too obsequious

to his will, to ask the judges, whether the parliament could attaint a

person who was forthcoming, without giving him any trial, or citing him to

appear before them?[*] The judges replied, that it was a dangerous

question; and that the high court of parliament ought to give the example

to inferior courts, of proceeding according to justice; no inferior court

could act in that arbitrary manner, and they thought that the parliament

never would. Being pressed to give a more explicit answer, they replied,

that if a person were attainted in that manner, the attainder could never

afterwards be brought in question, but must remain good in law. Henry

learned by this decision, that such a method of proceeding, though

directly contrary to all the principles of equity, was yet practicable;

and this being all he was anxious to know, he resolved to employ it

against the countess of Salisbury.

 

Cromwell showed to the house of peers a banner, on which were embroidered

the five wounds of Christ, the symbol chosen by the northern rebels; and

this banner he affirmed, was found in the countess’s house.[*] No other

proof seems to have been produced in order to ascertain her guilt: the

parliament, without further inquiry, passed a bill of attainder against

her; and they involved in the same bill, without any better proof, as far

as appears, Gertrude marchioness of Exeter, Sir Adrian Fortescue, and Sir

Thomas Dingley. These two gentlemen were executed; the marchioness was

pardoned and survived the king; the countess received a reprieve.

 

The only beneficial act passed this session, was that by which the

parliament confirmed the surrender of the monasteries; yet even this act

contains much falsehood, much tyranny, and, were it not that all private

rights must submit to public interest, much injustice and iniquity. The

scheme of engaging the abbots to surrender their monasteries had been

conducted, as may easily be imagined, with many invidious circumstances:

arts of all kinds had been employed; every motive that could work on the

frailty of human nature had been set before them; and it was with great

difficulty that these dignified conventuals were brought to make a

concession, which most of them regarded as destructive of their interests,

as well as sacrilegious and criminal in itself.[**] Three abbots had shown

more constancy than the rest, the abbots of Colchester, Reading, and

Glastenbury; and in order to punish them for their opposition, and make

them an example to others, means had been found to convict them of

treason, they had perished by the hands of the executioner, and the

revenue of the convents had been forfeited.[***] Besides, though none of

these violences had taken place, the king knew that a surrender made by

men who were only tenants for life, would not bear examination; and he was

therefore resolved to make all sure by his usual expedient, an act of

parliament. In the preamble to this act, the parliament asserts, that all

the surrenders made by the abbots had been “without constraint, of their

own accord, and according to due course of common law.” And in

consequence, the two houses confirm the surrenders, and secure the

property of the abbey lands to the king and his successors forever.[****]

It is remarkable, that all the mitred abbots still sat in the house of

peers, and that none of them made any protests against this injurious

statute.

 

In this session, the rank of all the great officers of state was fixed:

Cromwell, as vicegerent, had the precedency assigned him above all of

them. It was thought singular, that a blacksmith’s son, for he was no

other, should have place next the royal family; and that a man possessed

of no manner of literature should be set at the head of the church.

 

As soon as the act of the six articles had passed, the Catholics were

extremely vigilant in informing against offenders; and no less than five

hundred persons were in a little time thrown into prison. But Cromwell,

who had not had interest enough to prevent that act, was able for the

present to elude its execution. Seconded by the duke of Suffolk and

Chancellor Audley, as well as by Cranmer, he remonstrated against the

cruelty of punishing so many delinquents; and he obtained permission to

set them at liberty. The uncertainty of the king’s humor gave each party

an opportunity of triumphing in its turn. No sooner had Henry passed this

law, which seemed to inflict so deep a wound on the reformers, than he

granted a general permission for every one to have the new translation of

the Bible in his family; a concession regarded by that party as an

important victory.

 

But as Henry was observed to be much governed by his wives while he

retained his fondness for them, the final prevalence of either party

seemed much to depend on the choice of the future queen. Immediately after

the death of Jane Seymour, the most beloved of all his wives, he began to

think of a new marriage. He first cast his eye towards the duchess dowager

of Milan, niece to the emperor; and he made proposals for that alliance.

But meeting with difficulties, he was carried by his friendship for

Francis rather to think of a French princess. He demanded the duchess

dowager of Longueville, daughter of the duke of Guise, a prince of the

house of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that the lady was already

betrothed to the king of Scotland. The king, however, would not take a

refusal: he had set his heart extremely on the match: the information

which he had received of the duchess’s accomplishments and beauty, had

prepossessed him in her favor; and having privately sent over Meautys to

examine her person, and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the

accounts which that agent brought him served further to inflame his

desires. He learned that she was big made; and he thought her on that

account the more proper match for him who was now become somewhat

corpulent. The pleasure, too, of mortifying his nephew, whom he did not

love, was a further incitement to his prosecution of this match; and he

insisted that Francis should give him the preference to the king of Scots.

But Francis, though sensible that the alliance of England was of much

greater importance to his interests, would not affront his friend and

ally; and to prevent further solicitation, he immediately sent the

princess to Scotland. Not to shock, however, Henry’s humor, Francis made

him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the duke of VendÃ´me; but as

the king was informed that James had formerly rejected this princess he

would not hear any further of such a proposal. The French monarch then

offered him the choice of the two younger sisters of the queen of Scots;

and he assured him, that they were nowise inferior either in merit or size

to their elder sister, and that one of them was even superior in beauty.

The king was as scrupulous with regard to the person of his wives, as if

his heart had been really susceptible of a delicate passion; and he was

unwilling to trust any relations, or even pictures, with regard to this

important particular. He proposed to Francis, that they should have a

conference at Calais on pretence of business; and that this monarch should

bring along with him the two princesses of Guise, together with the finest

ladies of quality in France, that he might make a choice among them. But

the gallant spirit of Francis was shocked with the proposal: he was

impressed with too much regard, he said, for the fair sex, to carry ladies

of the first quality like geldings to a market, there to be chosen or

rejected by the humor of the purchaser.[*] Henry would hearken to none of

these niceties, but still insisted on his proposal; which, however,

notwithstanding Francis’s earnest desire of obliging him, was finally

rejected.

 

The king then began to turn his thoughts towards a German alliance; and as

the princes of the Smalcaldic league were extremely disgusted with the

emperor on account of his persecuting their religion, he hoped, by

matching himself into one of their families, to renew a connection which

he regarded as so advantageous to him. Cromwell joyfully seconded this

intention; and proposed to him Anne of Cleves, whose father, the duke of

that name, had great interest among the Lutheran princes, and whose

sister, Sibylla, was married to the elector of Saxony, the head of the

Protestant league. A flattering picture of the princess, by Hans Holben,

determined Henry to apply to her father; and after some negotiation, the

marriage, notwithstanding the opposition of the elector of Saxony was at

last concluded; and Anne was sent over to England. The king, impatient to

be satisfied with regard to the person of his bride, came privately to

Rochester and got a sight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall as he

could wish; but utterly destitute both of beauty and grace; very unlike

the pictures and representations which he had received: he swore she was a

great Flanders mare; and declared that he never could possibly bear her

any affection. The matter was worse when he found that she could speak no

language but Dutch, of which he was entirely ignorant; and that the charms

of her conversation were not likely to compensate for the homeliness of

her person. He returned to Greenwich very melancholy; and he much lamented

his hard fate to Cromwell, as well as to Lord Russel, Sir Anthony Brown,

and Sir Anthony Denny. This last gentleman, in order to give him comfort,

told him, that his misfortune was common to him with all kings, who could

not, like private persons, choose for themselves, but must receive their

wives from the judgment and fancy of others.

 

It was the subject of debate among the king’s counsellors, whether the

marriage could not yet be dissolved, and the princess be sent back to her

own country. Henry’s situation seemed at that time very critical. After

the ten years’ truce concluded between the emperor and the king of France,

a good understanding was thought to have taken place between these rival

monarchs; and such marks of union appeared, as gave great jealousy to the

court of England. The emperor, who knew the generous nature of Francis,

even put a confidence in him which is rare to that degree among great

princes. An insurrection had been raised in the Low Countries by the

inhabitants of Ghent, and seemed to threaten the most dangerous

consequences. Charles, who resided at that time in Spain, resolved to go

in person to Flanders, in order to appease those disorders; but he found

great difficulties in choosing the manner of his passing thither. The road

by Italy and Germany was tedious: the voyage through the channel

dangerous, by reason of the English naval power: he asked Francis’s

permission to pass through his dominions; and he entrusted himself into

the hands of a rival, whom he had so mortally offended. The French monarch

received him at Paris with great magnificence and courtesy; and though

prompted both by revenge and interest, as well as by the advice of his

mistress and favorites, to make advantage of the present opportunity, he

conducted the emperor safely out of his dominions and would not so much as

speak to him of business during his abode in France, lest his demands

should bear the air of violence upon his royal guest.

 

Henry, who was informed of all these particulars, believed that an entire

and cordial union had taken place between these princes; and that their

religious zeal might prompt them to fall with combined arms upon

England.[*] An alliance with the German princes seemed now more than ever

requisite for his interest and safety; and he knew that if he sent back

the princess of Cleves, such an affront would be highly resented by her

friends and family.

 

1540.

 

He was therefore resolved, notwithstanding his aversion to her, to

complete the marriage; and he told Cromwell, that, since matters had gone

so far, he must put his neck into the yoke. Cromwell, who knew how much

his own interests were concerned in this affair, was very anxious to learn

from the king, next morning after the marriage, whether he now liked his

spouse any better. The king told him, that he hated her worse than ever;

and that her person was more disgusting on a near approach; he was

resolved never to meddle with her: and even suspected her not to be a true

maid: a point about which he entertained an extreme delicacy. He

continued, however, to be civil to Anne; he even seemed to repose his

usual confidence in Cromwell; but though he exerted this command over

himself, a discontent lay lurking in his breast, and was ready to burst

out on the first opportunity.

 

A session of parliament was held; and none of the abbots were now allowed

a place in the house of peers. The king, by the mouth of the chancellor,

complained to the parliament of the great diversity of religions which

still prevailed among his subjects; a grievance, he affirmed, which ought

the less to be endured, because the Scriptures were now published in

English, and ought universally to be the standard of belief to all

mankind. But he had appointed, he said, some bishops and divines to draw

up a list of tenets to which his people were to assent; and he was

determined, that Christ, the doctrine of Christ, and the truth, should

have the victory. The king seems to have expected more effect in

ascertaining truth from this new book of his doctors, than had ensued from

the publication of the Scriptures. Cromwell, as vicar-general, made also

in the king’s name a speech to the upper house; and the peers, in return,

bestowed great flattery on him, and in particular said, that he was

worthy, by his desert, to be vicar-general of the universe. That minister

seemed to be no less in his master’s good graces: he received, soon after

the sitting of the parliament, the title of earl of Essex, and was

installed knight of the garter.

 

There remained only one religious order in England; the knights of St.

John of Jerusalem, or the knights of Malta, as they are commonly called.

This order, partly ecclesiastical, partly military, had by their valor

done great service to Christendom; and had very much retarded, at

Jerusalem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid progress of the barbarians. During

the general surrender of the religious houses in England, they had exerted

their spirit, and had obstinately refused to yield up their revenues to

the king; and Henry, who would endure no society that professed obedience

to the pope, was obliged to have recourse to parliament for the

dissolution of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed an

addition nowise contemptible to the many acquisitions which the king had

already made. But he had very ill husbanded the great revenue acquired by

the plunder of the church: his profuse generosity dissipated faster than

his rapacity could supply; and the parliament was surprised this session

to find a demand made upon them of four tenths, and a subsidy of one

shilling in the pound during two years: so ill were the public

expectations answered, that the crown was never more to require any supply

from the people. The commons, though lavish of their liberty, and of the

blood of their fellow-subjects, were extremely frugal of their money; and

it was not without difficulty so small a grant could be obtained by this

absolute and dreaded monarch. The convocation gave the king four shillings

in the pound to be levied in two years. The pretext for these grants was,

the great expense which Henry had undergone for the defence of the realm,

in building forts along the seacoast, and in equipping a navy. As he had

at present no ally on the continent in whom he reposed much confidence, he

relied only on his domestic strength, and was on that account obliged to

be more expensive in his preparations against the danger of an invasion.

 

The king’s favor to Cromwell and his acquiescence in the marriage with

Anne of Cleves, were both of them deceitful appearances: his aversion to

the queen secretly increased every day; and having at last broken all

restraint, it prompted him at once to seek the dissolution of a marriage

so odious to him, and to involve his minister in ruin, who had been the

innocent author of it. The fall of Cromwell was hastened by other causes.

All the nobility hated a man who, being of such low extraction, had not

only mounted above them by his station of vicar-general, but had engrossed

many of the other considerable offices of the crown: besides enjoying that

commission, which gave him a high and almost absolute authority over the

clergy, and even over the laity, he was privy seal, chamberlain, and

master of the wards: he had also obtained the order of the garter, a

dignity which had ever been conferred only on men of illustrious families,

and which seemed to be profaned by its being communicated to so mean a

person. The people were averse to him, as the supposed author of the

violence on the monasteries; establishments which were still revered and

beloved by the commonalty. The Catholics regarded him as the concealed

enemy of their religion: the Protestants, observing his exterior

concurrence with all the persecutions exercised against them, were

inclined to bear him as little favor; and reproached him with the

timidity, if not treachery, of his conduct. And the king, who found that

great clamors had on all hands arisen against the administration, was not

displeased to throw on Cromwell the load of public hatred; and he hoped,

by making so easy a sacrifice, to regain the affections of his subjects.

 

But there was another cause which suddenly set all these motives in

action, and brought about an unexpected revolution in the ministry. The

king had fixed his affection on Catharine Howard, niece to the duke of

Norfolk; and being determined to gratify this new passion, he could find

no expedient, but by procuring a divorce from his present consort, to

raise Catharine to his bed and throne. The duke, who had long been engaged

in enmity with Cromwell, made the same use of her insinuations to ruin

this minister, that he had formerly done of Anne Boleyn’s against Wolsey;

and when all engines were prepared, he obtained a commission from the king

to arrest Cromwell at the council table, on an accusation of high treason,

and to commit him to the Tower. Immediately after a bill of attainder was

framed against him; and the house of peers thought proper, without trial,

examination, or evidence, to condemn to death a man, whom a few days

before they had declared worthy to be vicar-general of the universe. The

house of commons passed the bill, though not without some opposition.

Cromwell was accused of heresy and treason: but the proofs of his

treasonable practices are utterly improbable, and even absolutely

ridiculous.[*] The only circumstance of his conduct by which he seems to

have merited this fate, was his being the instrument of the king’s tyranny

in conducting like iniquitous bills, in the preceding session, against the

countess of Salisbury and others.

 

Cromwell endeavored to soften the king by the most humble supplications;

but all to no purpose: it was not the practice of that prince to ruin his

ministers and favorites by halves; and though the unhappy prisoner once

wrote to him in so moving a strain as even to draw tears from his eyes, he

hardened himself against all movements of pity, and refused his pardon.

The conclusion of Cromwell’s letter ran in these words: “I, a most woful

prisoner, am ready to submit to death when it shall please God and your

majesty; and yet the frail flesh incites me to call to your grace for

mercy and pardon of mine offences. Written at the Tower, with the heavy

heart and trembling hand of your highness’s most miserable prisoner and

poor slave, Thomas Cromwell.” And a little below, “Most gracious prince, I

cry for mercy, mercy, mercy.”[**]

 

When brought to the place of execution, he avoided all earnest

protestations of his innocence, and all complaints against the sentence

pronounced upon him. He knew that Henry would resent on his son those

symptoms of opposition to his will, and that his death alone would not

terminate that monarch’s vengeance. He was a man of prudence, industry,

and abilities; worthy of a better master and of a better fate. Though

raised to the summit of power from a low origin, he betrayed no insolence

or contempt towards his inferiors; and was careful to remember all the

obligations which, during his more humble fortune, he had owed to any one.

He had served as a private sentinel in the Italian wars; when he received

some good offices from a Lucquese merchant, who had entirely forgotten his

person, as well as the service which he had rendered him. Cromwell, in his

grandeur, happened at London to cast his eye on his benefactor, now

reduced to poverty by misfortunes. He immediately sent for him, reminded

him of their ancient friendship, and by his grateful assistance reinstated

him in his former prosperity and opulence.[*]

 

The measures for divorcing Henry from Anne of Cleves were carried on at

the same time with the bill of attainder against Cromwell. The house of

peers, in conjunction with the commons, applied to the king by petition,

desiring that he would allow his marriage to be examined; and orders were

immediately given to lay the matter before the convocation. Anne had

formerly been contracted by her father to the duke of Lorraine, but she,

as well as the duke, were at that time under age, and the contract had

been afterwards annulled by consent of both parties.

 

The king, however, pleaded this precontract as a ground of divorce; and he

added two reasons more, which may seem a little extraordinary; that, when

he espoused Anne he had not inwardly given his consent, and that he had

not thought proper to consummate the marriage. The convocation was

satisfied with these reasons, and solemnly annulled the marriage between

the king and queen: the parliament ratified the decision of the

clergy;[**] 16 and the sentence was soon after notified to the

princess.

 

Anne was blest with a happy insensibility of temper, ever in the points

which the most nearly affect her sex; and the king’s aversion towards her,

as well as his prosecution of the divorce, had never given her the least

uneasiness. She willingly hearkened to terms of accommodation with him;

and when he offered to adopt her as his sister, to give her place next the

queen and his own daughter, and to make a settlement of three thousand

pounds a year upon her; she accepted of the conditions, and gave her

consent to the divorce.[***] She even wrote to her brother, (for her

father was now dead,) that she had been very well used in England, and

desired him to live on good terms with the king. The only instance of

pride which she betrayed was, that she refused to return to her own

country after the affront which she had received; and she lived and died

in England.

 

Notwithstanding Anne’s moderation, this incident produced a great coldness

between the king and the German princes; but as the situation of Europe

was now much altered, Henry was the more indifferent about their

resentment. The close intimacy which had taken place between Francis and

Charles had subsisted during a very short time: the dissimilarity of their

characters soon renewed, with greater violence than ever, their former

jealousy and hatred. While Charles remained at Paris, Francis had been

imprudently engaged, by his open temper, and by that satisfaction which a

noble mind naturally feels in performing generous actions, to make in

confidence some dangerous discoveries to that interested monarch; and

having now lost all suspicion of his rival, he hoped that the emperor and

he, supporting each other, might neglect every other alliance. He not only

communicated to his guest the state of his negotiations with Sultan

Solyman and the Venetians; he also laid open the solicitations which he

had received from the court of England to enter into a confederacy against

him.[*] Charles had no sooner reached his own dominions, than he showed

himself unworthy of the friendly reception which he had met with. He

absolutely refused to fulfil his promise, and put the duke of Orleans in

possession of the Milanese; he informed Solyman and the senate of Venice

of the treatment which they had received from their ally; and he took care

that Henry should not be ignorant how readily Francis had abandoned his

ancient friend, to whom he owed such important obligations, and had

sacrificed him to a new confederate: he even poisoned and misrepresented

many things which the unsuspecting heart of the French monarch had

disclosed to him. Had Henry possessed true judgment and generosity, this

incident alone had been sufficient to guide him in the choice of his ally.

But his domineering pride carried him immediately to renounce the

friendship of Francis, who had so unexpectedly given the preference to the

emperor; and as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient amity, he

willingly accepted of the offer; and thinking himself secure in this

alliance, he neglected the friendship both of France and of the German

princes.

 

The new turn which Henry had taken with regard to foreign affairs was

extremely agreeable to his Catholic subjects; and as it had perhaps

contributed, among other reasons, to the ruin of Cromwell, it made them

entertain hopes of a final prevalence over their antagonists. The marriage

of the king with Catharine Howard, which followed soon after his divorce

from Anne of Cleves, was also regarded as a favorable incident to their

party; and the subsequent events corresponded to their expectations. The

king’s councils being now directed by Norfolk and Gardiner, a furious

persecution commenced against the Protestants; and the law of the six

articles was executed with rigor. Dr. Barnes, who had been the cause of

Lambert’s execution, felt, in his turn, the severity of the persecuting

spirit; and, by a bill which passed in parliament, he was, without trial,

condemned to the flames, together with Jerome and Gerrard. He discussed

theological questions even at the stake; and as the dispute between him

and the sheriff turned upon the invocation of saints, he said, that he

doubted whether the saints could pray for us; but if they could, he hoped

in half an hour to be praying for the sheriff and all the spectators. He

next entreated the sheriff to carry to the king his dying request, which

he fondly imagined would have authority with that monarch who had sent him

to the stake. The purport of his request was, that Henry, besides

repressing superstitious ceremonies, should be extremely vigilant in

preventing fornication and common swearing.[*]

 

While Henry was exerting this violence against the Protestants, he spared

not the Catholics who denied his supremacy; and a foreigner, at that time

in England, had reason to say, that those who were against the pope were

burned, and those who were for him were hanged.[**] The king even

displayed in an ostentatious manner this tyrannical impartiality, which

reduced both parties to subjection, and infused terror into every breast.

Barnes, Gerrard, and Jerome had been carried to the place of execution on

three hurdles; and along with them there was placed on each hurdle a

Catholic, who was also executed for his religion. These Catholics were

Abel, Fetherstone, and Powel, who declared, that the most grievous part of

their punishment was the being coupled to such heretical miscreants as

suffered with them.[***]

 

Though the spirit of the English seemed to be totally sunk under the

despotic power of Henry, there appeared some symptoms of discontent. An

inconsiderable rebellion broke out in Yorkshire, headed by Sir John Nevil;

but it was soon suppressed, and Nevil, with other ringleaders, was

executed.

 

The rebels were supposed to have been instigated by the intrigues of

Cardinal Pole; and the king was instantly determined to make the countess

of Salisbury, who already lay under sentence of death, suffer for her

son’s offences. He ordered her to be carried to execution; and this

venerable matron maintained still, in these distressful circumstances, the

spirit of that long race of monarchs from whom she was descended.[*] She

refused to lay her head on the block, or submit to a sentence where she

had received no trial. She told the executioner, that if he would have her

head, he must win it the best way he could: and thus, shaking her

venerable gray locks, she ran about the scaffold: and the executioner

followed with his axe, aiming many fruitless blows at her neck, before he

was able to give the fatal stroke. Thus perished the last of the line of

Plantagenet, which, with great glory, but still greater crimes and

misfortunes, had governed England for the space of three hundred years.

Lord Leonard Grey, a man who had formerly rendered service to the crown,

was also beheaded for treason, soon after the countess of Salisbury. We

know little concerning the grounds of his prosecution.

 

1541.

 

The insurrection in the north engaged Henry to make a progress thither, in

order to quiet the minds of his people, to reconcile them to his

government, and to abolish the ancient superstitions, to which those parts

were much addicted. He had also another motive for this journey: he

purposed to have a conference at York with his nephew the king of

Scotland, and, if possible, to cement a close and indissoluble union with

that kingdom.

 

The same spirit of religious innovation which had seized other parts of

Europe had made its way into Scotland, and had begun, before this period,

to excite the same jealousies fears, and persecutions. About the year

1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man of a noble family, having been created

abbot of Fene, was sent abroad for his education, but had fallen into

company with some reformers; and he returned into his own country very ill

disposed towards that church, on which his birth and his merit entitled

him to attain the highest dignities, The fervor of youth and his zeal for

novelty made it impossible for him to conceal his sentiments and Campbell,

prior of the Dominicans, who, under color of friendship, and a sympathy in

opinion, had insinuated himself into his confidence, accused him before

Beaton, archbishop of St. Andrews. Hamilton was invited to St. Andrews, in

order to maintain with some of the clergy a dispute concerning the

controverted points; and after much reasoning with regard to

justification, free will, original sin, and other topics of that nature,

the conference ended with their condemning Hamilton to be burned for his

errors. The young man, who had been deaf to the insinuations of ambition,

was less likely to be shaken with the fears of death; while he proposed to

himself, both the glory of bearing testimony to the truth, and the

immediate reward attending his martyrdom. The people, who compassionated

his youth, his virtue, and his noble birth, were much moved at the

constancy of his end; and an incident which soon followed still more

confirmed them in their favorable sentiments towards him. He had cited

Campbell, who still insulted him at the stake, to answer before the

judgment seat of Christ; and as that persecutor, either astonished with

these events, or overcome with remorse, or perhaps seized casually with a

distemper, soon after lost his senses, and fell into a fever, of which he

died; the people regarded Hamilton as a prophet as well as a martyr.[*]

 

Among the disciples converted by Hamilton, was one friar Forrest, who

became a zealous preacher; and who, though he did not openly discover his

sentiments, was suspected to lean towards the new opinions. His diocesan,

the bishop of Dunkel, enjoined him, when he met with a good epistle or

good gospel, which favored the liberties of holy church, to preach on it,

and let the rest alone. Forrest replied, that he had read both Old and New

Testament, and had not found an ill epistle or ill gospel in any part of

them. The extreme attachment to the Scriptures was regarded, in those

days, as a sure characteristic of heresy; and Forrest was soon after

brought to trial, and condemned to the flames. While the priests were

deliberating on the place of his execution, a bystander advised them to

burn him in a cellar; for that the smoke of Mr. Patrick Hamilton had

infected all those on whom it blew.[**]

 

The clergy were at that time reduced to great difficulties, not only in

Scotland, but all over Europe. As the reformers aimed at a total

subversion of ancient establishments, which they represented as

idolatrous, impious, detestable; the priests, who found both their honors

and properties at stake, thought that they had a right to resist, by every

expedient, these dangerous invaders, and that the same simple principles

of equity which justified a man in killing a pirate or a robber, would

acquit them for the execution of such heretics. A toleration, though it is

never acceptable to ecclesiastics, might, they said, be admitted in other

cases; but seemed an absurdity where fundamentals were shaken, and where

the possessions and even the existence of the established clergy were

brought in danger. But though the church was thus carried by policy, as

well as inclination, to kindle the fires of persecution, they found the

success of this remedy very precarious; and observed, that the

enthusiastic zeal of the reformers, inflamed by punishment, was apt to

prove contagious on the compassionate minds of the spectators. The new

doctrine, amidst all the dangers to which it was exposed, secretly spread

itself every where; and the minds of men were gradually disposed to a

revolution in religion.

 

But the most dangerous symptom for the clergy in Scotland was, that the

nobility, from the example of England, had cast a wishful eye on the

church revenues, and hoped, if a reformation took place, to enrich

themselves by the plunder of the ecclesiastics. James himself, who was

very poor, and was somewhat inclined to magnificence, particularly in

building, had been swayed by like motives; and began to threaten the

clergy with the same fate that had attended them in the neighboring

country. Henry also never ceased exhorting his nephew to imitate his

example; and being moved, both by the pride of making proselytes, and the

prospect of security, should Scotland embrace a close union with him, he

solicited the king of Scots to meet him at York; and he obtained a promise

to that purpose.

 

The ecclesiastics were alarmed at this resolution of James, and they

employed every expedient in order to prevent the execution of it. They

represented the danger of innovation; the pernicious consequences of

aggrandizing the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting

himself into the hands of the English, his hereditary enemies; the

dependence on them which must ensue upon his losing the friendship of

France, and of all foreign powers. To those considerations they added the

prospect of immediate interest, by which they found the king to be much

governed: they offered him a present gratuity of fifty thousand pounds:

they promised him that the church should always be ready to contribute to

his supply: and they pointed out to him the confiscation of heretics, as

the means of filling his exchequer, and of adding a hundred thousand

pounds a year to the crown revenues.[*] The insinuations of his new queen,

to whom youth, beauty, and address had given a powerful influence over

him, seconded all these reasons; and James was at last engaged, first to

delay his journey, then to send excuses to the king of England, who had

already come to York in order to be present at the interview.[**]

 

Henry, vexed with the disappointment, and enraged at the affront, vowed

vengeance against his nephew; and he began, by permitting piracies at sea

and incursions at land, to put his threats in execution. But he received

soon after, in his own family, an affront to which he was much more

sensible, and which touched him in a point where he always showed an

extreme delicacy. He had thought himself very happy in his new marriage:

the agreeable person and disposition of Catharine had entirely captivated

his affections; and he made no secret of his devoted attachment to her. He

had even publicly, in his chapel, returned solemn thanks to Heaven for the

felicity which the conjugal state afforded him; and he directed the bishop

of Lincoln to compose a form of prayer for that purpose. But the queen’s

conduct very little merited this tenderness: one Lascelles brought

intelligence of her dissolute life to Cranmer; and told him that his

sister, formerly a servant in the family of the old duchess of Norfolk,

with whom Catharine was educated, had given him a particular account of

her licentious manners. Derham and Mannoc, both of them servants to the

duchess, had been admitted to her bed; and she had even taken little care

to conceal her shame from the other servants of the family. The primate,

struck with this intelligence, which it was equally dangerous to conceal

or to discover, communicated the matter to the earl of Hertford and to the

chancellor. They agreed, that the matter should by no means be buried in

silence; and the archbishop himself seemed the most proper person to

disclose it to the king. Cranmer, unwilling to speak on so delicate a

subject, wrote a narrative of the whole, and conveyed it to Henry, who was

infinitely astonished at the intelligence. So confident was he of the

fidelity of his consort, that at first he gave no credit to the

information; and he said to the privy-seal, to Lord Russel, high admiral,

Sir Anthony Brown, and Wriothesley, that he regarded the whole as a

falsehood. Cranmer was now in a very perilous situation; and had not full

proof been found, certain and inevitable destruction hung over him. The

king’s impatience, however, and jealousy prompted him to search the matter

to the bottom; the privy-seal was ordered to examine Lascelles, who

persisted in the information he had given; and still appealed to his

sister’s testimony. That nobleman next made a journey, under pretence of

hunting, and went to Sussex, where the woman at that time resided: he

found her both constant in her former intelligence, and particular as to

the facts; and the whole bore but too much the face of probability. Mannoc

and Derham, who were arrested at the same time, and examined by the

chancellor, made the queen’s guilt entirely certain by their confession;

and discovered other particulars, which redounded still more to her

dishonor. Three maids of the family were admitted into her secrets; and

some of them had even passed the night in bed with her and her lovers. All

the examinations were laid before the king, who was so deeply affected,

that he remained a long time speechless, and at last burst into tears. He

found to his surprise, that his great skill in distinguishing a true maid,

of which he boasted in the case of Anne of Cleves, had failed him in that

of his present consort. The queen, being next questioned, denied her

guilt; but when informed that a full discovery was made, she confessed

that she had been criminal before marriage; and only insisted that she had

never been false to the king’s bed. But as there was evidence that one

Colepepper had passed the night with her alone since her marriage; and as

it appeared that she had taken Derham, her old paramour, into her service,

she seemed to deserve little credit in this asseveration; and the king,

besides, was not of a humor to make any difference between these degrees

of guilt.

 

1542.

 

Henry found that he could not by any means so fully or expeditiously

satiate his vengeance on all these criminals as by assembling a

parliament, the usual instrument of his tyranny. The two houses, having

received the queen’s confession, made an address to the king. They

entreated him not to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all

men were subject; but to consider the frailty of human nature, and the

mutability of human affairs; and from these views to derive a subject of

consolation. They desired leave to pass a bill of attainder against the

queen and her accomplices; and they begged him to give his assent to this

bill, not in person, which would renew his vexation, and might endanger

his health, but by commissioners appointed for that purpose. And as there

was a law in force making it treason to speak ill of the queen as well as

of the king, they craved his royal pardon if any of them should, on the

present occasion, have transgressed any part of the statute.

 

Having obtained a gracious answer to these requests, the parliament

proceeded to vote a bill of attainder for treason against the queen, and

the viscountess of Rocheford, who had conducted her secret amours; and in

this bill Colepepper and Derham were also comprehended. At the same time

they passed a bill of attainder for misprision of treason against the old

duchess of Norfolk, Catharine’s grandmother; her uncle, Lord William

Howard, and his lady, together with the countess of Bridgewater, and nine

persons more; because they knew the queen’s vicious course of life before

her marriage, and had concealed it. This was an effect of Henry’s usual

extravagance, to expect that parents should so far forget the ties of

natural affection, and the sentiments of shame and decency, as to reveal

to him the most secret disorders of their family. He himself seems to have

been sensible of the cruelty of this proceeding; for he pardoned the

duchess of Norfolk and most of the others condemned for misprision of

treason.

 

However, to secure himself for the future, as well as his successors, from

this fatal accident, he engaged the parliament to pass a law somewhat

extraordinary. It was enacted, that any one who knew, or vehemently

suspected, any guilt in the queen, might, within twenty days, disclose it

to the king or council, without incurring the penalty of any former law

against defaming the queen; but prohibiting every one at the same time,

from spreading the matter abroad, or even privately whispering it to

others. It was also enacted, that if the king married any woman who had

been incontinent, taking her for a true maid, she should be guilty of

treason, if she did not previously reveal her guilt to him. The people

made merry with this singular clause, and said that the king must

henceforth look out for a widow; for no reputed maid would ever be

persuaded to incur the penalty of the statute.[*] After all these laws

were passed, the queen was beheaded on Tower Hill, together with Lady

Rocheford. They behaved in a manner suitable to their dissolute life; and

as Lady Rocheford was known to be the chief instrument in bringing Anne

Boleyn to her end, she died unpitied; and men were further confirmed, by

the discovery of this woman’s guilt, in the favorable sentiments which

they had entertained of that unfortunate queen.

 

The king made no demand of any subsidy from this parliament; but he found

means of enriching his exchequer from another quarter: he took further

steps towards the dissolution of colleges, hospitals, and other

foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been practising on the

presidents and governors to make a surrender of their revenues to the

king, and they had been successful with eight of them. But there was an

obstacle to their further progress: it had been provided by the local

statutes of most of these foundations, that no president, or any number of

fellows, could consent to such a deed without the unanimous vote of all

the fellows; and this vote was not easily obtained. All such statutes were

annulled by parliament; and the revenues of these houses were now exposed

to the rapacity of the king and his favorites.[**] 17 The Church had been so

long their prey, that nobody was surprised at any new inroads made upon

her. From the regular, Henry now proceeded to make devastations on the

secular clergy. He extorted from many of the bishops a surrender of

chapter lands; and by this device he pillaged the sees of Canterbury,

York, and London, and enriched his greedy parasites and flatterers with

their spoils.

 

The clergy have been commonly so fortunate as to make a concern for their

temporal interests go hand in hand with a jealousy for orthodoxy; and both

these passions be regarded by the people, ignorant and superstitious, as

proofs of zeal for religion: but the violent and headstrong character of

Henry now disjoined these objects. His rapacity was gratified by

plundering the church, his bigotry and arrogance by persecuting heretics.

Though he engaged the parliament to mitigate the penalties of the six

articles, so far as regards the marriage of priests, which was now only

subjected to a forfeiture of goods, chattels, and lands during life, he

was still equally bent on maintaining a rigid purity in speculative

principles. He had appointed a commission, consisting of the two

archbishops and several bishops of both provinces, together with a

considerable number of doctors of divinity; and by virtue of his

ecclesiastical supremacy, he had given them in charge to choose a religion

for his people. Before the commissioners had made any progress in this

arduous undertaking, the parliament, in 1541, had passed a law by which

they ratified all the tenets which these divines should thereafter

establish with the king’s consent: and they were not ashamed of thus

expressly declaring that they took their religion upon trust, and had no

other rule, in spiritual as well as temporal concerns, than the arbitrary

will of their master. There is only one clause of the statute which may

seem at first sight to savor somewhat of the spirit of liberty: it was

enacted, that the ecclesiastical commissioners should establish nothing

repugnant to the laws and statutes of the realm. But in reality this

proviso was inserted by the king to serve his own purposes. By introducing

a confusion and contradiction into the laws, he became more master of

every one’s life and property. And as the ancient independence of the

church still gave him jealousy, he was well pleased, undercover of such a

clause, to introduce appeals from the spiritual to the civil courts. It

was for a like reason that he would never promulgate a body of canon law;

and he encouraged the judges on all occasions to interpose in

ecclesiastical causes, wherever they thought the law of royal prerogative

concerned; a happy innovation, though at first invented for arbitrary

purposes.

 

The king, armed by the authority of parliament, or rather by their

acknowledgment of that spiritual supremacy which he believed inherent in

him, employed his commissioners to select a system of tenets for the

assent and belief of the nation. A small volume was soon after published,

called the Institution of a Christian Man, which was received by the

convocation, and voted to be the standard of orthodoxy. All the delicate

points of justification, faith, free will, good works, and grace, are

there defined, with a leaning towards the opinion of the reformers: the

sacraments, which a few years before were only allowed to be three, were

now increased to the number of seven, conformable to the sentiments of the

Catholics. The king’s caprice is discernible throughout the whole; and the

book is in reality to be regarded as his composition. For Henry while he

made his opinion a rule for the nation, would tie his own hands by no

canon or authority, not even by any which he himself had formerly

established.

 

The people had occasion soon after to see a further instance of the king’s

inconstancy. He was not long satisfied with his Institution of a Christian

Man: he ordered a new book to be composed, called the Erudition of a

Christian Man; and without asking the assent of the convocation, he

published, by his own authority and that of the parliament, this new model

of orthodoxy. It differs from the Institution;[*] but the king was no less

positive in his new creed than he had been in the old; and he required the

belief of the nation to veer about at his signal. In both these

compositions, he was particularly careful to inculcate the doctrine of

passive obedience; and he was equally careful to retain the nation in the

practice.

 

While the king was spreading his own books among the people, he seems to

have been extremely perplexed, as were also the clergy, what course to

take with the Scriptures. A review had been made by the synod of the new

translation of the Bible; and Gardiner had proposed that, instead of

employing English expressions throughout, several Latin words should still

be preserved; because they contained, as he pretended, such peculiar

energy and significance, that they had no correspondent terms in the

vulgar tongue.[**] Among these were “ecclesia, poenitentia, pontifex,

contritus, holocausta, sacramentum, elementa, ceremonia, mysterium,

presbyter, sacrificium, humilitas, satisfactio, peccatum, gratia, hostia,

charitos,” etc. But as this mixture would have appeared extremely

barbarous, and was plainly calculated for no other purpose than to retain

the people in their ancient ignorance, the proposal was rejected. The

knowledge of the people, however, at least their disputative turn, seemed

to be an inconvenience still more dangerous; and the king and

parliament,[***] soon after the publication of the Scriptures retracted

the concession which they had formerly made; and prohibited all but

gentlemen and merchants from perusing them[****].

 

Even that liberty was not granted without an apparent hesitation, and a

dread of the consequences: these persons were allowed to read, “so it be

done quietly and with good order.” And the preamble to the act sets forth

“that many seditious and ignorant persons had abused the liberty granted

them of reading the Bible, and that great diversity of opinion,

animosities, tumults, and schisms had been occasioned by perverting the

sense of the Scriptures.” It seemed very difficult to reconcile the king’s

model for uniformity with the permission of free inquiry.

 

The mass book also passed under the king’s revisal; and little alteration

was as yet made in it: some doubtful or fictious saints only were struck

out; and the name of the pope was erased. This latter precaution was

likewise used with regard to every new book that was printed, or even old

book that was sold. The word “pope” was carefully omitted or blotted

out;[*] as if that precaution could abolish the term from the language, or

as if such a persecution of it did not rather imprint it more strongly in

the memory of the people.

 

The king took care about this time to clear the churches from another

abuse which had crept into them. Plays, interludes, and farces were there

often acted in derision of the former superstitions; and the reverence of

the multitude for ancient principles and modes of worship was thereby

gradually effaced.[**] We do not hear that the Catholics attempted to

retaliate by employing this powerful engine against their adversaries, or

endeavored by like arts to expose that fanatical spirit by which it

appears the reformers were frequently actuated. Perhaps the people were

not disposed to relish a jest on that side: perhaps the greater simplicity

and the more spiritual abstract worship of the Protestants gave less hold

to ridicule, which is commonly founded on sensible representations. It

was, therefore, a very agreeable concession which the king made to the

Catholic party, to suppress entirely these religious comedies.

 

Thus Henry labored incessantly by arguments, creeds, and penal statutes,

to bring his subjects to a uniformity in their religious sentiments: but

as he entered himself with the greatest earnestness into all those

scholastic disputes, he encouraged the people by his example to apply

themselves to the study of theology; and it was in vain afterwards to

expect, however present fear might restrain their tongues or pens, that

they would cordially agree in any set of tenets or opinions prescribed to

them.
