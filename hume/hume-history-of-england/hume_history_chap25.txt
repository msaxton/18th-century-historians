The king acquired great reputation throughout Europe by the vigorous and

prosperous conduct of his domestic affairs; but as some incidents about

this time invited him to look abroad, and exert himself in behalf of his

allies, it will be necessary, in order to give a just account of his

foreign measures, to explain the situation of the neighboring kingdoms,

beginning with Scotland, which lies most contiguous.

 

The kingdom of Scotland had not yet attained that state which

distinguishes a civilized monarchy, and which enables the government, by

the force of its laws and institutions alone, without any extraordinary

capacity in the sovereign, to maintain itself in order and tranquillity.

James III., who now filled the throne, was a prince of little industry and

of a narrow genius; and though it behoved him to yield the reins of

government to his ministers, he had never been able to make any choice

which could give contentment both to himself and to his people. When he

bestowed his confidence on any of the principal nobility, he found that

they exalted their own family to such a height as was dangerous to the

prince, and gave umbrage to the state: when he conferred favor on any

person of meaner birth, on whose submission he could more depend, the

barons of his kingdom, enraged at the power of an upstart minion,

proceeded to the utmost extremities against their sovereign. Had Henry

entertained the ambition of conquests, a tempting opportunity now offered

of reducing that kingdom to subjection; but as he was probably sensible

that a warlike people, though they might be overrun by reason of their

domestic divisions, could not be retained in obedience without a regular

military force, which was then unknown in England, he rather intended the

renewal of the peace with Scotland, and sent an embassy to James for that

purpose. But the Scots, who never desired a durable peace with England,

and who deemed their security to consist in constantly preserving

themselves in a warlike posture, would not agree to more than a seven

years’ truce, which was accordingly concluded.[*]

 

The European states on the continent were then hastening fast to the

situation in which they have remained, without any material alteration,

for near three centuries; and began to unite themselves into one extensive

system of policy, which comprehended the chief powers of Christendom.

Spain, which had hitherto been almost entirely occupied within herself,

now became formidable by the union of Arragon and Castile in the persons

of Ferdinand and Isabella, who, being princes of great capacity, employed

their force in enterprises the most advantageous to their combined

monarchy. The conquest of Granada from the Moors was then undertaken, and

brought near to a happy conclusion. And in that expedition the military

genius of Spain was revived; honor and security were attained; and her

princes, no longer kept in awe by a domestic enemy so dangerous, began to

enter into all the transactions of Europe, and make a great figure in

every war and negotiation.

 

Maximilian, king of the Romans, son of the emperor Frederick, had, by his

marriage with the heiress of Burgundy, acquired an interest in the

Netherlands; and though the death of his consort had weakened his

connections with that country, he still pretended to the government as

tutor to his son Philip, and his authority had been acknowledged by

Brabant, Holland, and several of the provinces. But as Flanders and

Hainault still refused to submit to his regency, and even appointed other

tutors to Philip, he had been engaged in long wars against that obstinate

people, and never was able thoroughly to subdue their spirit. That he

might free himself from the opposition of France, he had concluded a peace

with Lewis XI., and had given his daughter Margaret, then an infant, in

marriage to the dauphin; together with Artois, Franche Compte, and

Charolois, as her dowry. But this alliance had not produced the desired

effect. The dauphin succeeded to the crown of France by the appellation of

Charles VIII.; but Maximilian still found the mutinies of the Flemings

fomented by the intrigues of the court of France.

 

France, during the two preceding reigns, had made a mighty increase in

power and greatness; and had not other states of Europe at the same time

received an accession of force, it had been impossible to have retained

her within her ancient boundaries. Most of the great fiefs, Normandy,

Champagne, Anjou, Dauphny, Guienne, Provence, and Burgundy, had been

united to the crown; the English had been expelled from all their

conquests; the authority of the prince had been raised to such a height as

enabled him to maintain law and order; a considerable military force was

kept on foot, and the finances were able to support it. Lewis XI, indeed,

from whom many of these advantages were derived, was dead, and had left

his son, in early youth and ill educated, to sustain the weight of the

monarchy: but having intrusted the government to his daughter Anne, lady

of Beaujeu, a woman of spirit and capacity, the French power suffered no

check or decline. On the contrary, this princess formed the great project,

which at last she happily effected, of uniting to the crown Brittany, the

last and most independent fief of the monarchy.

 

Francis II., duke of Brittany, conscious of his own incapacity for

government, had resigned himself to the direction of Peter Landais, a man

of mean birth, more remarkable for abilities than for virtue or integrity.

The nobles of Brittany, displeased with the great advancement of this

favorite, had even proceeded to disaffection against their sovereign; and

after many tumults and disorders, they at last united among themselves,

and in a violent manner seized, tried, and put to death the obnoxious

minister. Dreading the resentment of the prince for this invasion of his

authority, many of them retired to France; others, for protection and

safety, maintained a secret correspondence with the French ministry, who,

observing the great dissensions among the Bretons, thought the opportunity

favorable for invading the duchy; and so much the rather as they could

cover their ambition under the specious pretence of providing for domestic

security.

 

Lewis, duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, and presumptive heir of

the monarchy, had disputed the administration with the lady of Beaujeu;

and though his pretensions had been rejected by the states, he still

maintained cabals with many of the grandees, and laid schemes for

subverting the authority of that princess. Finding his conspiracies

detected, he took to arms, and fortified himself in Beaugeune; but as his

revolt was precipitate, before his confederates were ready to join him, he

had been obliged to submit, and to receive such conditions as the French

ministry were pleased to impose upon him. Actuated, however, by his

ambition, and even by his fears, he soon retired out of France, and took

shelter with the duke of Brittany, who was desirous of strengthening

himself against the designs of the lady of Beaujeu by the friendship and

credit of the duke of Orleans. This latter prince also, perceiving the

ascendant which he soon acquired over the duke of Brittany, had engaged

many of his partisans to join him at that court, and had formed the design

of aggrandizing himself by a marriage with Anne, the heir of that opulent

duchy.

 

The barons of Brittany, who saw all favor engrossed by the duke of Orleans

and his train, renewed a stricter correspondence with France, and even

invited the French king to make an invasion on their country. Desirous,

however, of preserving its independency, they had regulated the number of

succors which France was to send them, and had stipulated that no

fortified place in Brittany should remain in the possession of that

monarchy; a vain precaution, where revolted subjects treat with a power so

much superior! The French invaded Brittany with forces three times more

numerous than those which they had promised to the barons; and advancing

into the heart of the country, laid siege to Ploerrnel. To oppose them,

the duke raised a numerous but ill-disciplined army, which he put under

the command of the duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others of the

French nobility. The army, discontented with this choice, and jealous of

their confederates, soon disbanded, and left their prince with too small a

force to keep the field against his invaders. He retired to Vannes; but

being hotly pursued by the French, who had now made themselves masters of

Ploermel, he escaped to Nantz; and the enemy, having previously taken and

garrisoned Vannes, Dinant, and other places, laid close siege to that

city. The barons of Brittany, finding their country menaced with total

subjection, began gradually to withdraw from the French army, and to make

peace with their sovereign.

 

This desertion, however, of the Bretons discouraged not the court of

France from pursuing her favorite project of reducing Brittany to

subjection The situation of Europe appeared favorable to the execution of

this design. Maximilian was indeed engaged in close alliance with the duke

of Brittany and had even opened a treaty for marrying his daughter; but he

was on all occasions so indigent, and at that time so disquieted by the

mutinies of the Flemings, that little effectual assistance could be

expected from him. Ferdinand was entirely occupied in the conquest of

Granada; and it was also known, that if France would resign to him

Roussillon and Cerdagne, to which he had pretensions, she could at any

time engage him to abandon the interests of Brittany. England, alone, was

both enabled by her power, and engaged by her interests, to support the

independency of that duchy; and the most dangerous opposition was

therefore, by Anne of Beaujeu, expected from that quarter. In order to

cover her real designs, no sooner was she informed of Henry’s success

against Simnel and his partisans, than she despatched ambassadors to the

court of London, and made professions of the greatest trust and confidence

in that monarch.

 

The ambassadors, after congratulating Henry on his late victory, and

communicating to him, in the most cordial manner, as to an intimate

friend, some successes of their master against Maximilian, came in the

progress of their discourse to mention the late transactions in Brittany.

They told him that the duke having given protection to French fugitives

and rebels, the king had been necessitated, contrary to his intention and

inclination, to carry war into that duchy; that the honor of the crown was

interested not to suffer a vassal so far to forget his duty to his liege

lord; nor was the security of the government less concerned to prevent the

consequences of this dangerous temerity: that the fugitives were no mean

or obscure persons; but among others, the duke of Orleans, first prince of

the blood, who, finding himself obnoxious to justice for treasonable

practices in France, had fled into Brittany; where he still persevered in

laying schemes of rebellion against his sovereign: that the war being

thus, on the part of the French monarch, entirely defensive, it would

immediately cease, when the duke of Brittany, by returning to his duty,

should remove the causes of it: that their master was sensible of the

obligations which the duke, in very critical times, had conferred on

Henry; but it was known also, that, in times still more critical, he or

his mercenary counsellors had deserted him, and put his life in the utmost

hazard: that his sole refuge in these desperate extremities had been the

court of France, which not only protected his person, but supplied him

with men and money, with which, aided by his own valor and conduct, he had

been enabled to mount the throne of England; that France in this

transaction had, from friendship to Henry acted contrary to what, in a

narrow view, might be esteemed her own interest; since, instead of an

odious tyrant, she had contributed to establish on a rival throne a prince

endowed with such virtue and abilities; and that, as both the justice of

the cause and the obligations conferred on Henry thus preponderated on the

side of France, she reasonably expected that, if the situation of his

affairs did not permit him to give her assistance, he would at least

preserve a neutrality between the contending parties.[*]

 

This discourse of the French ambassadors was plausible; and to give it

greater weight, they communicated to Henry, as in confidence, their

master’s intention, after he should have settled the differences with

Brittany to lead an army into Italy, and make good his pretensions to the

kingdom of Naples; a project which, they knew, would give no umbrage to

the court of England. But all these artifices were in vain employed

against the penetration of the king. He clearly saw that France had

entertained the view of subduing Brittany; but he also perceived, that she

would meet with great, and, as he thought, insuperable difficulties in the

execution of her project. The native force of that duchy, he knew, had

always been considerable, and had often, without any foreign assistance,

resisted the power of France; the natural temper of the French nation, he

imagined, would make them easily abandon any enterprise which required

perseverance; and as the heir of the crown was confederated with the duke

of Brittany, the ministers would be still more remiss in prosecuting a

scheme which must draw on them his resentment and displeasure. Should even

these internal obstructions be removed, Maximilian, whose enmity to France

was well known, and who now paid his addresses to the heiress of Brittany,

would be able to make a diversion on the side of Flanders; nor could it be

expected that France, if she prosecuted such ambitious projects, would be

allowed to remain in tranquillity by Ferdinand and Isabella. Above all, he

thought the French court could never expect that England, so deeply

interested to preserve the independency of Brittany, so able by her power

and situation to give effectual and prompt assistance, would permit such

an accession of force to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the

ministers of France, convinced of the impracticability of their scheme,

would at last embrace pacific views, and would abandon an enterprise so

obnoxious to all the potentates of Europe.

 

This reasoning of Henry was solid, and might justly engage him in dilatory

and cautious measures: but there entered into his conduct another motive,

which was apt to draw him beyond the just bounds, because founded on a

ruling passion. His frugality, which by degrees degenerated into avarice,

made him averse to all warlike enterprises and distant expeditions, and

engaged him previously to try the expedient of negotiation. He despatched

Urswic, his almoner, a man of address and abilities, to make offer of his

mediation to the contending parties; an offer which, he thought, if

accepted by France, would soon lead to a composure of all differences; if

refused or eluded, would at least discover the perseverance of that court

in her ambitious projects. Urswic found the lady of Beaujeu, now duchess

of Bourbon, engaged in the siege of Nantz, and had the satisfaction to

find that his master’s offer of mediation was readily embraced and with

many expressions of confidence and moderation. That able princess

concluded, that the duke of Orleans, who governed the court of Brittany,

foreseeing that every accommodation must be made at his expense, would use

all his interest to have Henry’s proposal rejected; and would by that

means make an apology for the French measures, and draw on the Bretons the

reproach of obstinacy and injustice. The event justified her prudence.

When the English ambassador made the same offer to the duke of Brittany,

he received for answer, in the name of that prince, that having so long

acted the part of protector and guardian to Henry during his youth and

adverse fortune, he had expected from a monarch of such virtue more

effectual assistance in his present distresses than a barren offer of

mediation, which suspended not the progress of the French arms: that if

Henry’s gratitude were not sufficient to engage him in such a measure, his

prudence, as king of England, should discover to him the pernicious

consequences attending the conquest of Brittany, and its annexation to the

crown of France: that that kingdom, already too powerful, would be

enabled, by so great an accession of force, to display, to the ruin of

England, that hostile disposition which had always subsisted between those

rival nations: that Brittany, so useful an ally, which, by its situation,

gave the English an entrance into the heart of France, being annexed to

that kingdom, would be equally enabled from its situation to disturb,

either by piracies or naval armaments, the commerce and peace cf England:

and that if the duke rejected Henry’s mediation, it proceeded neither from

an inclination to a war, which he experienced to be ruinous to him, nor

from a confidence in his own force, which he knew to be much inferior to

that of the enemy; but, on the contrary, from a sense of his present

necessities, which must engage the king to act the part of his

confederate, not that of a mediator.

 

When this answer was reported to the king, he abandoned not the plan which

he had formed; he only concluded that some more time was requisite to

quell the obstinacy of the Bretons, and make them submit to reason. And

when he learned that the people of Brittany, anxious for their duke’s

safety, had formed a tumultuary army of sixty thousand men, and had

obliged the French to raise the siege of Nantz, he fortified himself the

more in his opinion, that the court of France would at last be reduced, by

multiplied obstacles and difficulties, to abandon the project of reducing

Brittany to subjection. He continued, therefore, his scheme of

negotiation, and thereby exposed himself to be deceived by the artifices

of the French ministry; who, still pretending pacific intentions, sent

Lord Bernard Daubigni, a Scotchman of quality, to London, and pressed

Henry not to be discouraged in offering his mediation to the court of

Brittany. The king, on his part, despatched another embassy, consisting of

Urswic, the abbot of Abingdon, and Sir Richard Tonstal, who carried new

proposals for an amicable treaty. No effectual succors, meanwhile, were

provided for the distressed Bretons. Lord Woodville, brother to the queen

dowager, having asked leave to raise underhand a body of volunteers, and

to transport them into Brittany, met with a refusal from the king, who was

desirous of preserving the appearance of a strict neutrality. That

nobleman, however, still persisted in his purpose. He went over to the

Isle of Wight, of which he was governor, levied a body of four hundred

men; and having at last obtained, as is supposed, the secret permission of

Henry, sailed with them to Brittany. This enterprise proved fatal to the

leader, and brought small relief to the unhappy duke. The Bretons rashly

engaged in a general action with the French at St. Aubin, and were

discomfited. Woodville and all the English were put to the sword, together

with a body of Bretons, who had been accoutred in the garb of Englishmen

in order to strike a greater terror into the French, to whom the martial

prowess of that nation was always formidable.[*] The duke of Orleans the

prince of Orange, and many other persons of rank were taken prisoners; and

the military force of Brittany was totally broken. The death of the duke,

which followed soon after, threw affairs into still greater confusion, and

seemed to threaten the state with a final subjection.

 

Though the king did not prepare against these events, so hurtful to the

interests of England, with sufficient vigor and precaution, he had not

altogether overlooked them. Determined to maintain a pacific conduct, as

far as the situation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the warlike

temper of his subjects, and observed that their ancient and inveterate

animosity to France was now revived by the prospect of this great

accession to her power and grandeur. He resolved, therefore to make

advantage of this disposition, and draw some supplies from the people, on

pretence of giving assistance to the duke of Brittany. He had summoned a

parliament at Westminster;[**] and he soon persuaded them to grant him a

considerable subsidy.[***] But this supply, though voted by parliament,

involved the king in unexpected difficulties. The counties of Durham and

York, always discontented with Henry’s government, and further provoked by

the late oppressions under which they had labored, after the suppression

of Simnel’s rebellion, resisted the commissioners who were appointed to

levy the tax. The commissioners, terrified with this appearance of

sedition, made application to the earl of Northumberland, and desired of

him advice and assistance in the execution of their office. That nobleman

thought the matter of importance enough to consult the king; who,

unwilling to yield to the humors of a discontented populace, and

foreseeing the pernicious consequence of such a precedent, renewed his

orders for strictly levying the imposition. Northumberland summoned

together the justices and chief freeholders, and delivered the king’s

commands in the most imperious terms which, he thought, would enforce

obedience, but which tended only to provoke the people, and make them

believe him the adviser of those orders which he delivered to them. [****]

 

They flew to arms, attacked Northumberland in his house, and put him to

death. Having incurred such deep guilt, their mutinous humor prompted them

to declare against the king himself; and being instigated by John

Achamber, a seditious fellow of low birth, they chose Sir John Egremond

their leader, and prepared themselves for a vigorous resistance. Henry was

not dismayed with an insurrection so precipitate and ill supported. He

immediately levied a force, which he put under the command of the earl of

Surrey, whom he had freed from confinement and received into favor. His

intention was to send down these troops, in order to check the progress of

the rebels; while he himself should follow with a greater body, which

would absolutely insure success. But Surrey thought himself strong enough

to encounter alone a raw and unarmed multitude; and he succeeded in the

attempt. The rebels were dissipated; John Achamber was taken prisoner, and

afterwards executed with some of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled

to the duchess of Burgundy, who gave him protection; the greater number of

the rebels received a pardon.

 

Henry had probably expected, when he obtained this grant from parliament,

that he should be able to terminate the affair of Brittany by negotiation,

and that he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied by the

imposition. But as the distresses of the Bretons still multiplied, and

became every day more urgent, he found himself under the necessity of

taking more vigorous measures, in order to support them. On the death of

the duke, the French had revived some antiquated claims to the dominion of

the duchy; and as the duke of Orleans was now captive in France, their

former pretence for hostilities could no longer serve as a cover to their

ambition. The king resolved therefore to engage as auxiliary to Brittany;

and to consult the interests, as well as desires of his people, by

opposing himself to the progress of the French power. Besides entering

into a league with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which were

distant resources, he levied a body of troops, to the number of six

thousand men, with an intention of transporting them into Brittany.

 

1489.

 

Still anxious, however, for the repayment of his expenses, he concluded a

treaty with the young duchess, by which she engaged to deliver into his

hands two seaport towns, there to remain till she should entirely refund

the charges of the armament.[*]

 

Though he engaged for the service of these troops during the space of ten

months only, yet was the duchess obliged, by the necessity of her affairs,

to submit to such rigid conditions, imposed by any ally so much concerned

in interest to protect her. The forces arrived under the command of Lord

Willoughby of Broke; and made the Bretons, during some time, masters of

the field. The French retired into their garrisons; and expected by

dilatory measures to waste the fire of the English, and disgust them with

the enterprise. The scheme was well laid, and met with success. Lord Broke

found such discord and confusion in the counsels of Brittany, that no

measures could be concerted for any undertaking; no supply obtained; no

provisions, carriages, artillery, or military stores procured. The whole

court was rent into factions: no one minister had acquired the ascendant:

and whatever project was formed by one, was sure to be traversed by

another. The English, disconcerted in every enterprise by these

animosities and uncertain counsels, returned home as soon as the time of

their service was elapsed, leaving only a small garrison in those towns

which had been consigned into their hands. During their stay in Brittany,

they had only contributed still further to waste the country; and by their

departure, they left it entirely at the mercy of the enemy. So feeble was

the succor which Henry in this important conjuncture afforded his ally,

whom the invasion of a foreign enemy, concurring with domestic

dissensions, had reduced to the utmost distress.

 

The great object of the domestic dissensions in Brittany was the disposal

of the young duchess in marriage. The mareschal Rieux, favored by Henry,

seconded the suit of the lord D’Albret, who led some forces to her

assistance. The chancellor Montauban, observing the aversion of the

duchess to this suitor, insisted that a petty prince, such as D’Albret,

was unable to support Anne in her present extremities; and he recommended

some more powerful alliance, particularly that of Maximilian, king of the

Romans.

 

1490.

 

This party at last prevailed; the marriage with Maximilian was celebrated

by proxy; and the duchess thenceforth assumed the title of queen of the

Romans. But this magnificent appellation was all she gained by her

marriage. Maximilian, destitute of troops and money, and embarrassed with

the continual revolts of the Flemings, could send no succor to his

distressed consort; while D’Albret, enraged at the preference given to his

rival, deserted her cause, and received the French into Nantz, the most

important place in the duchy both for strength and riches.

 

The French court now began to change their scheme with regard to the

subjection of Brittany. Charles had formerly been affianced to Margaret,

daughter of Maximilian; who, though too young for the consummation of her

marriage, had been sent to Paris to be educated, and at this time bore the

title of queen of France. Besides the rich dowry which she brought the

king, she was, after her brother Philip, then in early youth, heir to all

the dominions of the house of Burgundy; and seemed in many respects the

most proper match that could be chosen for the young monarch. These

circumstances had so blinded both Maximilian and Henry, that they never

suspected any other intentions in the French court; nor were they able to

discover that engagements, seemingly so advantageous and so solemnly

entered into, could be infringed and set aside. But Charles began to

perceive that the conquest of Brittany, in opposition to the natives, and

to all the great powers of Christendom, would prove a difficult

enterprise; and that even if he should overrun the country and make

himself master of the fortresses, it would be impossible for him long to

retain possession of them. The marriage alone of the duchess could fully

reannex that fief to the crown; and the present and certain enjoyment of

so considerable a territory, seemed preferable to the prospect of

inheriting the dominions of the house of Burgundy; a prospect which became

every day more distant and precarious. Above all, the marriage of

Maximilian and Anne appeared destructive to the grandeur and even security

of the French monarchy; while that prince, possessing Flanders on the one

hand, and Brittany on the other, might thus, from both quarters, make

inroads into the heart of the country. The only remedy for these evils was

therefore concluded to be the dissolution of the two marriages, which had

been celebrated, but not consummated; and the espousal of the duchess of

Brittany by the king of France.

 

It was necessary that this expedient, which had not been foreseen by any

court in Europe, and which they were all so much interested to oppose,

should be kept a profound secret, and should be discovered to the world

only by the full execution of it. The measures of the French ministry in

the conduct of this delicate enterprise were wise and political. While

they pressed Brittany with all the rigors of war, they secretly gained the

count of Dunois, who possessed great authority with the Bretons; and

having also engaged in their interests the prince of Orange, cousin-german

to the duchess, they gave him his liberty, and sent him into Brittany.

These partisans, supported by other emissaries of France, prepared the

minds of men for the great revolution projected, and displayed, though

still with many precautions, all the advantages of a union with the French

monarchy. They represented to the barons of Brittany, that their country,

harassed during so many years with perpetual war, had need of some repose,

and of a solid and lasting peace with the only power that was formidable

to them: that their alliance with Maximilian was not able to afford them

even present protection; and, by closely uniting them to a power which was

rival to the greatness of France, fixed them in perpetual enmity with that

potent monarchy: that their vicinity exposed them first to the inroads of

the enemy; and the happiest event which, in such a situation, could befall

them, would be to attain a peace, though by a final subjection to France,

and by the loss of that liberty transmitted to them from their ancestors:

and that any other expedient, compatible with the honor of the state and

their duty to their sovereign, was preferable to a scene of such disorder

and devastation.

 

These suggestions had influence with the Bretons: but the chief difficulty

lay in surmounting the prejudices of the young duchess herself. That

princess had imbibed a strong prepossession against the French nation,

particularly against Charles, the author of all the calamities which, from

her earliest infancy, had befallen her family. She had also fixed her

affections on Maximilian; and as she now deemed him her husband, she could

not, she thought, without incurring the greatest guilt, and violating the

most solemn engagements, contract a marriage with any other person.

 

1491.

 

In order to overcome her obstinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orleans his

liberty; who, though formerly a suitor to the duchess, was now contented

to ingratiate himself with the king, by employing in his favor all the

interest which he still possessed in Brittany. Mareschal Rieux and

Chancellor Montauban were reconciled by his mediation; and these rival

ministers now concurred with the prince of Orange and the count of Dunois,

in pressing the conclusion of a marriage with Charles. By their

suggestion, Charles advanced with a powerful army, and invested Rennes, at

that time the residence of the duchess; who, assailed on all hands, and

finding none to support her in her inflexibility, at last opened the gates

of the city, and agreed to espouse the king of France, She was married at

Langey, in Touraine; conducted to St. Denis, where she was crowned; thence

made her entry into Paris, amidst the joyful acclamations of the people,

who regarded this marriage as the most prosperous event that could have

befallen the monarchy.

 

The triumph and success of Charles was the most sensible mortification to

the king of the Romans. He had lost a considerable territory, which he

thought he had acquired, and an accomplished princess, whom he had

espoused; he was affronted in the person of his daughter Margaret, who was

sent back to him, after she had been treated during some years as queen of

France; he had reason to reproach himself with his own supine security, in

neglecting the consummation of his marriage, which was easily practicable

for him, and which would have rendered the tie indissoluble: these

considerations threw him into the most violent rage, which he vented in

very indecent expressions; and he threatened France with an invasion from

the united arms of Austria, Spain, and England.

 

The king of England had also just reason to reproach himself with

misconduct in this important transaction; and though the affair had

terminated in a manner which he could not precisely foresee, his

negligence, in leaving his most useful ally so long exposed to the

invasion of superior power, could not but appear on reflection the result

of timid caution and narrow politics. As he valued himself on his

extensive foresight and profound judgment, the ascendant acquired over him

by a raw youth, such as Charles, could not but give him the highest

displeasure, and prompt him to seek vengeance, after all remedy for his

miscarriage was become absolutely impracticable. But he was further

actuated by avarice, a motive still more predominant with him than either

pride or revenge; and he sought, even from his present disappointments,

the gratification of this ruling passion. On pretence of a French war, he

issued a commission for levying a “benevolence” on his people;[*] a

species of taxation which had been abolished by a recent law of Richard

III.

 

This violence (for such it really was) fell chiefly on the commercial part

of the nation, who were possessed of the ready money. London alone

contributed to the amount of near ten thousand pounds. Archbishop Morton,

the chancellor, instructed the commissioners to employ a dilemma, in which

every one might be comprehended: if the persons applied to lived frugally,

they were told that their parsimony must necessarily have enriched them;

if their method of living were splendid and hospitable, they were

concluded to be opulent on account of their expenses. This device was by

some called Chancellor Morton’s fork, by others his crutch.

 

So little apprehensive was the king of a parliament on account of his

levying this arbitrary imposition, that he soon after summoned that

assembly to meet at Westminster; and he even expected to enrich himself

further by working on their passions and prejudices. He knew the

displeasure which the English had conceived against France on account of

the acquisition of Brittany; and he took care to insist on that topic, in

the speech which he himself pronounced to the parliament. He told them,

that France, elated with her late successes, had even proceeded to a

contempt of England, and had refused to pay the tribute which Lewis XI had

stipulated to Edward IV.: that it became so warlike a nation as the

English to be roused by this indignity, and not to limit their pretensions

merely to repelling the present injury: that, for his part, he was

determined to lay claim to the crown itself of France, and to maintain by

force of arms so just a title, transmitted to him by his gallant

ancestors: that Crecy, Poictiers, and Azincour were sufficient to instruct

them in their superiority over the enemy; nor did he despair of adding new

names to the glorious catalogue; that a king of France had been prisoner

in London, and a king of England had been crowned at Paris; events which

should animate them to an emulation of like glory with that which had been

enjoyed by their forefathers: that the domestic dissensions of England had

been the sole cause of her losing these foreign dominions; and her present

internal union would be the effectual means of recovering them: that where

such lasting honor was in view, and such an important acquisition, it

became not brave men to repine at the advance of a little treasure: and

that, for his part, he was determined to make the war maintain itself; and

hoped by the invasion of so opulent a kingdom as France, to increase

rather than diminish the riches of the nation.[*]

 

Notwithstanding these magnificent vaunts of the king, all men of

penetration concluded, from the personal character of the man, and still

more from the situation of affairs, that he had no serious intention of

pushing the war to such extremities as he pretended. France was not now in

the same condition as when such successful inroads had been made upon her

by former kings of England. The great fiefs were united to the crown; the

princes of the blood were desirous of tranquillity; the nation abounded

with able captains and veteran soldiers; and the general aspect of her

affairs seemed rather to threaten her neighbors, than to promise them any

considerable advantages against her. The levity and vain-glory of

Maximilian were supported by his pompous titles; but were ill seconded by

military power, and still less by any revenue proportioned to them. The

politic Ferdinand, while he made a show of war, was actually negotiating

for peace; and rather than expose himself to any hazard, would accept of

very moderate concessions from France. Even England was not free from

domestic discontents; and in Scotland, the death of Henry’s friend and

ally, James III., who had been murdered by his rebellious subjects, had

made way for the succession of his son, James IV., who was devoted to the

French interest, and would surely be alarmed at any important progress of

the English arms. But all these obvious considerations had no influence on

the parliament. Inflamed by the ideas of subduing France, and of enriching

themselves by the spoils of that kingdom, they gave into the snare

prepared for them, and voted the supply which the king demanded. Two

fifteenths were granted him; and the better to enable his vassals and

nobility to attend him, an act was passed, empowering them to sell their

estates, without paying any fines for alienation.

 

1492.

 

The nobility were universally seized with a desire of military glory; and

having credulously swallowed all the boasts of the king, they dreamed of

no less than carrying their triumphant banners to the gates of Paris, and

putting the crown of France on the head of their sovereign. Many of them

borrowed large sums, or sold off manors, that they might appear in the

field with greater splendor, and lead out their followers in more complete

order. The king crossed the sea, and arrived at Calais on the sixth of

October, with an army of twenty-five thousand foot and sixteen hundred

horse, which he put under the command of the duke of Bedford and the earl

of Oxford: but as some inferred, from his opening the campaign in so late

a season, that peace would soon be concluded between the crowns, he was

desirous of suggesting a contrary inference. “He had come over,” he said,

“to make an entire conquest of France, which was not the work of one

summer. It was therefore of no consequence at what season he began the

invasion; especially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters.” As if he

had seriously intended this enterprise, he instantly marched into the

enemy’s country, and laid siege to Boulogne: but notwithstanding this

appearance of hostility, there had been secret advances made towards peace

above three months before; and commissioners had been appointed to treat

of the terms. The better to reconcile the minds of men to this unexpected

measure, the king’s ambassadors arrived in the camp from the Low

Countries, and informed him, that Maximilian was in no readiness to join

him; nor was any assistance to be expected from that quarter. Soon after,

messengers came from Spain, and brought news of a peace concluded between

that kingdom and France, in which Charles had made a cession of the

counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand. Though these articles of

intelligence were carefully dispersed throughout the army, the king was

still apprehensive lest a sudden peace, after such magnificent promises

and high expectations, might expose him to reproach. In order the more

effectually to cover the intended measures, he secretly engaged the

marquis of Dorset, together with twenty-three persons of distinction, to

present him a petition for agreeing to a treaty with France. The pretence

was founded on the late season of the year, the difficulty of supplying

the army at Calais during winter, the obstacles which arose in the siege

of Boulogne, the desertion of those allies whose assistance had been most

relied on: events which might, all of them, have been foreseen before the

embarkation of the forces.

 

In consequence of these preparatory steps, the bishop of Exeter and Lord

Daubeney were sent to confer at Estaples with the mareschal de Cordes, and

to put the last hand to the treaty. A few days sufficed for that purpose:

the demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the king of Franco, who

deemed the peaceable possession of Brittany an equivalent for any sum, and

who was all on fire for his projected expedition into Italy, readily

agreed to the proposals made him. He engaged to pay Henry seven hundred

and forty-five thousand crowns, near four hundred thousand pounds sterling

of our present money; partly as a reimbursement of the sums advanced to

Brittany, partly as arrears of the pension due to Edward IV. And he

stipulated a yearly pension to Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thousand

crowns. Thus the king, as remarked by his historian, made profit upon his

subjects for the war, and upon his enemies for the peace.[*] And the

people agreed that he had fulfilled his promise, when he said to the

parliament that he would make the war maintain itself. Maximilian was, if

he pleased, comprehended in Henry’s treaty; but he disdained to be in any

respect beholden to an ally, of whom, he thought, he had reason to

complain: he made a separate peace with France, and obtained restitution

of Artois, Franche Compte, and Charolois, which had been ceded as the

dowry of his daughter when she was affianced to the king of France.

 

The peace concluded between England and France was the more likely to

continue, because Charles, full of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all

his attention to the side of Italy, and soon after undertook the conquest

of Naples; an enterprise which Henry regarded with the greater

indifference, as Naples lay remote from him, and France had never, in any

age, been successful in that quarter. The king’s authority was fully

established at home; and every rebellion which had been attempted against

him, had hitherto tended only to confound his enemies, and consolidate his

power and influence. His reputation for policy and conduct was daily

augmenting; his treasures had increased even from the most unfavorable

events; the hopes of all pretenders to his throne were cut off, as well by

his marriage as by the issue which it had brought him. In this prosperous

situation, the king had reason to flatter himself with the prospect of

durable peace and tranquillity; but his inveterate and indefatigable

enemies, whom he had wantonly provoked, raised him an adversary, who long

kept him in inquietude, and sometimes even brought him into danger.

 

The duchess of Burgundy, full of resentment for the depression of her

family and its partisans, rather irritated than discouraged by the ill

success of her past enterprises, was determined at least to disturb that

government which she found it so difficult to subvert. By means of her

emissaries, she propagated a report that her nephew, Richard Plantagenet,

duke of York, had escaped from the Tower when his elder brother was

murdered, and that he still lay somewhere concealed: and finding this

rumor, however improbable, to be greedily received by the people, she had

been looking out for some young man proper to personate that unfortunate

prince.

 

There was one Osbec, or Warbec, a renegade Jew of Tournay, who had been

carried by some business to London in the reign of Edward IV., and had

there a son born to him. Having had opportunities of being known to the

king, and obtaining his favor, he prevailed with that prince, whose

manners were very affable, to stand godfather to his son, to whom he gave

the name of Peter, corrupted, after the Flemish manner, into Peterkin, or

Perkin. It was by some believed that Edward, among his amorous adventures,

had a secret commerce with Warbec’s wife; and people thence accounted for

that resemblance which was afterwards remarked between young Perkin and

that monarch.[*]

 

Some years after the birth of this child, Warbec returned to Tournay;

where Perkin, his son, did not long remain, but by different accidents,

was carried from place to place, and his birth and fortunes became thereby

unknown, and difficult to be traced by the most diligent inquiry. The

variety of his adventures had happily favored the natural versatility and

sagacity of his genius; and he seemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to

act any part, or assume any character. In this light he had been

represented to the duchess of Burgundy, who, struck with the concurrence

of so many circumstances suited to her purpose, desired to be made

acquainted with the man, on whom she already began to ground her hopes of

success. She found him to exceed her most sanguine expectations; so comely

did he appear in his person, so graceful in his air, so courtly in his

address, so full of docility and good sense in his behavior and

conversation. The lessons necessary to be taught him, in order to his

personating the duke of York, were soon learned by a youth of such quick

apprehension; but as the season seemed not then favorable for their

enterprise, Margaret, in order the better to conceal him, sent him, under

the care of Lady Brampton into Portugal, where he remained a year unknown

to all the world.

 

The war, which was then ready to break out between France and England,

seemed to afford a proper opportunity for the discovery of this new

phenomenon; and Ireland, which still retained its attachments to the house

of York, was chosen as the proper place for his first appearance.[*] He

landed at Cork; and immediately assuming the name of Richard Plantagenet,

drew to him partisans among that credulous people. He wrote letters to the

earls of Desmond and Kildare, inviting them to join his party: he

dispersed every where the strange intelligence of his escape from the

cruelty of his uncle Richard: and men, fond of every thing new and

wonderful, began to make him the general subject of their discourse, and

even the object of their favor.

 

The news soon reached France; and Charles, prompted by the secret

solicitations of the duchess of Burgundy, and the intrigues of one Frion,

a secretary of Henry’s, who had deserted his service, sent Perkin an

invitation to repair to him at Paris. He received him with all the marks

of regard due to the duke of York; settled on him a handsome pension,

assigned him magnificent lodgings, and in order to provide at once for his

dignity and security, gave him a guard for his person, of which Lord

Congresal accepted the office of captain. The French courtiers readily

embraced a fiction which their sovereign thought it his interest to adopt:

Perkin, both by his deportment and personal qualities, supported the

prepossession which was spread abroad of his royal pedigree: and the whole

kingdom was full of the accomplishments, as well as the singular

adventures and misfortunes, of the young Plantagenet. Wonders of this

nature are commonly augmented at a distance. From France the admiration

and credulity diffused themselves into England: Sir George Nevil,[*] Sir

John Taylor, and above a hundred gentlemen more, came to Paris, in order

to offer their services to the supposed duke of York, and to share his

fortunes: and the impostor had now the appearance of a court attending

him, and began to entertain hopes of final success in his undertakings.

 

When peace was concluded between France and England at Estaples, Henry

applied to have Perkin put into his hands; but Charles, resolute not to

betray a young man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited into his

kingdom, would agree only to dismiss him. The pretended Richard retired to

the duchess of Burgundy, and craving her protection and assistance,

offered to lay before her all the proofs of that birth to which he laid

claim. The princess affected ignorance of his pretensions; even put on the

appearance of distrust: and having, as she said, been already deceived by

Simnel, she was determined never again to be seduced by any impostor. She

desired before all the world to be instructed in his reasons for assuming

the name which he bore; seemed to examine every circumstance with the most

scrupulous nicety; put many particular questions to him; affected

astonishment at his answers; and at last, after long and severe scrutiny,

burst out into joy and admiration at his wonderful deliverance, embraced

him as her nephew, the true image of Edward, the sole heir of the

Plantagenets, and the legitimate successor to the English throne.

 

1493.

 

She immediately assigned him an equipage suited to his pretended birth;

appointed him a guard of thirty halberdiers; engaged every one to pay

court to him; and on all occasions honored him with the appellation of the

White Rose of England. The Flemings, moved by the authority which

Margaret, both from her rank and personal character, enjoyed among them,

readily adopted the fiction of Perkin’s royal descent: no surmise of his

true birth was as yet heard of little contradiction was made to the

prevailing opinion: and the English, from their great communication with

the Low Countries, were every day more and more prepossessed in favor of

the impostor.

 

It was not the populace alone of England that gave credit to Perkin’s

pretensions. Men of the highest birth and quality, disgusted at Henry’s

government, by which they found the nobility depressed, began to turn

their eyes towards the new claimant; and some of them even entered into a

correspondence with him. Lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas

Thwaites, betrayed their inclination towards him: Sir William Stanley

himself, lord chamberlain, who had been so active in raising Henry to the

throne, moved either by blind credulity or a restless ambition,

entertained the project of a revolt in favor of his enemy.[*]

 

Sir Robert Clifford and William Barley were still more open in their

measures: they went over to Flanders, were introduced by the duchess of

Burgundy to the acquaintance of Perkin, and made him a tender of their

services. Clifford wrote back to England, that he knew perfectly the

person of Richard, duke of York, that this young man was undoubtedly that

prince himself, and that no circumstance of his story was exposed to the

least difficulty. Such positive intelligence, conveyed by a person of rank

and character, was sufficient with many to put the matter beyond question,

and excited the attention and wonder even of the most indifferent. The

whole nation was held in suspense; a regular conspiracy was formed against

the king’s authority, and a correspondence settled between the

malecontents in Flanders and those in England.

 

The king was informed of all these particulars; but agreeably to his

character, which was both cautious and resolute, he proceeded

deliberately, though steadily, in counterworking the projects of his

enemies. His first object was to ascertain the death of the real duke of

York, and to confirm the opinion that had always prevailed with regard to

that event. Five persons had been employed by Richard in the murder of his

nephews, or could give evidence with regard to it; Sir James Tyrrel, to

whom he had committed the government of the Tower for that purpose, and

who had seen the dead princes; Forrest, Dighton, and Slater, who

perpetrated the crime; and the priest who buried the bodies. Tyrrel and

Dighton alone were alive, and they agreed in the same story; but as the

priest was dead, and as the bodies were supposed to have been removed by

Richard’s orders from the place where they were first interred, and could

not now be found, it was not in Henry’s power to put the fact, so much as

he wished, beyond all doubt and controversy.

 

He met at first with more difficulty, but was in the end more successful,

in detecting who this wonderful person was that thus boldly advanced

pretensions to his crown. He dispersed his spies all over Flanders and

England; he engaged many to pretend that they had embraced Perkin’s party;

he directed them to insinuate themselves into the confidence of the young

man’s friends; in proportion as they conveyed intelligence of any

conspirator, he bribed his retainers, his domestic servants, nay,

sometimes his confessor, and by these means traced up some other

confederate; Clifford himself he engaged, by the hope of rewards and

pardon, to betray the secrets committed to him; the more trust he gave to

any of his spies, the higher resentment did he feign against them, some of

them he even caused to be publicly anathematized, in order the better to

procure them the confidence of his enemies: and in the issue, the whole

plan of the conspiracy was clearly laid before him; and the pedigree,

adventures, life, and conversation of the pretended duke of York. This

latter part of the story was immediately published for the satisfaction of

the nation: the conspirators he reserved for a slower and surer vengeance.

 

1494.

 

Meanwhile he remonstrated with the archduke Philip, on account of the

countenance and protection which was afforded in his dominions to so

infamous an impostor; contrary to treaties subsisting between the

sovereigns, and to the mutual amity which had so long been maintained by

the subjects of both states. Margaret had interest enough to get his

application rejected; on pretence that Philip had no authority over the

demesnes of the duchess dowager. And the king, in resentment of this

injury, cut off all commerce with the Low Countries, banished the

Flemings, and recalled his own subjects from these provinces. Philip

retaliated by like edicts; but Henry knew, that so mutinous a people as

the Flemings would not long bear, in compliance with the humors of their

prince, to be deprived of the beneficial branch of commerce which they

carried on with England.

 

He had it in his power to inflict more effectual punishment on his

domestic enemies; and when his projects were sufficiently matured, he

failed not to make them feel the effects of his resentment. Almost in the

same instant he arrested Fitzwater, Mountfort, and Thwaites, together with

William Daubeney, Robert Rateliff, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood.

All these were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high treason, in

adhering and promising aid to Perkin. Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney

were immediately executed: Fitzwater was sent over to Calais, and detained

in custody; but being detected in practising on his keeper for an escape,

he soon after underwent the same fate. The rest were pardoned, together

with William Worseley, dean of St. Paul’s, and some others, who had been

accused and examined, but not brought to public trial.[*]

 

Greater and more solemn preparations were deemed requisite for the trial

of Stanley, lord chamberlain, whose authority in the nation, whose

domestic connections with the king, as well as his former services, seemed

to secure him against any accusation or punishment. Clifford was directed

to come over privately to England, and to throw himself at the king’s feet

while he sat in council; craving pardon for past offences and offering to

atone for them by any services which should be required of him. Henry then

told him, that the best proof he could give of penitence, and the only

service he could now render him, was the full confession of his guilt, and

the discovery of all his accomplices, however distinguished by rank or

character. Encouraged by this exhortation, Clifford accused Stanley, then

present, as his chief abettor; and offered to lay before the council the

full proof of his guilt. Stanley himself could not discover more surprise

than was affected by Henry on the occasion. He received the intelligence

as absolutely false and incredible; that a man, to whom he was in a great

measure beholden for his crown, and even for his life; a man, to, whom, by

every honor and favor, he had endeavored to express his gratitude; whose

brother, the earl of Derby, was his own father-in-law; to whom he had even

committed the trust of his person, by creating him lord chamberlain: that

this man, enjoying his full confidence and affection, not actuated by any

motive of discontent or apprehension, should engage in a conspiracy

against him. Clifford was therefore exhorted to weigh well the

consequences of his accusation; but as he persisted in the same positive

asseverations, Stanley was committed to custody, and was soon after

examined before the council.[*] He denied not the guilt imputed to him by

Clifford; he did not even endeavor much to extenuate it; whether he

thought that a frank and open confession would serve as an atonement, or

trusted to his present connections and his former services for pardon and

security. But princes are often apt to regard great services as a ground

of jealousy, especially if accompanied with a craving and restless

disposition in the person who has performed them. The general discontent

also, and mutinous humor of the people, seemed to require some great

example of severity. And as Stanley was one of the most opulent subjects

in the kingdom, being possessed of above three thousand pounds a year in

land, and forty thousand marks in plate and money, besides other property

of great value, the prospect of so rich a forfeiture was deemed no small

motive for Henry’s proceeding to extremities against him.

 

1495.

 

After six weeks’ delay, which was interposed in order to show that the

king was restrained by doubts and scruples, the prisoner was brought to

his trial, condemned, and presently after beheaded. Historians are not

agreed with regard to the crime which was proved against him. The general

report is, that he should have said in confidence to Clifford, that if he

were sure the young man who appeared in Flanders was really son to King

Edward, he never would bear arms against him. The sentiment might disgust

Henry, as implying a preference of the house of York to that of Lancaster;

but could scarcely be the ground, even in those arbitrary times, of a

sentence of high treason against Stanley. It is more probable, therefore,

as is asserted by some historians, that he had expressly engaged to assist

Perkin, and had actually sent him some supply of money.

 

The fate of Stanley made great impression on the kingdom, and struck all

the partisans of Perkin with the deepest dismay. From Clifford’s

desertion, they found that all their secrets were betrayed; and as it

appeared that Stanley, while he seemed to live in the greatest confidence

with the king, had been continually surrounded by spies, who reported and

registered every action in which he was engaged, nay, every word which

fell from him, a general distrust took place, and all mutual confidence

was destroyed, even among intimate friends and acquaintance. The jealous

and severe temper of the king, together with his great reputation for

sagacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled not only the

movements of sedition, but the very murmurs of faction. Libels, however,

crept out against Henry’s person and administration; and being greedily

propagated by every secret art, showed that there still remained among the

people a considerable root of discontent, which wanted only a proper

opportunity to discover itself.

 

But Henry continued more intent on increasing the terrors of his people,

than on gaining their affections. Trusting to the great success which

attended him in all his enterprises, he gave every day more and more a

loose to his rapacious temper, and employed the arts of perverted law and

justice, in order to exact fines and compositions from his people. Sir

William Capel, alderman of London, was condemned on some penal statutes to

pay the sum of two thousand seven hundred and forty-three pounds, and was

obliged to compound for sixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the first

noted case of the kind; but it became a precedent, which prepared the may

for many others. The management, indeed, of these arts of chicanery, was

the great secret of the king’s administration. While he depressed the

nobility, he exalted, and honored, and caressed the lawyers; and by that

means both bestowed authority on the laws, and was enabled, whenever he

pleased, to pervert them to his own advantage. His government was

oppressive; but it was so much the less burdensome, as, by his extending

royal authority, and curbing the nobles, he became in reality the sole

oppressor in his kingdom.

 

As Perkin found that the king’s authority daily gained ground among the

people, and that his own pretensions were becoming obsolete, he resolved

to attempt something which might revive the hopes and expectations of his

partisans. Having collected a band of outlaws, pirates, robbers, and

necessitous persons of all nations, to the number of six hundred men, he

put to sea, with a resolution of making a descent in England, and of

exciting the common people to arms, since all his correspondence with the

nobility was cut off by Henry vigilance and severity. Information being

brought him that the king had made a progress to the north, he cast anchor

on the coast of Kent, and sent some of his retainers ashore, who invited

the country to join him. The gentlemen of Kent assembled some troops to

oppose him; but they purposed to do more essential service than by

repelling the invasion: they carried the semblance of friendship to

Perkin, and invited him to come himself ashore, in order to take the

command over them. But the wary youth, observing that they had more order

and regularity in their movements than could be supposed in new levied

forces who had taken arms against established authority, refused to

intrust himself into their hands; and the Kentish troops, despairing of

success in their stratagem, fell upon such of his retainers as were

already landed; and besides some whom they slew, they took a hundred and

fifty prisoners. These were tried and condemned and all of them executed,

by orders from the king, who was resolved to use no lenity towards men of

such desperate fortunes.[*]

 

This year a parliament was summoned in England, and another in Ireland;

and some remarkable laws were passed in both countries. The English

parliament enacted, that no person who should by arms, or otherwise assist

the king for the time being, should ever afterwards, either by course of

law or act of parliament, be attainted for such an instance of obedience.

This statute might be exposed to some censure, as favorable to usurpers;

were there any precise rule, which always, even during the most factious

times, could determine the true successor, and render every one

inexcusable who did not submit to him. But as the titles of princes are

then the great subject of dispute, and each party pleads topics in its own

favor, it seems but equitable to secure those who act in support of public

tranquillity, an object at all times of undoubted benefit and importance.

Henry, conscious of his disputed title, promoted this law, in order to

secure his partisans against all events; but as he had himself observed a

contrary practice with regard to Richard’s adherents, he had reason to

apprehend that, during the violence which usually ensues on public

convulsions, his example, rather than his law, would, in case of a new

revolution, be followed by his enemies. And the attempt to bind the

legislature itself, by prescribing rules to future parliaments, was

contradictory to the plainest principles of political government.

 

This parliament also passed an act, empowering the king to levy, by course

of law, all the sums which any person had agreed to pay by way of

benevolence; a statute by which that arbitrary method of taxation was

indirectly authorized and justified.

 

The king’s authority appeared equally prevalent and uncontrolled in

Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had been sent over to that country, with an

intention of quelling the partisans of the house of York, and of reducing

the natives to subjection. He was not supported by forces sufficient for

that enterprise: the Irish, by flying into their woods, and morasses, and

mountains, for some time eluded his efforts; but Poynings summoned a

parliament at Dublin, where he was more successful. He passed that

memorable statute, which still bears his name, and which establishes the

authority of the English government in Ireland. By this statute, all the

former laws of England were made to be of force in Ireland; and no bill

can be introduced into the Irish parliament, unless it previously receive

the sanction of the council of England. This latter clause seems

calculated for insuring the dominion of the English; but was really

granted at the desire of the Irish commons who intended, by that means, to

secure themselves from the tyranny of their lords, particularly of such

lieutenants or deputies as were of Irish birth.[*]

 

While Henry’s authority was thus established throughout his dominions, and

general tranquillity prevailed, the whole continent was thrown into

combustion by the French invasion of Italy, and by the rapid success which

attended Charles in that rash and ill-concerted enterprise. The Italians,

who had entirely lost the use of arms, and who, in the midst of continual

wars, had become every day more unwarlike, were astonished to meet an

enemy that made the field of battle, not a pompous tournament, but a scene

of blood, and sought, at the hazard of their own lives, the death of their

enemy. Their effeminate troops were dispersed every where on the approach

of the French army: their best fortified cities opened their gates:

kingdoms and states were in an instant overturned; and through the whole

length of Italy, which the French penetrated without resistance, they

seemed rather to be taking quarters in their own country, than making

conquests over an enemy. The maxims which the Italians during that age

followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to support their states,

as the habits to which they were addicted in war: a treacherous,

deceitful, and inconsistent system of politics prevailed; and even those

small remains of fidelity and honor, which were preserved in the councils

of the other European princes, were ridiculed in Italy, as proofs of

ignorance and rusticity. Ludovico, duke of Milan, who invited the French

to invade Naples, had never desired or expected their success; and was the

first that felt terror from the prosperous issue of those projects which

he himself had concerted. By his intrigues, a league was formed among

several potentates, to oppose the progress of Charles’s conquests, and

secure their own independency. This league was composed of Ludovico

himself, the pope, Maximilian, king of the Romans, Ferdinand of Spain, and

the republic of Venice. Henry too entered into the confederacy; but was

not put to any expense or trouble in consequence of his engagements. The

king of France, terrified by so powerful a combination, retired from

Naples with the greater part of his army, and returned to France. The

forces which he left in his new conquest were, partly by the revolt of the

inhabitants, partly by the invasion of the Spaniards, soon after subdued;

and the whole kingdom of Naples suddenly returned to its allegiance under

Ferdinand, son to Alphonso, who had been suddenly expelled by the

irruption of the French. Ferdinand died soon after, and left his uncle

Frederick in full possession of the throne
