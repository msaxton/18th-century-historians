There now opens to us a new scene. Charles naturally disgusted with

parliaments, who, he found, were determined to proceed against him with

unmitigated rigor, both in invading his prerogative and refusing him all

supply, resolved not to call any more, till he should see greater

indications of a compliant disposition in the nation. Having lost his

great favorite, Buckingham, he became his own minister and never

afterwards reposed in any one such unlimited confidence. As he chiefly

follows his own genius and disposition, his measures are henceforth less

rash and hasty; though the general tenor of his administration still wants

somewhat of being entirely legal, and perhaps more of being entirely

prudent.

 

We shall endeavor to exhibit a just idea of the events which followed for

some years, so far as they regard foreign affairs, the state of the court,

and the government of the nation. The incidents are neither numerous nor

illustrious; but the knowledge of them is necessary for understanding the

subsequent transactions which are so memorable.

 

Charles, destitute of all supply, was necessarily reduced to embrace a

measure which ought to have been the result of reason and sound policy: he

made peace with the two crowns against which he had hitherto waged a war,

entered into without necessity, and conducted without glory.

Notwithstanding the distracted and helpless condition of England, no

attempt was made either by France or Spain to invade their enemy nor did

they entertain any further project than to defend themselves against the

feeble and ill-concerted expeditions of that kingdom. Pleased that the

jealousies and quarrels, between king and parliament had disarmed so

formidable a power, they carefully avoided any enterprise which might

rouse either the terror or anger of the English, and dispose them to

domestic union and submission. The endeavors to regain the good will of

the nation were carried so far by the king of Spain, that he generously

released and sent home all the English prisoners taken in the expedition

against Cadiz. The example was imitated by France after the retreat of the

English from the Isle of RhÃ©. When princes were in such dispositions, and

had so few pretensions on each other, it could not be difficult to

conclude a peace. The treaty was first signed with France.[*] The

situation of the king’s affairs did not entitle him to demand any

conditions for the Hugonots, and they were abandoned to the will of their

sovereign.

 

1630.

 

Peace was afterwards concluded with Spain, where no conditions were made

in favor of the palatine, except that Spain promised in general to use

their good offices for his restoration.[**] The influence of these two

wars on domestic affairs, and on the dispositions of king and people, was

of the utmost consequence; but no alteration was made by them on the

foreign interests of the kingdom.

 

Nothing more happy can be imagined than the situation in which England

then stood with regard to foreign affairs. Europe was divided between the

rival families of Bourbon and Austria, whose opposite interests, and still

more, their mutual jealousies, secured the tranquillity of this island.

Their forces were so nearly counterpoised, that no apprehensions were

entertained of any event which could suddenly disturb the balance of power

between them. The Spanish monarch, deemed the most powerful, lay at

greatest distance; and the English, by that means, possessed the advantage

of being engaged by political motives into a more intimate union and

confederacy with the neighboring potentate. The dispersed situation of the

Spanish dominions rendered the naval power of England formidable to them,

and kept that empire in continual dependence. France, more vigorous and

more compact, was every day rising in policy and discipline; and reached

at last an equality of power with the house of Austria; but her progress,

slow and gradual, left it still in the power of England, by a timely

interposition, to check her superiority. And thus Charles, could he have

avoided all dissensions with his own subjects, was in a situation to make

himself be courted and respected by every power in Europe; and, what has

scarcely ever since been attained by the princes of this island, he could

either be active with dignity, or neutral with security.

 

A neutrality was embraced by the king; and during the rest of his reign,

he seems to have little regarded foreign affairs, except so far as he was

engaged by honor and by friendship for his sister and the palatine, to

endeavor the procuring of some relief for that unhappy family. He joined

his good offices to those of France, and mediated a peace between the

kings of Sweden and Poland, in hopes of engaging the former to embrace the

protection of the oppressed Protestants in the empire. This was the famed

Gustavus, whose heroic genius, seconded by the wisest policy, made him in

a little time the most distinguished monarch of the age, and rendered his

country, formerly unknown and neglected, of great weight in the balance of

Europe. To encourage and assist him in his projected invasion of Germany,

Charles agreed to furnish him with six thousand men; but, that he might

preserve the appearance of neutrality, he made use of the marquis of

Hamilton’s name.[*]

 

That nobleman entered into an engagement with Gustavus; and enlisting

these troops in England and Scotland, at Charles’s expense, he landed them

in the Elbe. The decisive battle of Leipsic was fought soon after, where

the conduct of Tilly and the valor of the imperialists were overcome by

the superior conduct of Gustavus and the superior valor of the Swedes.

What remained of this hero’s life was one continued series of victory, for

which he was less beholden to fortune than to those personal endowments

which he derived from nature and from industry. That rapid progress of

conquest which we so much admire in ancient history, was here renewed in

modern annals; and without that cause to which, in former ages, it had

ever been owing. Military nations were not now engaged against an

undisciplined and unwarlike people; nor heroes set in opposition to

cowards. The veteran troops of Ferdinand, conducted by the most celebrated

generals of the age, were foiled in every encounter; and all Germany was

overrun in an instant by the victorious Swede. But by this extraordinary

and unexpected success of his ally, Charles failed of the purpose for

which he framed the alliance. Gustavus, elated by prosperity, began to

form more extensive plans of ambition; and in freeing Germany from the

yoke of Ferdinand, he intended to reduce it to subjection under his own.

He refused to restore the palatine to his principality, except on

conditions which would have kept him in total dependence.[*] And thus the

negotiation was protracted, till the battle of Lutzen, where the Swedish

monarch perished in the midst of a complete victory which he obtained over

his enemies.

 

We have carried on these transactions a few years beyond the present

period, that we might not be obliged to return to them, nor be henceforth

interrupted in our account of Charles’s court and kingdoms.

 

After the death of Buckingham, who had somewhat alienated Charles from the

queen, she is to be considered as his chief friend and favorite. That

rustic contempt of the fair sex which James affected, and which, banishing

them from his court, made it resemble more a fair or an exchange than the

seat of a great prince, was very wide of the disposition of this monarch.

But though full of complaisance to the whole sex, Charles reserved all his

passion for his consort, to whom he attached himself with unshaken

fidelity and confidence. By her sense and spirit, as well as by her

beauty, she justified the fondness of her husband; though it is allowed

that, being somewhat of a passionate temper, she precipitated him into

hasty and imprudent measures. Her religion likewise, to which she was much

addicted, must be regarded as a great misfortune; since it augmented the

jealousy which prevailed against the court, and engaged her to procure for

the Catholics some indulgences which were generally distasteful to the

nation.[*]

 

In the former situation of the English government, when the sovereign was

in a great measure independent of his subjects, the king chose his

ministers either from personal favor, or from an opinion of their

abilities, without any regard to their parliamentary interest or talents.

It has since been the maxim of princes, wherever popular leaders encroach

too much on royal authority, to confer offices on them, in expectation

that they will afterwards become more careful not to diminish that power

which has become their own. These politics were now embraced by Charles; a

sure proof that a secret revolution had happened in the constitution, and

had necessitated the prince to adopt new maxims of government.[**]

 

But the views of the king were at this time so repugnant to those of the

Puritans, that the leaders whom he gained, lost from that moment all

interest with their party, and were even pursued as traitors with

implacable hatred and resentment. This was the case with Sir Thomas

Wentworth, whom the king created, first a baron, then a viscount, and

afterwards earl of Strafford; made him president of the council of York,

and deputy of Ireland; and regarded him as his chief minister and

counsellor. By his eminent talents and abilities, Strafford merited all

the confidence which his master reposed in him: his character was stately

and austere; more fitted to procure esteem than love: his fidelity to the

king was unshaken; but as he now employed all his counsels to support the

prerogative, which he had formerly bent all his endeavors to diminish his

virtue seems not to have been entirely pure, but to have been susceptible

of strong impressions from private interest and ambition. Sir Dudley

Digges was about the same time created master of the rolls; Noy,

attorney-general; Littleton, solicitor-general. All these had likewise

been parliamentary leaders, and were men eminent in their profession.[*]

 

 ENLARGE
 

In all ecclesiastical affairs, and even in many civil, Laud, bishop of

London, had great influence over the king. This man was virtuous, if

severity of manners alone, and abstinence from pleasure, could deserve

that name. He was learned, if polemical knowledge could entitle him to

that praise. He was disinterested; but with unceasing industry he studied

to exalt the priestly and prelatical character, which was his own. His

zeal was unrelenting in the cause of religion; that is, in imposing by

rigorous measures his own tenets and pious ceremonies on the obstinate

Puritans, who had profanely dared to oppose him. In prosecution of his

holy purposes, he overlooked every human consideration; or, in other

words, the heat and indiscretion of his temper made him neglect the views

of prudence and rules of good manners. He was in this respect happy, that

all his enemies were also imagined by him the declared enemies to loyalty

and true piety, and that every exercise of his anger by that means became

in his eyes a merit and a virtue. This was the man who acquired so great

an ascendant over Charles, and who led him, by the facility of his temper,

into a conduct which proved so fatal to himself and to his kingdoms.

 

The humor of the nation ran at that time into the extreme opposite to

superstition; and it was with difficulty that the ancient ceremonies to

which men had been accustomed, and which had been sanctified by the

practice of the first reformers, could be retained in divine service: yet

was this the time which Laud chose for the introduction of new ceremonies

and observances. Besides that these were sure to displease as innovations,

there lay, in the opinion of the public, another very forcible objection

against them. Laud, and the other prelates who embraced his measures, were

generally well instructed in sacred antiquity, and had adopted many of

those religious sentiments which prevailed during the fourth and fifth

centuries; when the Christian church, as is well known, was already sunk

into those superstitions which were afterwards continued and augmented by

the policy of Rome. The revival, therefore, of the ideas and practices of

that age, could not fail of giving the English faith and liturgy some

resemblance to the Catholic superstition, which the kingdom in general,

and the Puritans in particular, held in the greatest horror and

detestation. Men also were apt to think, that, without some secret

purpose, such insignificant observances would not be imposed with such

unrelenting zeal on the refractory nation; and that Laud’s scheme was, to

lead back the English by gradual steps to the religion of their ancestors.

They considered not, that the very insignificancy of these ceremonies

recommended them to the superstitious prelate, and made them appear the

more peculiarly sacred and religious, as they could serve to no other

purpose. Nor was the resemblance to the Romish ritual any objection, but

rather a merit with Laud and his brethren; who bore a much greater

kindness to the mother church, as they called her, than to the sectaries

and Presbyterians, and frequently recommended her as a true Christian

church; an appellation which they refused, or at least scrupled to give to

the others.[*] So openly were these tenets espoused, that not only the

discontented Puritans believed the church of England to be relapsing fast

into Romish superstition: the court of Rome itself entertained hopes of

regaining its authority in this island; and, in order to forward Laud’s

supposed good intentions, an offer was twice made him in private of a

cardinal’s hat, which he declined accepting.[**] His answer was, as he

says himself, “That something dwelt within him, which would not suffer his

compliance, till Rome were other than it is.”[***]

 

A court lady, daughter of the earl of Devonshire, having turned Catholic,

was asked by Laud the reason of her conversion: “‘Tis chiefly,” said she,

“because I hate to travel in a crowd.” The meaning of this expression

being demanded, she replied, “I perceive your grace and many others are

making haste to Rome; and therefore, in order to prevent my being crowded,

I have gone before you.” It must be confessed, that though Laud deserved

not the appellation of Papist, the genius of his religion was, though in a

less degree, the same with that of the Romish: the same profound respect

was exacted to the sacerdotal character, the same submission required to

the creeds and decrees of synods and councils; the same pomp and ceremony

was affected in worship; and the same superstitious regard to days,

postures, meats, and vestments. No wonder, therefore, that this prelate

was every where among the Puritans regarded with horror, as the forerunner

of Antichrist.

 

As a specimen of the new ceremonies to which Laud sacrificed his own quiet

and that of the nation, it may not be amiss to relate those which he was

accused of employing in the consecration of St. Catharine’s church, and

which were the object of such general scandal and offence.

 

On the bishop’s approach to the west door of the church, a loud voice

cried, “Open, open, ye everlasting doors, that the king of glory may enter

in!” Immediately the doors of the church flew open, and the bishop

entered. Falling upon his knees, with eyes elevated and arms expanded, he

uttered these words: “This place is holy; the ground is holy: in the name

of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce it holy.”

 

Going towards the chancel, he several times took up from the floor some of

the dust, and threw it in the air. When he approached, with his

attendants, near to the communion table, he bowed frequently towards it;

and on their return, they went round the church, repeating, as they

marched along, some of the psalms; and then said a form of prayer, which

concluded with these words: “We consecrate this church, and separate it

unto thee as holy ground, not to be profaned any more to common uses.”

 

After this, the bishop, standing near the communion table solemnly

pronounced many imprecations upon such as should afterwards pollute that

holy place by musters of soldiers, or keeping in it profane law-courts, or

carrying burdens through it. On the conclusion of every curse, he bowed

towards the east, and cried, “Let all the people say, Amen.”

 

The imprecations being all so piously finished, there were poured out a

number of blessings upon such as had any hand in framing and building that

sacred and beautiful edifice, and on such as had given, or should

hereafter give to it, any chalices, plate, ornaments, or utensils. At

every benediction he in like manner bowed towards the east, and cried,

“Let all the people say, Amen.”

 

The sermon followed; after which the bishop consecrated and administered

the sacrament in the following manner.

 

As he approached the communion table, he made many lowly reverences; and

coming up to that part of the table where the bread and wine lay, he bowed

seven times. After the reading of many prayers, he approached the

sacramental elements, and gently lifted up the corner of the napkin in

which the bread was placed. When he beheld the bread, he suddenly let fall

the napkin, flew back a step or two, bowed three several times towards the

bread; then he drew nigh again, opened the napkin, and bowed as before.

 

Next he laid his hand on the cup, which had a cover upon it, and was

filled with wine. He let go the cup, fell back, and bowed thrice towards

it. He approached again; and lifting op the cover, peeped into the cup.

Seeing the wine, he let fall the cover, started back, and bowed as before.

Then he received the sacrament, and gave it to others. And many prayers

being said, the solemnity of the consecration ended. The walls, and floor,

and roof of the fabric were then supposed to be sufficiently holy.[*]

 

Orders were given, and rigorously insisted on, that the communion table

should be removed from the middle of the area where it hitherto stood in

all churches, except in cathedrals.[**] It was placed at the east end,

railed in, and denominated an “altar;” as the clergyman who officiated

received commonly the appellation of “priest.” It is not easy to imagine

the discontents excited by this innovation, and the suspicions which it

gave rise to.

 

The kneeling at the altar, and the using of copes, a species of

embroidered vestment, in administering the sacrament, were also known to

be great objects of scandal, as being Popish practices; but the opposition

rather increased than abated the zeal of the prelate for the introduction

of these habits and ceremonies.

 

All kinds of ornament, especially pictures, were necessary for supporting

that mechanical devotion which was purposed to be raised in this model of

religion: but as these had been so much employed by the church of Rome,

and had given rise to so much superstition, or what the Puritans called

idolatry it was impossible to introduce them into English churches without

exciting general murmurs and complaints. But Laud possessed of present

authority, persisted in his purpose, and made several attempts towards

acquiring these ornaments. Some of the pictures introduced by him were

also found, upon inquiry, to be the very same that might be met with in

the mass-book. The crucifix too, that eternal consolation of all pious

Catholics, and terror to all sound Protestants, was not forgotten on this

occasion.[*]

 

It was much remarked, that Sheffield, the recorder of Salisbury, was tried

in the star chamber, for having broken, contrary to the bishop of

Salisbury’s express injunctions, a painted window of St. Edmond’s church

in that city. He boasted that he had destroyed these monuments of

idolatry: but for this effort of his zeal, he was fined five hundred

pounds, removed from his office, condemned to make a public

acknowledgment, and be bound to his good behavior.[**]

 

Not only such of the clergy as neglected to observe every ceremony were

suspended and deprived by the high commission court: oaths were, by many

of the bishops, imposed or the churchwardens; and they were sworn to

inform against any one who acted contrary to the ecclesiastical

canons.[***] Such a measure, though practised during the reign of

Elizabeth, gave much offence, as resembling too nearly the practice of the

Romish inquisition.

 

To show the greater alienation from the churches reformed after the

Presbyterian model, Laud advised that the discipline and worship of the

church should be imposed on the English regiments and trading companies

abroad.[****] All foreigners of the Dutch and Walloon congregations were

commanded to attend the established church; and indulgence was granted to

none after the children of the first denizens.[v]

 

Scudamore, too, the king’s ambassador at Paris, had orders to withdraw

himself from the communion of the Hugonots. Even men of sense were apt to

blame this conduct, not only because it gave offence in England, but

because, in foreign countries, it lost the crown the advantage of being

considered as the head and support of the reformation.[*]

 

On pretence of pacifying disputes, orders were issued from the council,

forbidding on both sides all preaching and printing with regard to the

controverted points of predestination and free will. But it was complained

of, and probably with reason that the impartiality was altogether confined

to the orders, and that the execution of them was only meant against the

Calvinists.

 

In return for Charles’s indulgence towards the church, Laud and his

followers took care to magnify, on every occasion, the regal authority,

and to treat with the utmost disdain or detestation all Puritanical

pretensions to a free and independent constitution. But while these

prelates were so liberal in raising the crown at the expense of public

liberty, they made no scruple of encroaching, themselves, on the royal

rights the most incontestable, in order to exalt the hierarchy, and

procure to their own order dominion and independence. All the doctrines

which the Romish church had borrowed from some of the fathers, and which

freed the spiritual from subordination to the civil power, were now

adopted by the church of England, and interwoven with her political and

religious tenets. A divine and apostolical charter was insisted on,

preferably to a legal and parliamentary one.[**]

 

The sacerdotal character was magnified as sacred and indefeasible: all

right to spiritual authority, or even to private judgment in spiritual

subjects, was refused to profane laymen: ecclesiastical courts were held

by the bishops in their own name, without any notice taken of the king’s

authority: and Charles, though extremely jealous of every claim in popular

assemblies, seemed rather to encourage than repress those encroachments of

his clergy. Having felt many sensible inconveniencies from the independent

spirit of parliaments, he attached himself entirely to those who professed

a devoted obedience to his crown and person; nor did he foresee, that the

ecclesiastical power which he exalted, not admitting of any precise

boundary, might in time become more dangerous to public peace, and no less

fatal to royal prerogative, than the other.

 

So early as the coronation, Laud was the person, according to general

opinion, that introduced a novelty which, though overlooked by Charles,

made a deep impression on many of the bystanders. After the usual

ceremonies, these words were recited to the king: “Stand and hold fast,

from henceforth the place to which you have been heir by the succession of

your forefathers, being now delivered to you by the authority of Almighty

God, and by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants of God. And,

as you see the clergy to come nearer the altar than others, so remember

that, in all places convenient, you give them greater honor; that the

Mediator of God and man may establish you on the kingly throne, to be a

mediator betwixt the clergy and the laity; and that you may reign forever

with Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.” [*]

 

The principles which exalted prerogative, were not entertained by the king

merely as soft and agreeable to his royal ears; they were also put in

practice during the time that he ruled without parliaments. Though frugal

and regular in his expense, he wanted money for the support of government;

and he levied it, either by the revival of obsolete laws, or by

violations, some more open, some more disguised, of the privileges of the

nation. Though humane and gentle in his temper, he gave way to a few

severities in the star chamber and high commission, which seemed necessary

in order to support the present mode of administration, and repress the

rising spirit of liberty throughout the kingdom. Under these two heads may

be reduced all the remarkable transactions of this reign during some

years; for, in peaceable and prosperous times, where a neutrality in

foreign affairs is observed, scarcely any thing is remarkable, but what is

in some degree blamed or blamable. And, lest the hope of relief or

protection from parliament might encourage opposition, Charles issued a

proclamation, in which he declared, “That whereas, for several ill ends,

the calling again of a parliament is divulged; though his majesty has

shown, by frequent meetings with his people, his love to the use of

parliaments: yet the late abuse having for the present driven him

unwillingly out of that course; he will account it presumption for anyone

to prescribe to him any time for the calling of that assembly.”[**]

 

This was generally construed as a declaration, that during this reign no

more parliaments were intended to be summoned.[*] And every measure of the

king’s confirmed a suspicion so disagreeable to the generality of the

people.

 

Tonnage and poundage continued to be levied by the royal authority alone.

The former additional impositions were still exacted. Even new impositions

were laid on several kinds of merchandise.[**]

 

The custom-house officers received orders from the council to enter into

any house, warehouse, or cellar; to search any trunk or chest; and to

break any bulk whatever; in default of the payment of customs.[***]

 

In order to exercise the militia, and to keep them in good order, each

county, by an edict of the council, was assessed in a certain sum, for

maintaining a muster-master, appointed for that service.[****]

 

Compositions were openly made with recusants, and the Popish religion

became a regular part of the revenue. This was all the persecution which

it underwent during the reign of Charles.[v]

 

A commission was granted for compounding with such as were possessed of

crown lands upon defective titles; and on this pretence some money was

exacted from the people.[v*]

 

There was a law of Edward II.,[v**] that whoever was possessed of twenty

pounds a year in land, should be obliged, when summoned, to appear and to

receive the order of knighthood. Twenty pounds at that time, partly by the

change of denomination, partly by that in the value of money, were

equivalent to two hundred in the seventeenth century; and it seemed just

that the king should not strictly insist on the letter of the law, and

oblige people of so small revenue to accept of that expensive honor.

Edward VI,[v***] and Queen Elizabeth,[v****] who had both of them made use

of this expedient for raising money, had summoned only those who were

possessed of forty pounds a year and upwards to receive knighthood, or

compound for their neglect; and Charles imitated their example, in

granting the same indulgence.

 

Commissioners were appointed for fixing the rates of composition; and

instructions were given to these commissioners not to accept of a less sum

than would have been due by the party upon a tax of three subsidies and a

half.[*] Nothing proves more plainly how ill disposed the people were to

the measures of the crown, than to observe that they loudly complained of

an expedient founded on positive statute, and warranted by such recent

precedents. The law was pretended to be obsolete; though only one reign

had intervened since the last execution of it.

 

Barnard, lecturer of St. Sepulchre’s, London, used this expression in his

prayer before sermon: “Lord, open the eyes of the queen’s majesty, that

she may see Jesus Christ, whom she has pierced with her infidelity,

superstition, and idolatry.” He was questioned in the high commission

court for this insult on the queen; but, upon his submission,

dismissed.[**] Leighton, who had written libels against the king, the

queen, the bishops, and the whole administration, was condemned by a very

severe, if not a cruel sentence; but the execution of it was suspended for

some time, in expectation of his submission.[***] All the severities,

indeed, of this reign were exercised against those who triumphed in their

sufferings, who courted persecution, and braved authority; and on that

account their punishment may be deemed the more just, but the less

prudent. To have neglected them entirely, had it been consistent with

order and public safety, had been the wisest measure that could have been

embraced; as perhaps it had been the most severe punishment that could

have been inflicted on these zealots.

 

1631.

 

In order to gratify the clergy with a magnificent fabric, subscriptions

were set on foot for repairing and rebuilding St. Paul’s; and the king, by

his countenance and example, encouraged this laudable undertaking.[****]

By order of the privy council, St. Gregory’s church was removed, as an

impediment to the project of extending and beautifying the cathedral. Some

houses and shops likewise were pulled down, and compensation was made to

the owners.[v]

 

As there was no immediate prospect of assembling a parliament, such acts

of power in the king became necessary; and in no former age would the

people have entertained any scruple with regard to them. It must be

remarked, that the Puritans were extremely averse to the raising of this

ornament to the capital. It savored, as they pretended, of Popish

superstition.

 

A stamp duty was imposed on cards; a new tax, which of itself was liable

to no objection, but appeared of dangerous consequence when considered as

arbitrary and illegal.[*]

 

Monopolies were revived; an oppressive method of levying money, being

unlimited, as well as destructive of industry. The last parliament of

James, which abolished monopolies, had left an equitable exception in

favor of new inventions; and on pretence of these, and of erecting new

companies and corporations, was this grievance now renewed. The

manufacture of soap was given to a company who paid a sum for their

patent.[**] Leather, salt, and many other commodities, even down to linen

rags, were likewise put under restrictions.

 

It is affirmed by Clarendon, that so little benefit was reaped from these

projects, that of two hundred thousand pounds thereby levied on the

people, scarcely one thousand five hundred came into the king’s coffers.

Though we ought not to suspect the noble historian of exaggerations to the

disadvantage of Charles’s measures, this fact, it must be owned, appears

somewhat incredible. The same author adds, that the king’s intention was

to teach his subjects how unthrifty a thing it was to refuse reasonable

supplies to the crown: an imprudent project: to offend a whole nation

under the view of punishment: and to hope by acts of violence to break

their refractory spirits, without being possessed of any force to prevent

resistance.

 

1632.

 

The council of York had been first erected, after a rebellion, by a patent

from Henry VIII., without any authority of parliament; and this exercise

cf power, like many others, was indulged to that arbitrary monarch. This

council had long acted chiefly as a criminal court; but, besides some

innovations introduced by James, Charles thought proper some time after

Wentworth was made president, to extend its powers, and to give it a large

civil jurisdiction, and that in some respects discretionary.[***]

 

It is not improbable, that the king’s intention was only to prevent

inconveniencies, which arose from the bringing of every cause, from the

most distant parts of the kingdom, into Westminster Hall: but the

consequence, in the mean time, of this measure, was the putting of all the

northern counties out of the protection of ordinary law, and subjecting

them to an authority somewhat arbitrary. Some irregular acts of that

council were this year complained of.[*]

 

1633.

 

The court of star chamber extended its authority; and it was matter of

complaint that it encroached upon the jurisdiction of the other courts;

imposing heavy fines and inflicting severe punishment, beyond the usual

course of justice. Sir David Foulis was fined five thousand pounds,

chiefly because he had dissuaded a friend from compounding with the

commissioners of knighthood.[**]

 

Prynne, a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn, had written an enormous quarto of a

thousand pages, which he called Histrio-Mastyx. Its professed purpose was

to decry stage-plays, comedies, interludes, music, dancing; but the author

likewise took occasion to declaim against hunting, public festivals,

Christmas-keeping, bonfires, and may-poles. His zeal against all these

levities, he says, was first moved by observing that plays sold better

than the choicest sermons, and that they were frequently printed on finer

paper than the Bible itself. Besides, that the players were often Papists,

and desperately wicked; the play-houses, he affirms, are Satan’s chapels;

the play-haunters little better than incarnate devils; and so many steps

in a dance, so many paces to hell. The chief crime of Nero, he represents

to have been his frequenting and acting of plays; and those who nobly

conspired his death, were principally moved to it, as he affirms, by their

indignation at that enormity. The rest of his thousand pages is of a like

strain. He had obtained a license from Archbishop Abbot’s chaplain; yet

was he indicted in the star chamber as a libeller. It was thought somewhat

hard that general invectives against plays should be interpreted into

satires against the king and queen, merely because they frequented these

amusements, and because the queen sometimes acted a part in pastorals and

interludes which were represented at court. The author, it must be owned,

had, in plainer terms, blamed the hierarchy, the ceremonies, the

innovations in religious worship, and the new superstitions introduced by

Laud;[*] and this, probably, together with the obstinacy and petulance of

his behavior before the star chamber, was the reason why his sentence was

so severe. He was condemned to be put from the bar; to stand on the

pillory in two places, Westminster and Cheapside; to lose both his ears,

one in each place; to pay five thousand pounds’ fine to the king; and to

be imprisoned during life.[**]

 

This same Prynne was a great hero among the Puritans; and it was chiefly

with a view of mortifying that sect, that though of an honorable

profession, he was condemned by the star chamber to so ignominious a

punishment. The thorough-paced Puritans were distinguishable by the

sourness and austerity of their manners, and by their aversion to all

pleasure and society.[***] To inspire them with better humor was

certainly, both for their own sake and that of the public, a laudable

intention in the court; but whether pillories, fines and prisons were

proper expedients for that purpose, may admit of some question.

 

Another expedient which the king tried, in order to infuse cheerfulness

into the national devotion, was not much more successful. He renewed his

father’s edict for allowing sports and recreations on Sunday to such as

attended public worship; and he ordered his proclamation for that purpose

to be publicly read by the clergy after divine service.[****] Those who

were Puritanically affected refused obedience, and were punished by

suspension or deprivation. The differences between the sects were before

sufficiently great; nor was it necessary to widen them further by these

inventions.

 

Some encouragement and protection which the king and the bishops gave to

wakes, church ales, bride ales, and other cheerful festivals of the common

people, were the objects of like scandal to the Puritans.[v]

 

The music in the churches he affirmed not to be the noise of men, but a

bleating of brute beasts; choristers bellow the tenor, as it were oxen;

bark a counterpart, as it were a kennel of dogs; roar out a treble, as it

were a sort of bulls; and grunt out a bass, as it were a number of hogs:

Christmas, as it is kept, is the devil’s Christmas: and Prynne employed a

great number of pages to persuade men to affect the name of “Puritan,” as

if Christ had been a Puritan; and so he saith in his index.

 

This year, Charles made a journey to Scotland, attended by the court, in

order to hold a parliament there, and to pass through the ceremony of his

coronation. The nobility and gentry of both kingdoms rivalled each other

in expressing all duty and respect to the king, and in showing mutual

friendship and regard to each other. No one could have suspected, from

exterior appearances, that such dreadful scenes were approaching.

 

One chief article of business, (for it deserves the name,) which the king

transacted in this parliament, was, besides obtaining some supply, to

procure authority for ordering the habits of clergymen.[*] The act did not

pass without opposition and difficulty. The dreadful surplice was before

men’s eyes, and they apprehended, with some reason, that under sanction of

this law, it would soon be introduced among them. Though the king believed

that his prerogative entitled him to a power, in general, of directing

whatever belonged to the exterior government of the church, this was

deemed a matter of too great importance to be ordered without the sanction

of a particular statute.

 

Immediately after the king’s return to England, he heard of Archbishop

Abbot’s death; and, without delay, he conferred that dignity on his

favorite, Laud; who, by this accession of authority, was now enabled to

maintain ecclesiastical discipline with greater rigor, and to aggravate

the general discontent of the nation.

 

Laud obtained the bishopric of London for his friend Juxon: and, about a

year after the death of Sir Richard Weston, created earl of Portland, had

interest enough to engage the king to make that prelate high treasurer.

Juxon was a person of great integrity, mildness, and humanity, and endued

with a good understanding.[**] Yet did this last promotion give general

offence. His birth and character were deemed too obscure for a man raised

to one of the highest offices of the crown. And the clergy, it was

thought, were already too much elated by former instances of the king’s

attachment to them, and needed not this further encouragement to assume

dominion over the laity.[***] The Puritans, likewise, were much

dissatisfied with Juxon, notwithstanding his eminent virtues, because he

was a lover of profane field sports and hunting.

 

1634.

 

Ship money was now introduced. The first writs of this kind had been

directed to seaport towns only: but ship money was at this time levied on

the whole kingdom; and each county was rated at a particular sum, which

was after wards assessed upon individuals.[*] The amount of the whole tax

was very moderate, little exceeding two hundred thousand pounds: it was

levied upon the people with equality: the money was entirely expended on

the navy, to the great honor and advantage of the kingdom: as England had

no military force, while all the other powers of Europe were strongly

armed, a fleet seemed absolutely necessary for her security; and it was

obvious, that a navy must be built and equipped at leisure, during peace;

nor could it possibly be fitted out on a sudden emergence, when the danger

became urgent; yet all these considerations could not reconcile the people

to the imposition. It was entirely arbitrary: by the same right any other

tax might be imposed: and men thought a powerful fleet, though very

desirable both for the credit and safety of the kingdom, but an unequal

recompense for their liberties, which, they apprehended, were thus

sacrificed to the obtaining of it.

 

England, it must be owned, was in this respect unhappy in its present

situation, that the king had entertained a very different idea of the

constitution, from that which began in general to prevail among his

subjects. He did not regard national privileges as so sacred and

inviolable, that nothing but the most extreme necessity could justify an

infringement of them. He considered himself as the supreme magistrate, to

whose care Heaven, by his birthright, had committed his people; whose duty

it was to provide for their security and happiness, and who was vested

with ample discretionary powers for that salutary purpose. If the

observance of ancient laws and customs was consistent with the present

convenience of government, he thought himself obliged to comply with that

rule, as the easiest, the safest, and what procured the most prompt and

willing obedience. But when a change of circumstances, especially if

derived from the obstinacy of the people, required a new plan of

administration, national privileges, he thought, must yield to supreme

power; nor could any order of the state oppose any right to the will of

the sovereign, directed to the good of the public.[**]

 

That these principles of government were derived from the uniform tenor of

the English laws, it would be rash to affirm. The fluctuating nature of

the constitution, the impatient humor of the people, and the variety of

events, had, no doubt, in different ages, produced exceptions and

contradictions. These observations alone may be established on both sides,

that the appearances were sufficiently strong in favor of the king to

apologize for his following such maxims; and that public liberty must be

so precarious under this exorbitant prerogative, as to render an

opposition not only excusable, but laudable in the people.[*] 4
 

Some laws had been enacted, during the reign of Henry VII., against

depopulation, or the converting of arable lands into pasture. By a decree

of the star chamber, Sir Anthony Roper was fined four thousand pounds for

an offence of that nature.[**] This severe sentence was intended to

terrify others into composition; and above thirty thousand pounds were

levied by that expedient.[***] Like compositions, or, in default of them,

heavy fines, were required for encroachments on the king’s forests, whose

bounds, by decrees deemed arbitrary, were extended much beyond what was

usual.[****] The bounds of one forest, that of Rockingham, were increased

from six miles to sixty.[v] The same refractory humor which made the

people refuse to the king voluntary supplies, disposed them, with better

reason, to murmur against these irregular methods of taxation.

 

Morley was fined ten thousand pounds for reviling, challenging, and

striking, in the court of Whitehall, Sir George Theobald, one of the

king’s servants.[v*] This fine was thought exorbitant; but whether it was

compounded, as was usual in fines imposed by the star chamber, we are not

informed.

 

Allison had reported, that the archbishop of York had incurred the king’s

displeasure, by asking a limited toleration for the Catholics, and an

allowance to build some churches for the exercise of their religion. For

this slander against the archbishop, he was condemned in the star chamber

to be fined one thousand pounds, to be committed to prison, to be bound to

his good behavior during life, to be whipped, and to be set on the pillory

at Westminster, and in three other towns in England. Robins, who had been

an accomplice in the guilt, was condemned by a sentence equally severe.[*]

Such events are rather to be considered as rare and detached incidents,

collected by the severe scrutiny of historians, than as proofs of the

prevailing genius of the king’s administration which seems to have been

more gentle and equitable than, that of most of his predecessors: there

were, on the whole, only five or six such instances of rigor during the

course of fifteen years, which elapsed before the meeting of the long

parliament. And it is also certain, that scandal against the great, though

seldom prosecuted at present, is, however, in the eye of the law, a great

crime, and subjects the offender to very heavy penalties.

 

There are other instances of the high respect paid to the nobility and to

the great in that age, when the powers of monarchy, though disputed, still

maintained themselves in their pristine vigor. Clarendon[**] tells us a

pleasant incident to this purpose: a waterman, belonging to a man of

quality, having a squabble with a citizen about his fare, showed his

badge, the crest of his master, which happened to be a swan; and thence

insisted on better treatment from the citizen. But the other replied

carelessly, that he did not trouble his head about that goose. For this

offence, he was summoned before the marshal’s court; was fined, as having

opprobriously defamed the nobleman’s crest, by calling the swan a goose;

and was in effect reduced to beggary.

 

Sir Richard Granville had thought himself ill used by the earl of Suffolk

in a lawsuit; and he was accused before the star chamber of having said of

that nobleman, that he was a base lord. The evidence against him was

somewhat lame; yet for this slight offence, insufficiently proved, he was

condemned to pay a fine of eight thousand pounds; one half to the earl,

the other to the king.[***]

 

Sir George Markham, following a chase where Lord Darcy’s huntsman was

exercising his hounds, kept closer to the dogs than was thought proper by

the huntsman, who, besides other rudeness, gave him foul language, which

Sir George returned with a stroke of his whip. The fellow threatened to

complain to his master: the knight replied, “If his master should justify

such insolence, he would serve him in the same manner;” or words to that

effect. Sir George was summoned before the Star chamber, and fined ten

thousand pounds: “So fine a thing was it in those days to be a lord!”—a

natural reflection of Lord Lansdown’s in relating this incident.[*] The

people, in vindicating their liberties from the authority of the crown,

threw off also the yoke of the nobility. It is proper to remark that this

last incident happened early in the reign of James. The present practice

of the star chamber was far from being an innovation; though the present

dispositions of the people made them repine more at this servitude.

 

1635.

 

Charles had imitated the example of Elizabeth and James, and had issued

proclamations forbidding the landed gentlemen and the nobility to live

idly in London, and ordering them to retire to their country seats.[**]

For disobedience to this edict, many were indicted by the

attorney-general, and were fined in the star chamber.[***] This occasioned

discontents; and the sentences were complained of as illegal. But if

proclamations had authority, of which nobody pretended to doubt, must they

not be put in execution? In no instance I must confess, does it more

evidently appear, what confused and uncertain ideas were during that age

entertained concerning the English constitution.

 

Ray, having exported fuller’s earth, contrary to the king’s proclamation,

was, besides the pillory, condemned in the star chamber to a fine of two

thousand pounds.[****] Like fines were levied on Terry, Eman, and others,

for disobeying a proclamation which forbade the exportation of gold.[v] In

order to account for the subsequent convulsions, even these incidents are

not to be overlooked as frivolous or contemptible. Such severities were

afterwards magnified into the greatest enormities.

 

There remains a proclamation of this year, prohibiting hackney coaches

from standing in the street.[v*] We are told, that there were not above

twenty coaches of that kind in London. There are at present near eight

hundred.

 

1636.

 

The effects of ship money began now to appear. A formidable fleet of sixty

sail, the greatest that England had ever known, was equipped under the

earl of Northumberland, who had orders to attack the herring busses of the

Dutch, which fished in what were called the British seas. The Dutch were

content to pay thirty thousand pounds for a license during this year. They

openly denied, however, the claim of dominion in the seas beyond the

friths, bays, and shores; and it may be questioned whether the laws of

nations warrant any further pretensions.

 

This year, the king sent a squadron against Sallee; and, with the

assistance of the emperor of Morocco, destroyed that receptacle of

pirates, by whom the English commerce, and even the English coasts, had

long been infested.

 

1637.

 

Burton, a divine, and Bastwick, a physician, were tried in the star

chamber for seditious and schismatical libels, and were condemned to the

same punishment that had been inflicted on Prynne. Prynne himself was

tried for a new offence; and, together with another fine of five thousand

pounds, was condemned to lose what remained of his ears. Besides that

these writers had attacked with great severity, and even an intemperate

zeal, the ceremonies, rites, and government of the church, the very

answers which they gave in to the court were so full of contumacy and of

invectives against the prelates, that no lawyer could be prevailed on to

sign them.[*] The rigors, however, which they underwent, being so unworthy

men of their profession, gave general offence; and the patience, or rather

alacrity, with which they suffered, increased still further the

indignation of the public.[**]

 

The severity of the star chamber, which was generally ascribed to Laud’s

passionate disposition, was, perhaps, in itself somewhat blamable; but

will naturally, to us, appear enormous, who enjoy, in the utmost latitude,

that liberty of the press, which is esteemed so necessary in every

monarchy, confined by strict legal limitations. But as these limitations

were not regularly fixed during the age of Charles, nor at any time

before, so was this liberty totally unknown, and was generally deemed, as

well as religious toleration, incompatible with all good government. No

age or nation among the moderns had ever set an example of such an

indulgence; and it seems unreasonable to judge of the measures embraced

during one period by the maxims which prevail in another.

 

Burton, in his book where he complained of innovations mentioned, among

others, that a certain Wednesday had been appointed for a fast, and that

the fast was ordered to be celebrated without any sermons.[*] The

intention, as he pretended, of that novelty was, by the example of a fast

without sermons, to suppress all the Wednesday’s lectures in London. It is

observable, that the church of Rome and that of England, being both of

them lovers of form, and ceremony, and order, are more friends to prayer

than preaching; while the Puritanical sectaries, who find that the latter

method of address, being directed to a numerous audience present and

visible, is more inflaming and animating, have always regarded it as the

chief part of divine service. Such circumstances, though minute, it may

not be improper to transmit to posterity; and those who are curious of

tracing the history of the human mind, may remark how far its several

singularities coincide in different ages.

 

Certain zealots had erected themselves into a society for buying in of

impropriations, and transferring them to the church; and great sums of

money had been bequeathed to the society for these purposes. But it was

soon observed, that the only use which they made of their funds was to

establish lecturers in all the considerable churches; men who, without

being subjected to Episcopal authority, employed themselves entirely in

preaching and spreading the fire of Puritanism. Laud took care, by a

decree which was passed in the court of exchequer, and which was much

complained of, to abolish this society, and to stop their progress.[**] It

was, however, still observed, that throughout England the lecturers were

all of them Puritanically affected; and from them the clergymen, who

contented themselves with reading prayers and homilies to the people,

commonly received the reproachful appellation of “dumb dogs.”

 

The bishop of Norwich, by rigorously insisting on uniformity, had banished

many industrious tradesmen from that city, and chased them into

Holland.[***] The Dutch began to be more intent on commerce than on

orthodoxy; and thought that the knowledge of useful arts and obedience to

the laws formed a good citizen; though attended with errors in subjects

where it is not allowable for human nature to expect any positive truth or

certainty.

 

Complaints about this time were made, that the petition of right was in

some instances violated; and that, upon a commitment by the king and

council, bail or releasement had been refused to Jennings, Pargiter, and

Danvers.[****]

 

Williams, bishop of Lincoln, a man of spirit and learning, a popular

prelate, and who had been lord keeper, was fined ten thousand pounds by

the star chamber, committed to the Tower during the king’s pleasure, and

suspended from his office. This severe sentence was founded on frivolous

pretences, and was more ascribed to Laud’s vengeance, than to any guilt of

the bishop.[v] Laud, however, had owed his first promotion to the good

offices of that prelate with King James. But so implacable was the haughty

primate, that he raised up a new prosecution against Williams, on the

strangest pretence imaginable.

 

In order to levy the fine above mentioned, some officers had been sent to

seize all the furniture and books of his episcopal palace of Lincoln; and

in rummaging the house, they found in a corner some neglected letters,

which had been thrown by as useless. These letters were written by one

Osbaldistone, a schoolmaster, and were directed to Williams. Mention was

there made of “a little great man;” and in another passage, the same

person was denominated “a little urchin.” By inferences and constructions,

these epithets were applied to Laud; and on no better foundation was

Williams tried anew, as having received scandalous letters, and not

discovering that private correspondence. For this offence, another fine of

eight thousand pounds was levied on him: Osbaldistone was likewise brought

to trial, and condemned to pay a fine of five thousand pounds, and to have

his ears nailed to the pillory before his own school. He saved himself by

flight; and left a note in his study, wherein he said, “that he was gone

beyond Canterbury.”[*]

 

These prosecutions of Williams seem to have been the most iniquitous

measure pursued by the court during the time that the use of parliaments

was suspended. Williams had been indebted for all his fortune to the favor

of James; but having quarrelled, first with Buckingham, then with Laud, he

threw himself into the country party; and with great firmness and vigor

opposed all the measures of the king. A creature of the court to become

its obstinate enemy, a bishop to countenance Puritans; these circumstances

excited indignation, and engaged the ministers in those severe measures.

Not to mention, what some writers relate, that, before the sentence was

pronounced against him, Williams was offered a pardon upon his submission,

which he refused to make; the court was apt to think, that so refractory a

spirit must by any expedient be broken and subdued.

 

In a former trial which Williams underwent,[**] (for these were not the

first,) there was mentioned in court a story, which, as it discovers the

genius of parties, may be worth relating. Sir John Lambe urging him to

prosecute the Puritans, the prelate asked what sort of people these same

Puritans were. Sir John replied, “that to the world they seemed to be such

as would not swear, whore, or be drunk; out they would lie, cozen, and

deceive; that they would frequently hear two sermons a day, and repeat

them too, and that some, times they would fast all day long.” This

character must be conceived to be satirical; yet it may be allowed, that

that sect was more averse to such irregularities as proceed from the

excess of gayety and pleasure, than to those enormities which are the most

destructive of society, The former were opposite to the very genius and

spirit of their religion; the latter were only a transgression of its

precepts: and it was not difficult for a gloomy enthusiast to convince

himself, that a strict observance of the one would atone for any violation

of the other.

 

In 1632, the treasurer Portland had insisted with the vintners, that they

should submit to a tax of a penny a quart upon all the wine which they

retailed; but they rejected the demand, In order to punish them, a decree

suddenly, without much inquiry or examination, passed in the star chamber,

prohibiting them to sell or dress victuals in their houses.[*] Two years

after, they were questioned for the breach of this decree; and in order to

avoid punishment, they agreed to lend the king six thousand pounds. Being

threatened, during the subsequent years, with fines and prosecutions, they

at last compounded the matter, and submitted to pay half of that duty

which was at first demanded of them.[**] It required little foresight to

perceive, that the king’s right of issuing proclamations must, if

prosecuted, draw on a power of taxation.

 

Lilburne was accused before the star chamber of publishing and dispersing

seditious pamphlets. He was ordered to be examined; but refused to take

the oath usual in that court that he would answer interrogatories, even

though they might lead him to accuse himself. For this contempt, as it was

interpreted, he was condemned to be whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned.

While he was whipped at the cart, and stood on the pillory, he harangued

the populace, and declaimed violently against the tyranny of bishops. From

his pockets also he scattered pamphlets, said to be seditious, because

they attacked the hierarchy. The star chamber, which was sitting at that

very time, ordered him immediately to be gagged. He ceased not, however,

though both gagged and pilloried, to stamp with his foot and gesticulate,

in order to show the people that, if he had it in his power, he would

still harangue them. This behavior gave fresh provocation to the star

chamber; and they condemned him to be imprisoned in a dungeon, and to be

loaded with irons.[*] It was found difficult to break the spirits of men

who placed both their honor and their conscience in suffering.

 

The jealousy of the church appeared in another instance less tragical.

Archy, the king’s fool, who by his office had the privilege of jesting on

his master and the whole court, happened unluckily to try his wit upon

Laud, who was too sacred a person to be played with. News having arrived

from Scotland of the first commotions excited by the liturgy, Archy,

seeing the primate pass by, called to him, “Who’s fool now, my lord?” For

this offence Archy was ordered, by sentence of the council, to have his

coat pulled over his head and to be dismissed the king’s service.[**]

 

Here is another instance of that rigorous subjection in which all men were

held by Laud. Some young gentlemen of Lincoln’s Inn, heated by their cups,

having drunk confusion to the archbishop, were at his instigation cited

before the star chamber. They applied to the earl of Dorset for

protection. “Who bears witness against you?” said Dorset. “One of the

drawers,” they said. “Where did he stand when you were supposed to drink

this health?” subjoined the earl, “He was at the door,” they replied,

“going out of the room.” “Tush!” cried he, “the drawer must be mistaken:

you drank confusion to the archbishop of Canterbury’s enemies and the

fellow was gone before you pronounced the last word.” This hint supplied

the young gentlemen with a new method of defence: and being advised by

Dorset to behave with great humility and great submission to the primate,

the modesty of their carriage, the ingenuity of their apology, with the

patronage of that noble lord, saved them from any severer punishment than

a reproof and admonition, with which they were dismissed.[***]

 

This year, John Hambden acquired, by his spirit and courage, universal

popularity throughout the nation, and has merited great renown with

posterity, for the bold stand which he made in defence of the laws and

liberties of his country. After the imposing of ship money, Charles, in

order to discourage all opposition, had proposed this question to the

judges: “Whether, in a case of necessity, for the defence of the kingdom,

he might not impose this taxation; and whether he were not sole judge of

the necessity.” These guardians of law and liberty replied, with great

complaisance, “that in a case of necessity he might impose that taxation,

and that he was sole judge of the necessity.”[*] Hambden had been rated at

twenty shillings for an estate which he possessed in the county of

Buckingham: yet, notwithstanding this declared opinion of the judges,

notwithstanding the great power and sometimes rigorous maxims of the

crown, notwithstanding the small prospect of relief from parliament, he

resolved, rather than tamely submit to so illegal an imposition, to stand

a legal prosecution, and expose himself to all the indignation of the

court. The case was argued during twelve days, in the exchequer chamber,

before all the judges of England; and the nation regarded, with the utmost

anxiety, every circumstance of this celebrated trial. The event was easily

foreseen: but the principles, and reasonings, and behavior of the parties

engaged in the trial, were much canvassed and inquired into; and nothing

could equal the favor paid to the one side, except the hatred which

attended the other.

 

It was urged by Hambden’s counsel, and by his partisans in the nation,

that the plea of necessity was in vain introduced into a trial of law;

since it was the nature of necessity to abolish all law, and, by

irresistible violence, to dissolve all the weaker and more artificial ties

of human society. Not only the prince, in cases of extreme distress, is

exempted from the ordinary rules of administration: all orders of men are

then levelled; and any individual may consult the public safety by any

expedient which his situation enables him to employ. But to produce so

violent an effect, and so hazardous to every community, an ordinary danger

or difficulty is not sufficient; much less a necessity which is merely

fictitious and pretended. Where the peril is urgent and extreme, it will

be palpable to every member of the society; and though all ancient rules

of government are in that case abrogated, men will readily, of themselves,

submit to that irregular authority which is exerted for their

preservation. But what is there in common between such suppositions and

the present condition of the nation? England enjoys a profound peace with

al her neighbors; and what is more, all her neighbors are engaged in

furious and bloody wars among themselves, and by their mutual enmities

further insure their tranquillity. The very writs themselves, which are

issued for the levying of ship money, contradict the supposition of

necessity, and pretend only that the seas are infested with pirates; a

slight and temporary inconvenience, which may well await a legal supply

from parliament. The writs likewise allow several months for equipping the

ships; which proves a very calm and deliberate species of necessity, and

one that admits of delay much beyond the forty days requisite for

summoning that assembly. It is strange, too, that an extreme necessity,

which is always apparent, and usually comes to a sudden crisis, should now

have continued without interruption for near four years, and should have

remained during so long a time invisible to the whole kingdom. And as to

the pretension, that the king is sole judge of the necessity, what is this

but to subject all the privileges of the nation to his arbitrary will and

pleasure? To expect that the public will be convinced by such reasoning,

must aggravate the general indignation, by adding to violence against

men’s persons, and their property, so cruel a mockery of their

understanding.

 

In vain are precedents of ancient writs produced: these writs, when

examined, are only found to require the seaports, sometimes at their own

charge, sometimes at the charge of the counties, to send their ships for

the defence of the nation. Even the prerogative which empowered the crown

to issue such writs is abolished, and its exercise almost entirely

discontinued from the time of Edward III.;[*] and all the authority which

remained, or was afterwards exercised, was to press ships into the public

service, to be paid for by the public.

 

How wide are these precedents from a power of obliging the people, at

their own charge, to build new ships, to victual and pay them, for the

public; nay, to furnish money to the crown for that purpose? What security

either against the further extension of this claim, or against diverting

to other purposes the public money so levied? The plea of necessity would

warrant any other taxation as well as that of ship money; wherever any

difficulty shall occur, the administration, instead of endeavoring to

elude or overcome it by gentle and prudent measures, will instantly

represent it as a reason for infringing all ancient laws and institutions:

and if such maxims and such practices prevail, what has become of national

liberty? What authority is left to the Great Charter, to the statutes, and

to the very petition of right, which in the present reign had been so

solemnly enacted by the concurrence of the whole legislature?

 

The defenceless condition of the kingdom while unprovided with a navy; the

inability of the king, from his established revenues, with the utmost care

and frugality, to equip and maintain one; the impossibility of obtaining,

on reasonable terms, any voluntary supply from parliament; all these are

reasons of state, not topics of law. If these reasons appear to the king

so urgent as to dispense with the legal rules of government, let him

enforce his edicts by his court of star chamber, the proper instrument of

irregular and absolute power, not prostitute the character of his judges

by a decree which is not, and cannot possibly be legal. By this means, the

boundaries, at least, will be kept more distinct between ordinary law and

extraordinary exertions of prerogative; and men will know, that the

national constitution is only suspended during a present and difficult

emergence, but has not under gone a total and fundamental alteration.

 

Notwithstanding these reasons, the prejudiced judges, four[*] excepted,

gave sentence in favor of the crown. Hambden, however, obtained by the

trial the end for which he had so generously sacrificed his safety and his

quiet: the people were roused from their lethargy, and became sensible of

the danger to which their liberties were exposed.

 

These national questions were canvassed in every company; and the more

they were examined, the more evidently did it appear to many, that liberty

was totally subverted, and an unusual and arbitrary authority exercised

over the kingdom. Slavish principles they said, concur with illegal

practices; ecclesiastical tyranny gives aid to civil usurpation;

iniquitous taxes are supported by arbitrary punishments; and all the

privileges of the nation, transmitted through so many ages, secured by so

many laws and purchased by the blood of so many heroes and patriots, now

lie prostrate at the feet of the monarch. What though public peace and

national industry increased the commerce and opulence of the kingdom? This

advantage was temporary, and due alone, not to any encouragement given by

the crown, but to the spirit of the English, the remains of their ancient

freedom. What though the personal character of the king amidst all his

misguided counsels, might merit indulgence, or even praise? He was but one

man; and the privileges of the people, the inheritance of millions, were

too valuable to be sacrificed to his prejudices and mistakes. Such, or

more severe, were the sentiments promoted by a great party in the nation:

no excuse on the king’s part, or alleviation, how reasonable soever, could

be hearkened to or admitted: and to redress these grievances, a parliament

was impatiently longed for; or any other incident, however calamitous,

that might secure the people against these oppressions which they felt, or

the greater ills which they apprehended from the combined encroachments of

church and state.
