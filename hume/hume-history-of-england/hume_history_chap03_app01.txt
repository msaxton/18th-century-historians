The government of the Germans, and that of all the northern nations who

      established themselves on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free;

      and those fierce people, accustomed to independence and inured to arms,

      were more guided by persuasion than authority in the submission which they

      paid to their princes. The military despotism which had taken place in the

      Roman empire, and which, previously to the irruption of those conquerors,

      had sunk the genius of men, and destroyed every noble principle of science

      and virtue, was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free people;

      and Europe, as from a new epoch, rekindled her ancient spirit, and shook

      off the base servitude to arbitrary will and authority under which she had

      so long labored. The free constitutions then established, however impaired

      by the encroachments of succeeding princes, still preserve an air of

      independence and legal administration, which distinguished the European

      nations; and if that part of the globe maintain sentiments of liberty,

      honor, equity, and valor superior to the rest of mankind, it owes these

      advantages chiefly to the seeds implanted by those generous barbarians.

     

      The Saxons who subdued Britain, as they enjoyed great liberty in their own

      country, obstinately retained that invaluable possession in their new

      settlement; and they imported into this island the same principles of

      independence which they had inherited from their ancestors. The

      chieftains, (for such they were, more properly than kings or princes,) who

      commanded them in those military expeditions, still possessed a very

      limited authority; and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than subdued,

      the ancient inhabitants, they were indeed transplanted into a new

      territory, but preserved unaltered all their civil and military

      institutions. The language was pure Saxon; even the names of places, which

      often remain while the tongue entirely changes, were almost all affixed by

      the conquerors; the manners and customs were wholly German; and the same

      picture of a fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the masterly

      pencil of Tacitus, will suit those founders of the English government. The

      king, so far from being invested with arbitrary power, was only considered

      as the first among the citizens; his authority depended more on his

      personal qualities than on his station; he was even so far on a level with

      the people, that a stated price was fixed for his head, and a legal fine

      was levied upon his murderer, which, though proportionate to his station,

      and superior to that paid for the life of a subject, was a sensible mark

      of his subordination to the community.

     

      It is easy to imagine that an independent people, so little restrained by

      law and cultivated by science, would not be very strict in maintaining a

      regular succession of their princes. Though they paid great regard to the

      royal family, and ascribed to it an undisputed superiority, they either

      had no rule, or none that was steadily observed, in filling the vacant

      throne; and present convenience, in that emergency, was more attended to

      than general principles. We are not, however, to suppose that the crown

      was considered as altogether elective; and that a regular plan was traced

      by the constitution for supplying, by the suffrages of the people, every

      vacancy made by the demise of the first magistrate. If any king left a son

      of an age and capacity fit for government, the young prince naturally

      stepped into the throne: if he was a minor, his uncle, or the next prince

      of the blood, was promoted to the government, and left the sceptre to his

      posterity: any sovereign, by taking previous measures with the leading

      men, had it greatly in his power to appoint his successor: all these

      changes, and indeed the ordinary administration of government, required

      the express concurrence, or at least the tacit acquiescence of the people;

      but possession, however obtained, was extremely apt to secure their

      obedience, and the idea of any right, which was once excluded was but

      feeble and imperfect. This is so much the case in all barbarous

      monarchies, and occurs so often in the history of the Anglo-Saxons, that

      we cannot consistently entertain any other notion of their government. The

      idea of an hereditary succession in authority is so natural to men, and is

      so much fortified by the usual rule in transmitting private possessions,

      that it must retain a great influence on every society, which does not

      exclude it by the refinements of a republican constitution. But as there

      is a material difference between gov-* *ernment and private possessions,

      and every man is not as much qualified for exercising the one as for

      enjoying the other, a people who are not sensible of the general

      advantages attending a fixed rule are apt to make great leaps in the

      succession, and frequently to pass over the person, who, had he possessed

      the requisite years and abilities, would have been thought entitled to the

      sovereignty. Thus these monarchies are not, strictly speaking, either

      elective or hereditary; and though the destination of a prince may often

      be followed in appointing his successor, they can as little be regarded as

      wholly testamentary. The states by their suffrage may sometimes establish

      a sovereign; but they more frequently recognize the person whom they find

      established: a few great men take the lead; the people, overawed and

      influenced, acquiesce in the government; and the reigning prince, provided

      he be of the royal family, passes undisputedly for the legal sovereign.

     

      It is confessed that our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon history and

      antiquities is too imperfect to afford us means of determining with

      certainty all the prerogatives of the crown and privileges of the people,

      or of giving an exact delineation of that government. It is probable,

      also, that the constitution might be somewhat different hi the different

      kingdoms of the Heptarchy, and that it changed considerably during the

      course of six centuries, which elapsed from the first invasion of the

      Saxons till the Norman conquest.[*] But most of these differences and

      changes, with their causes and effects, are unknown to us; it only appears

      that, at all times and in all the kingdoms, there was a national council,

      called a wittenagemot, or assembly of the wise men, (for that is the

      import of the term,) whose consent was requisite for enacting laws, and

      for ratifying the chief acts of public administration.

     

      The preambles to all the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, Edward the Elder,

      Athelstan, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred, and Edward the Confessor; even those

      to the laws of Canute though a kind of conqueror, put this matter beyond

      controversy, and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal

      government. But who were the constituent members of this wittenagemot has

      not been determined with certainty by antiquaries. It is agreed that the

      bishops and abbots[*] were an essential part; and it is also evident, from

      the tenor of those ancient laws, that the wittenagemot enacted statutes

      which regulated the ecclesiastical as well as civil government, and that

      those dangerous principles, by which the church is totally severed from

      the state, were hitherto unknown to the Anglo-Saxons.[**] It also appears

      that the aldermen or governors of counties, who, after the Danish times,

      were often called earls,[***] 7 were admitted into this council, and gave their

      consent to the public statutes. But besides the prelates and aldermen,

      there is also mention of the wites, or wisemen, as a component part of the

      wittenagemot; but who these were is not so clearly ascertained by the laws

      or the history of that period. The matter would probably be of difficult

      discussion, even were it examined impartially; but as our modern parties

      have chosen to divide on this point, the question has been disputed with

      the greater obstinacy, and the arguments on both sides have become, on

      that account, the more captious and deceitful. Our monarchical faction

      maintain that these “wites,” or “sapientes,” were the judges, or men

      learned in the law: the popular faction assert them to be representatives

      of the boroughs, or what we now call the commons.

     

      The expressions employed by all ancient historians in mentioning the

      wittenagemot, seem to contradict the latter supposition. The members are

      almost always called the “principes, satrapÃ¦, optimates, magnates,

      proceres;” terms which seem to suppose an aristocracy, and to exclude the

      commons. The boroughs also, from the low state of commerce, were so small

      and so poor, and the inhabitants lived in such dependence on the great

      men,[****] that it seems nowise probable they would be admitted as a part

      of the national councils. The commons are well known to have had no share

      in the governments established by the Franks, Burgundians, and other

      northern nations; and we may conclude that the Saxons, who remained longer

      barbarous and uncivilized than those tribes, would never think of

      conferring such an extraordinary privilege on trade and industry.

     

      The military profession alone was honorable among all those conquerors:

      the warriors subsisted by their possessions in land: they became

      considerable by their influence over their vassals, retainers, tenants,

      and slaves: and it requires strong proof to convince us that they would

      admit any of a rank so much inferior as the burgesses, to share with them

      in the legislative authority. Tacitus indeed affirms that, among the

      ancient Germans, the consent of all the members of the community was

      required in every important deliberation; but he speaks not of

      representatives; and this ancient practice, mentioned by the Roman

      historian, could only have place in small tribes, where every citizen

      might without inconvenience be assembled upon any extraordinary emergency.

      After principalities became extensive, after the difference of property

      had formed distinctions more important than those which arose from

      personal strength and valor, we may conclude that the national assemblies

      must have been more limited in their number, and composed only of the more

      considerable citizens.

     

      But, though we must exclude the burgesses or commons from the Saxon

      wittenagemot, there is some necessity for supposing that this assembly

      consisted of other members than the prelates, abbots, alderman, and the

      judges or privy council. For as all these, excepting some of the

      ecclesiastics,[*] were anciently appointed by the king, had there been no

      other legislative authority, the royal power had been, in a great measure,

      absolute, contrary to the tenor of all the historians, and to the practice

      of all the northern nations.

     

      We may, therefore, conclude that the more considerable proprietors of land

      were, without any election, constituent members of the national assembly:

      there is reason to think that forty hides, or between four and five

      thousand acres, was the estate requisite for entitling the possessors to

      this honorable privilege. We find a passage in an ancient author,[*] by

      which it appears that a person of very noble birth, even one allied to the

      crown, was not esteemed a “princeps” (the term usually employed by ancient

      historians, when the wittenagemot is mentioned) till he had acquired a

      fortune of that amount. Nor need we imagine that the public council would

      become disorderly or confused by admitting so great a multitude. The

      landed property of England was probably in few hands during the Saxon

      times, at least, during the latter part of that period; and, as men had

      hardly any ambition to attend those public councils, there was no danger

      of the assembly’s becoming too numerous for the despatch of the little

      business which was brought before them.

     

      It is certain that, whatever we may determine concerning the constituent

      members of the wittenagemot, in whom, with the king, the legislature

      resided, the Anglo-Saxon government, in the period preceding the Norman

      conquest, was becoming extremely aristocratical: the royal authority was

      very limited; the people, even if admitted to that assembly, were of

      little or no weight and consideration. We have hints given us in

      historians of the great power and riches of particular noblemen; and it

      could not but happen, after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the king

      lived at a distance from the provinces, that those great proprietors, who

      resided on their estates, would much augment their authority over their

      vassals and retainers, and over all the inhabitants of the neighborhood.

      Hence the immeasurable power assumed by Harold, Godwin, Leofric, Siward,

      Morcar, Edwin, Edric, and Alfric who controlled the authority of the

      kings, and rendered themselves quite necessary in the government. The two

      latter, though detested by the people on account of their joining a

      foreign enemy, still preserved their power and influence; and we may

      therefore conclude that their authority was founded, not on popularity,

      but on family rights and possessions. There is one Athelstan, mentioned in

      the reign of the king of that name, who is called alderman of all England,

      and is said to be half king; though the monarch himself was a prince of

      valor and abilities.[**] And we find that in the later Saxon times, and in

      these alone, the great offices went from father to sun, and became in a

      manner hereditary in the families.[A]

     

      The circumstances attending the invasions of the Danes would also serve

      much to increase the power of the principal nobility. Those freebooters

      made unexpected inroads on all quarters, and there was a necessity that

      each county should resist them by its own force, and under the conduct of

      its own nobility and its own magistrates. For the same reason that a

      general war, managed by the united efforts of the whole state commonly

      augments the power of the crown, those private wars and inroads turned to

      the advantage of the aldermen and nobles.

     

      Among that military and turbulent people, so averse to commerce and the

      arts, and so little inured to industry, justice was commonly very ill

      administered, and great oppression and violence seem to have prevailed.

      These disorders would be increased by the exorbitant power of the

      aristocracy; and would, in their turn, contribute to increase it. Men, not

      daring to rely on the guardianship of the laws, were obliged to devote

      themselves to the service of some chieftain, whose orders they followed

      even to the disturbance of the government, or the injury of their

      fellow-citizens, and who afforded them, in return, protection from any

      insult or injustice by strangers. Hence we find, by the extracts which Dr.

      Brady has given us from Domesday, that almost all the inhabitants, even of

      towns, had placed themselves under the clientship of some particular

      nobleman, whose patronage they purchased by annual payments, and whom they

      were obliged to consider as their sovereign, more than the king himself,

      or even the legislature.[B]

     

      A client, though a freeman, was supposed so much to belong to his patron,

      that his murderer was obliged by law to pay a fine to the latter, as a

      compensation for his loss; in like manner as he paid a fine to the master

      for the murder of his slave.[A] Men who were of a more considerable rank,

      but not powerful enough each to support himself by his own independent

      authority, entered into formal confederacies with each other, and composed

      a kind of separate community, which rendered itself formidable to all

      aggressors. Dr. Hickes has preserved a curious Saxon bond of this kind,

      which he calls a “sodalitium,” and which contains many particulars

      characteristical of the manners and customs of the times.[B] All the

      associates are there said to be gentlemen of Cambridgeshire; and they

      swear before the holy relics to observe their confederacy, and to be

      faithful to each other: they promise to bury any of the associates who

      dies, in whatever place he had appointed; to contribute to his funeral

      charges, and to attend to his interment; and whoever is wanting in this

      last duty, binds himself to pay a measure of honey. When any of the

      associates is in danger, and calls for the assistance of his fellows, they

      promise, besides flying to his succor, to give information to the sheriff;

      and if he be negligent in protecting the person exposed to danger, they

      engage to levy a fine of one pound upon him; if the president of the

      society himself be wanting in this particular, he binds himself to pay one

      pound; unless he has the reasonable excuse of sickness, or of duty to his

      superior. When any of the associates is murdered, they are to exact eight

      pounds from the murderer; and if he refuse to pay it, they are to

      prosecute him for the sum at their joint expense. If any of the

      associates, who happens to be poor, kill a man, the society are to

      contribute, by a certain proportion, to pay his fine,—a mark apiece,

      if the fine be seven hundred shillings; less if the person killed be a

      clown or ceorle; the half of that sum, again, if he be a Welshman But

      where any of the associates kill a man wilfully and without provocation,

      he must himself pay the fine. If any of the associates kill any of his

      fellows in a like criminal manner, besides paying the usual fine to the

      relations of the deceased, he must pay eight pounds to the society, or

      renounce the benefit of it; in which case they bind themselves, under the

      penalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with him, except in the

      presence of the king, bishop, or alderman. There are other regulations to

      protect themselves and their servants from all injuries, to revenge such

      as are committed, and to prevent their giving abusive language to each

      other; and the fine which they engage to pay for this last offence is a

      measure of honey.

     

      It is not to be doubted but a confederacy of this kind must have been a

      great source of friendship and attachment, when men lived in perpetual

      danger from enemies, robbers, and oppressors, and received protection

      chiefly from their personal valor, and from the assistance of their

      friends and patrons. As animosities were then more violent, connections

      were also more intimate, whether voluntary or derived from blood: the most

      remote degree of propinquity was regarded; an indelible memory of benefits

      was preserved; severe vengeance was taken for injuries, both from a point

      of honor and as the best means of future security; and the civil union

      being weak, many private engagements were contracted, in order to supply

      its place, and to procure men that safety, which the laws and their own

      innocence were not alone able to insure to them.

     

      On the whole, notwithstanding the seeming liberty, or rather

      licentiousness, of the Anglo-Saxons, the great body, even of the free

      citizens, in those ages, really enjoyed much less true liberty than where

      the execution of the laws is the most severe, and where subjects are

      reduced to the strictest subordination and dependence on the civil

      magistrate. The reason is derived from the excess itself of that liberty.

      Men must guard themselves at any price against insults and injuries; and

      where they receive not protection from the laws and magistrates, they will

      seek it by submission to superiors, and by herding in some private

      confederacy, which acts under the direction of a powerful leader. And thus

      all anarchy is the immediate cause of tyranny, if not over the state, at

      least over many of the individuals.

     

      Security was provided by the Saxon laws to all members of the

      wittenagemot, both in going and returning, “except they were notorious

      thieves and robbers.”

      

      The German Saxons, as the other nations of that continent, were divided

      into three ranks of men—the noble, the free, and the slaves.[A] This

      distinction they brought over with them into Britain.

     

      The nobles were called thanes; and were of two kinds, the king’s thanes

      and lesser thanes. The latter seem to have been dependent on the former,

      and to have received lands, for which they paid rent, services, or

      attendance in peace and war.[*] We know of no title which raised any one

      to the rank of thane, except noble birth and the possession of land. The

      former was always much regarded by all the German nations, even in their

      most barbarous state; and as the Saxon nobility, having little credit,

      could scarcely burden their estates with much debt, and as the commons had

      little trade or industry by which they could accumulate riches’ these two

      ranks of men, even though they were not separated by positive laws, might

      remain long distinct, and the noble families continue many ages in

      opulence and splendor. There were no middle ranks of men, that could

      gradually mix with their superiors, and insensibly procure to themselves

      honor and distinction. If, by any extraordinary accident, a mean person

      acquired riches, a circumstance so singular made him be known and

      remarked; he became the object of envy, as well as of indignation, to all

      the nobles; he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired;

      and he would find it impossible to protect himself from oppression, except

      by courting the patronage of some great chieftain, and paying a large

      price for his safety.

     

      There are two statutes among the Saxon laws, which seem calculated to

      confound those different ranks of men; that of Athelstan, by which a

      merchant, who had made three long sea voyages on his own account, was

      entitled to the quality of thane;[**] and that of the same prince, by

      which a ceorle, or husbandman, who had been able to purchase five hides of

      land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall, and a bell, was raised to the

      same distinction.[***] But the opportunities were so few, by which a

      merchant or ceorle could thus exalt himself above his rank, that the law

      could never overcome the reigning prejudices; the distinction between

      noble and base blood would still be indelible; and the well-born thanes

      would entertain the highest contempt for those legal and factitious ones.

      Though we are not informed of any of these circumstances by ancient

      historians, they are so much founded on the nature of things, that we may

      admit them as a necessary and infallible consequence of the situation of

      the kingdom during those ages.

     

      The cities appear by domesday-book to have been, at the conquest little

      better than villages.[*] York itself, though it was always the second, at

      least the third[**] city in England, and was the capital of a great

      province, which never was thoroughly united with the rest, contained then

      but one thousand four hundred and eighteen families.[***] Malmsbury tells

      us,[****] that the great distinction between the Anglo-Saxon nobility and

      the French and Norman, was, that the latter built magnificent and stately

      castles; whereas the former consumed their immense fortunes in riot and

      hospitality, and in mean houses. We may thence infer, that the arts in

      general were much less advanced in England than in France: a greater

      number of idle servants and retainers lived about the great families; and

      as these, even in France, were powerful enough to disturb the execution of

      the laws, we may judge of the authority acquired by the aristocracy in

      England. When Earl Godwin besieged the Confessor in London, he summoned

      from all parts his huscarles, or houseceorles and retainers, and thereby

      constrained his sovereign to accept of the conditions which he was pleased

      to impose upon him.

     

      The lower rank of freemen were denominated ceorles among the Anglo-Saxons;

      and where they were industrious they were chiefly employed in husbandry;

      whence a ceorle and a husbandman became in a manner synonymous terms. They

      cultivated the farms of the nobility, or thanes, for which they paid rent;

      and they seem to have been removable at pleasure; for there is little

      mention of leases among the Anglo-Saxons: the pride of the nobility,

      together with the general ignorance of writing, must have rendered those

      contracts very rare, and must have kept the husbandmen in a dependent

      condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in kind.[*****]

     

      But the most numerous rank by far in the community to have been the slaves

      or villains, who were the property of their lords, and were consequently

      incapable themselves of possessing any property. Dr. Brady assures us,

      from a survey of domesday-book,[*] that, in all the counties of England,

      the far greater part of the land was occupied by them, and that the

      husbandmen, and still more the socmen, who were tenants that, could not be

      removed at pleasure, were very few in comparison. This was not the case

      with the German nations, as far as we can collect from the account given

      us by Tacitus. The perpetual wars in the Heptarchy, and the depredations

      of the Danes, seem to have been the cause of this great alteration with

      the Anglo-Saxons. Prisoners taken in battle, or carried off in the

      frequent inroads, were then reduced to slavery, and became, by right of

      war,[**] entirely at the disposal of their lords. Great property in the

      nobles, especially if joined to an irregular administration of justice,

      naturally favors the power of the aristocracy; but still more so, if the

      practice of slavery be admitted, and has become very common. The nobility

      not only possess the influence which always attends riches, but also the

      power which the laws give them over their slaves and villains. It then

      becomes difficult, and almost impossible, for a private man to remain

      altogether free and independent.

     

      There were two kinds of slaves among the Anglo-Saxons; household slaves,

      after the manner of the ancients, and praedial, or rustic, after the

      manner of the Germans.[***] These latter resembled the serfs, which are at

      present to be met with in Poland, Denmark, and some parts of Germany. The

      power of a master over his slaves was not unlimited among the

      Anglo-Saxons, as it was among their ancestors. If a man beat out his

      slave’s eye or teeth, the slave recovered his liberty:[****] if he killed

      him, he paid a fine to the king, provided the slave died within a day

      after the wound or blow; otherwise it passed unpunished.[*****] The

      selling of themselves or children to slavery, was always the practice

      among the German nations,[******] and was continued by the

      Anglo-Saxons.[*******]

     

      The great lords and abbots among the Anglo-Saxons possessed a criminal

      jurisdiction within their territories, and could punish without appeal any

      thieves or robbers whom they caught there.[*] This institution must have

      had a very contrary effect to that which was intended, and must have

      procured robbers a sure protection on the lands of such noblemen as did

      not sincerely mean to discourage crimes and violence.

     

      But though the general strain of the Anglo-Saxon government seems to have

      become aristocratical, there were still considerable remains of the

      ancient democracy, which were not indeed sufficient to protect the lowest

      of the people, without the patronage of some great lord, but might give

      security, and even some degree of dignity, to the gentry or inferior

      nobility. The administration of justice, in particular, by the courts of

      the decennary, the hundred, and the county, was well calculated to defend

      general liberty, and to restrain the power of the nobles. In the county

      courts, or shiremotes, all the freeholders were assembled twice a year,

      and received appeals from the inferior courts. They there decided all

      causes, ecclesiastical as well as civil; and the bishop, together with the

      alderman or earl, presided over them.[**] The affair was determined in a

      summary manner, without much pleading formality, or delay, by a majority

      of voices; and the bishop and alderman had no further authority than to

      keep order among the freeholders, and interpose with their opinion.[***]

      Where justice was denied during three sessions by the hundred, and then by

      the county court, there lay an appeal to the king’s court;[****] but this

      was not practised on slight occasions. The aldermen received a third of

      the fines levied in those courts;[*****] and as most of the punishments

      were then pecuniary, this perquisite formed a considerable part of the

      profits belonging to his office. The two thirds also, which went to the

      king, made no contemptible part of the public revenue. Any free-holder was

      fined who absented himself thrice from these courts.[******]

     

      As the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and writings very rare, the

      county or hundred court was the place where the most remarkable civil

      transactions were finished, in order to preserve the memory of them, and

      prevent all future disputes. Here testaments were promulgated, slaves

      manumitted, bargains of sale concluded, and sometimes, for greater

      security, the most considerable of these deeds were inserted in the blank

      leaves of the parish Bible, which thus became a kind of register, too

      sacred to be falsified. It was not unusual to add to the deed an

      imprecation on all such as should be guilty of that crime.[*]

     

      Among a people who lived in so simple a manner as the Anglo-Saxons, the

      judicial power is always of greater importance than the legislative. There

      were few or no taxes imposed by the states; there were few statutes

      enacted; and the nation was less governed by laws, than by customs, which

      admitted a great latitude of interpretation. Though it should, therefore,

      be allowed, that the wittenagemot was altogether composed of the principal

      nobility, the county courts, where all the freeholders were admitted, and

      which regulated all the daily occurrences of life, formed a wide basis for

      the government, and were no contemptible checks on the aristocracy. But

      there is another power still more important than either the judicial or

      legislative; to wit, the power of injuring or serving by immediate force

      and violence, for which it is difficult to obtain redress in courts of

      justice. In all extensive governments, where the execution of the laws is

      feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of the principal

      nobility; and the degree of it which prevails, cannot be determined so

      much by the public statutes, as by small incidents in history, by

      particular customs, and sometimes by the reason and nature of things. The

      highlands of Scotland have long been entitled by law to every privilege of

      British subjects; but it was not till very lately that the common people

      could in fact enjoy these privileges.

     

      The powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon government are disputed

      among historians and antiquaries: the extreme obscurity of the subject,

      even though faction had never entered into the question, would naturally

      have begotten those controversies. But the great influence of the lords

      over their slaves and tenants, the clientship of the burghers, the total

      want of a middling rank of men, the extent of the mon archy, the loose

      execution of the laws, the continued disorders and convulsions of the

      state,—all these circumstances evince that the Anglo-Saxon

      government became at last extremely aristocratical; and the events, during

      the period immediately preceding the conquest, confirm this inference or

      conjecture.

     

      Both the punishments inflicted by the Anglo-Saxon courts of judicature,

      and the methods of proof employed in all causes, appear somewhat singular,

      and are very different from those which prevail at present among all

      civilized nations.

     

      We must conceive that the ancient Germans were little removed from the

      original state of nature: the social confederacy among them was more

      martial than civil: they had chiefly in view the means of attack or

      defence against public enemies, not those of protection against their

      fellow-citizens: their possessions were so slender and so equal, that they

      were not exposed to great danger; and the natural bravery of the people

      made every man trust to himself and to his particular friends for his

      defence or vengeance. This defect in the political union drew much closer

      the knot of particular confederacies: an insult upon any man was regarded

      by all his relations and associates as a common injury: they were bound by

      honor, as well as by a sense of common interest, to revenge his death, or

      any violence which he had suffered: they retaliated on the aggressor by

      like acts of violence; and if he were protected, as was natural and usual,

      by his own clan, the quarrel was spread still wider, and bred endless

      disorders in the nation.

     

      The Frisians, a tribe of the Germans, had never advanced beyond this wild

      and imperfect state of society; and the right of private revenge still

      remained among them unlimited and uncontrolled.[*] But the other German

      nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one step farther towards

      completing the political or civil union. Though it still continued to be

      an indispensable point of honor for every clan to revenge the death or

      injury of a member, the magistrate had acquired a right of interposing in

      the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference. He obliged the person

      maimed or injured, and the relations of one killed, to accept of a present

      from the aggressor and his relations,[**] as a compensation for the

      injury.[***] and to drop all farther prosecution of revenge. That the

      accommodation of one quarrel might not be the source of more, this present

      was fixed and certain according to the rank of the person killed or

      injured, and was commonly paid in cattle, the chief property of those rude

      and uncultivated nations.

     

      A present of this kind gratified the revenge of the injured family by the

      loss which the aggressor suffered: it satisfied then pride by the

      submission which it expressed: it diminished their regret for the loss or

      injury of a kinsman by their acquisition of new property; and thus general

      peace was for a moment restored to the society.[*]

     

      But when the German nations had been settled some time in the provinces of

      the Roman empire, they made still another step towards a more cultivated

      life, and their criminal justice gradually improved and refined itself.

      The magistrate, whose office it was to guard public peace, and to suppress

      private animosities, conceived himself to be injured by every injury done

      to any of his people; and besides the compensation to the person who

      suffered, or to his family, he thought himself entitled to exact a fine,

      called the “fridwit,” as an atonement for the breach of peace, and as a

      reward for the pains which he had taken in accommodating the quarrel. When

      this idea, which is so natural, was once suggested, it was willingly

      received both by sovereign and people. The numerous fines which were

      levied, augmented the revenue of the king; and the people were sensible

      that he would be more vigilant in interposing with his good offices, when

      he reaped such immediate advantage from them; and that injuries would be

      less frequent, when, besides compensation to the person injured, that they

      were exposed to this additional penalty.[**]

     

      This short abstract contains the history of the criminal jurisprudence of

      the northern nations for several centuries. The state of England in this

      particular, during the period of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the

      collection of ancient laws, published by Lambard and Wilkins. The chief

      purport of these laws is not to prevent or entirely suppress private

      quarrels, which the legislators knew to be impossible, but only to

      regulate and moderate them. The laws of Alfred enjoin, that if any one

      know that his enemy or aggressor, after doing him an injury, resolves to

      keep within his own house and his own lands[*] he shall not fight

      him, till he require compensation for the injury. If he be strong enough

      to besiege him in his house, he may do it for seven days without attacking

      him; and if the aggressor be a willing, during that time, to surrender

      himself and his arms, his, adversary may detain him thirty days, but is

      afterwards obliged to restore him safe to his kindred, “and be content

      with the compensation.” If the criminal fly to the temple, that sanctuary

      must not be violated. Where the assailant has not force sufficient to

      besiege the criminal in his house, he must apply to the alderman for

      assistance; and if the alderman refuse aid the assailant must have

      recourse to the king; and he is not allowed to assault the house till

      after this supreme magistrate has refused assistance. If any one meet with

      his enemy, and be ignorant that he was resolved to keep within his own

      lands he must, before he attack him, require him to surrender him self

      prisoner, and deliver up his arms; in which case he may detain him thirty

      days; but if he refuse to deliver up his arms it is then lawful to fight

      him. A slave may fight in his master’s quarrel: a father may fight in his

      son’s with any one except with his master.[**]

     

      It was enacted by King Ina, that no man should take revenge for an injury

      till he had first demanded compensation, and had been refused it.[***]

     

      King Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions the general misery

      occasioned by the multiplicity of private feuds and battles; and he

      establishes several expedients for remedying this grievance. He ordains

      that if any one commit murder, he may, with the assistance of his kindred,

      pay within a twelvemonth the fine of his crime; and if they abandon him,

      he shall alone sustain the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the

      murdered person: his own kindred are free from the feud, but on condition

      that they neither converse with the criminal, nor supply him with meat or

      other necessaries: if any of them, after renouncing him, receive him into

      their house, or give him assistance, they are finable to the king, and are

      involved in the feud. If the kindred of the murdered person take revenge

      on any but the criminal himself, after he is abandoned by his kindred, all

      their property is forfeited, and they are declared to be enemies to the

      king and all his friends.[*] It is also ordained that the fine for murder

      shall never be remitted by the king,[**] and that no criminal shall be

      killed who flies to the church, or any of the king’s towns;[***] and the

      king himself declares, that his house shall give no protection to

      murderers, till they have satisfied the church by their penance, and the

      kindred of the deceased by making compensation.[****] The method appointed

      for transacting this composition is found in the same law.[*****]

     

      These attempts of Edmond, to contract and diminish the feuds, were

      contrary to the ancient spirit of the northern barbarians, and were a step

      towards a more regular administration of justice. By the salic law, any

      man-night, by a public declaration, exempt himself from his family

      quarrels: but then he was considered by the law as no longer belonging to

      the family; and he was deprived of all right of succession, as the

      punishment of his cowardice.[******]

     

      The price of the king’s head, or his weregild, as it was then called, was

      by law thirty thousand thrimsas, near thirteen hundred pounds of present

      money. The price of the prince’s head was fifteen thousand thrimsas; that

      of a bishop’s or alderman’s, eight thousand; a sheriff’s, four thousand; a

      thane’s or clergyman’s, two thousand; a ceorle’s, two hundred and

      sixty-six. These prices were fixed by the laws of the Angles. By the

      Mercian law, the price of a ceorle’s head was two hundred shillings; that

      of a thane’s, six times as much; that of a king’s, six times

      more.[*******] By the laws of Kent, the price of the archbishop’s head was

      higher than that of the king’s.[********] Such respect was then paid to

      the ecclesiastics! It must be understood, that where a person was unable

      or unwilling to pay the fine, he was put out of the protection of law, and

      the kindred of the deceased had liberty to punish him as they thought

      proper.

     

      Some antiquaries [*********] have thought that these compensations were

      only given for manslaughter, not for wilful murder.

     

      But no such distinction appears in the laws; and it is contradicted by the

      practice of all the other barbarous nations,[*] by that of the ancient

      Germans,[**] and by that curious monument above mentioned of Saxon

      antiquity, preserved by Hickes. There is indeed a law of Alfred’s which

      makes wilful murder capital;[***] but this seems only to have been an

      attempt of that great legislator towards establishing a better police in

      the kingdom, and it probably remained without execution. By the laws of

      the same prince, a conspiracy against the life of the king might be

      redeemed by a fine.[****]

     

      The price of all kinds of wounds was likewise fixed by the Saxon laws: a

      wound of an inch long under the hair was paid with one shilling: one of a

      like size in the face, two shillings; thirty shillings for the loss of an

      ear; and so forth.[*****] There seems not to have been any difference

      made, according to the dignity of the person. By the laws of Ethelbert,

      any one who committed adultery with his neighbor’s wife was obliged to pay

      him a fine, and buy him another wife.[******]

     

      These institutions are not peculiar to the ancient Germans. They seem to

      be the necessary progress of criminal jurisprudence among every free

      people, where the will of the sovereign is not implicitly obeyed. We find

      them among the ancient Greeks during the time of the Trojan war.

      Compositions for murder are mentioned in Nestor’s speech to Achilles, in

      the ninth Iliad, and are called [Greek: apoinai]. The Irish, who never had

      any connections with the German nations, adopted the same practice till

      very lately; and the price of a man’s head was called among them his

      “eric;” as we learn from Sir John Davis. The same custom seems also to

      have prevailed among the Jews.[*******]

     

      Theft and robbery were frequent among the Anglo-Saxons In order to impose

      some check upon these crimes, it was ordained, that no man should sell or

      buy any thing above twenty pence value, except in open market;[********]

      and every bargain of sale must be executed before witnesses.[*********]

     

      Gangs of robbers much disturbed the peace of the country, and the law

      determined that a tribe of banditti, consisting of between seven and

      thirty-five persons, was to be called a “turma,” or troop; any greater

      company was denominated an army.[*] The punishments for this crime were

      various, but none of them capital.[**] If any man could track his stolen

      cattle into another’s ground, the latter was obliged to show the tracks

      out of it, or pay their value.[***]

     

      Rebellion, to whatever excess it was carried, was not capital but might be

      redeemed by a sum of money.[****] The legislators, knowing it impossible

      to prevent all disorders, only imposed a higher fine on breaches of the

      peace committed in the king’s court, or before an alderman or bishop. An

      ale-house, too, seems to have been considered as a privileged place; and

      any quarrels that arose there were more severely punished than else

      where.[*****]

     

      If the manner of punishing crimes among the Anglo-Saxons appear singular,

      the proofs were not less so; and were also the natural result of the

      situation of those people. Whatever we may imagine concerning the usual

      truth and sincerity of men who live in a rude and barbarous state, there

      is much more falsehood, and even perjury, among them, than among civilized

      nations: virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated

      reason, never flourishes to any degree, nor is founded on steady

      principles of honor, except where a good education becomes general; and

      where men are taught the pernicious consequences of vice, treachery, and

      immorality. Even superstition, though more prevalent among ignorant

      nations, is but a poor supply for the defects in knowledge and education;

      our European ancestors, who employed every moment the expedient of

      swearing on extraordinary crosses and relics, were less honorable in all

      engagements than their posterity, who from experience have omitted those

      ineffectual securities. This general proneness to assumed perjury was much

      increased by the usual want of discernment in judges, who could not

      discuss an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number, not weigh, the

      testimony of the witnesses,[*] Hence the ridiculous practice of obliging

      men to bring compurgators, who, as they did not pretend to know any thing

      of the fact, expressed upon oath, that they believed the person spoke

      true; and these compurgators were in some cases multiplied to the number

      of three hundred.[**] The practice also of single combat was employed by

      most nations on the continent as a remedy against false evidence;[***] and

      though it was frequently dropped, from the opposition of the clergy, it

      was continually revived, from experience of the falsehood attending the

      testimony of witnesses.[****] It became at last a species of

      jurisprudence: the cases were determined by law, in which the party might

      challenge his adversary or the witnesses, or the judge himself;[*****] and

      though these customs were absurd, they were rather an improvement on the

      methods of trial which had formerly been practised among those barbarous

      nations, and which still prevailed among the Anglo-Saxons.

     

      When any controversy about a fact became too intricate for those ignorant

      judges to unravel, they had recourse to what they called the judgment of

      God, that is, to fortune. Their methods of consulting this oracle were

      various. One of them was the decision by the cross: it was practised in

      this manner: When a person was accused of any crime, he first cleared

      himself by oath, and he was attended by eleven compurgators. He next took

      two pieces of wood, one of which was marked with the sign of the cross,

      and wrapping both up in wool, he placed them on the altar, or on some

      celebrated relic. After solemn prayers for the success of the experiment,

      a priest, or in his stead some unexperienced youth, took up one of the

      pieces of wood, and if he happened upon that which was marked with the

      figure of the cross, the person was pronounced innocent; if otherwise,

      guilty. [*] This practice, as it arose from superstition, was abolished by

      it in France.

     

      The ordeal was another established method of trial among Saxons. It was

      practised either by boiling water or red-hot iron. The former was

      appropriated to the common people; the latter to the nobility. The water

      or iron was consecrated by many prayers, masses, fastings, and

      exorcisms,[*] after which, the person accused either took up a stone sunk

      in the water[**] to a certain depth, or carried the iron to a certain

      distance; and his hand being wrapped up, and the covering sealed for three

      days, if there appeared, on examining it, no marks of burning, he was

      pronounced innocent; if otherwise, guilty.[***] The trial by cold water

      was different: the person was thrown into consecrated water; if he swam,

      he was guilty, if he sunk, innocent.[****] It is difficult for us to

      conceive how any innocent person could ever escape by the one trial, or

      any criminal be convicted by the other. But there was another usage

      admirably calculated for allowing every criminal to escape, who had

      confidence enough to try it. A consecrated cake, called a corsned, was

      produced, which if the person could swallow and digest, he was pronounced

      innocent.[******]

     

      The feudal law, if it had place at all among the Anglo-Saxons, which is

      doubtful, was not certainly extended over all the landed property, and was

      not attended with those consequences of homage, reliefs,[*******]

      wardship, marriage, and other burdens, which were inseparable from it in

      the kingdoms of the continent. As the Saxons expelled, or almost entirely

      destroyed, the ancient Britons, they planted themselves in this island on

      the same footing with their ancestors in Germany, and found no occasion

      for the feudal institutions,[********] which were calculated to maintain a

      kind of standing army, always in readiness to suppress any insurrection

      among the conquered people.

     

      The trouble and expense of defending the state in England lay equally upon

      all the land; and it was usual for every five hides to equip a man for the

      service. The “trinoda necessitas,” as it was called, or the burden of

      military expeditions, of repairing highways, and of building and

      supporting bridges, was inseparable from landed property, even though it

      belonged to the church or monasteries, unless exempted by a particular

      charter.[*] The ceorles, or husbandmen, were provided with arms, and were

      obliged to take their turn in military duty.[**] There were computed to be

      two hundred and forty-three thousand six hundred hides in England;[***]

      consequently the ordinary military force of the kingdom consisted of

      forty-eight thousand seven hundred and twenty men; though, no doubt, on

      extraordinary occasions, a greater number might be assembled. The king and

      nobility had some military tenants, who were called “sithcun-men.”[****]

      And there were some lands annexed to the office of aldermen, and to other

      offices; but these probably were not of great extent, and were possessed

      only during pleasure, as in the commencement of the feudal law in other

      countries of Europe.

     

      The revenue of the king seems to have consisted chiefly in his demesnes,

      which were large; and in the tolls and imposts which he probably levied at

      discretion on the boroughs and seaports that lay within his demesnes. He

      could not alienate any part of the crown lands, even to religious uses,

      without the consent of the states.[*****] Danegelt was a land-tax of a

      shilling a hide, imposed by the states,[******] either for payment of the

      sums exacted by the Danes, or for putting the kingdom in a posture of

      defence against those invaders.[*******]

     

      The Saxon pound, as likewise that which was coined for some centuries

      after the conquest, was near three times the weight of our present money.

      There were forty-eight shillings in the pound, and five pence in a

      shilling;[********] consequently a Saxon shilling was near a fifth heavier

      than ours, and a Saxon penny near three times as heavy.[*********]

     

      As to the value of money in those times, compared to commodities, there

      are some though not very certain, means of computation. A sheep, of the

      laws of Athelstan, was estimated at a shilling; that is, fifteen pence of

      our money. The fleece was two fifths of the value of the whole sheep,[*]

      much above its present estimation; and the reason probably was, that the

      Saxons, like the ancients, were little acquainted with any clothing but

      what was made of wool. Silk and cotton were quite unknown: linen was not

      much used. An ox was computed at six times the value of a sheep; a cow at

      four.[**] If we suppose that the cattle in that age, from the defects in

      husbandry, were not so large as they are at present in England, we may

      compute that money was then near ten times of greater value. A horse was

      valued at about thirty-six shillings of our money, or thirty Saxon

      shillings;[***] a mare a third less. A man at three pounds.[****] The

      board-wages of a child the first year was eight shillings, together with a

      cow’s pasture in summer, and an ox’s in winter.[*****] William of

      Malmsbury mentions it as a remarkably high price that William Rufus gave

      fifteen marks for a horse, or about thirty pounds of our present

      money.[******] Between the years 900 and 1000, Ednoth bought a hide of

      land for about one hundred and eighteen shillings of present

      money.[*******] This was little more than a shilling an acre, which indeed

      appears to have been the usual price, as we may learn from other

      accounts.[********] A palfrey was sold for twelve shillings about the year

      966.[*********] The value of an ox in King Ethel ed’s[** word?] time was

      between seven and eight shillings; a cow about six shillings.[*********]

      Gervas of Tilbury says, that in Henry I’s time, bread which would suffice

      a hundred men for a day was rated at three shillings, or a shilling of

      that age: for it is thought that soon after the conquest a pound sterling

      was divided into twenty shillings. A sheep was rated at a shilling, and so

      of other things in proportion. In Athelstan’s time, a ram was valued at a

      shilling, or fourpence Saxon.[**********] The tenants of Shireburn were

      obliged, at their choice, to pay either sixpence or four

      hens.[***********]

     

      About 1232, the abbot of St. Alban’s, going on a journey, hired seven

      handsome, stout horses; and agreed, if any of them died on the road, to

      pay the owner thirty shillings apiece of our present money.[*] It is to be

      remarked, that in all ancient times the raising of corn, especially wheat,

      being a species of manufactory, that commodity always bore a higher price,

      compared to cattle, than it does in our times.[**] The Saxon Chronicle

      tells us,[***] that in the reign of Edward the Confessor there was the

      most terrible famine ever known; insomuch that a quarter of wheat rose to

      sixty pennies, or fifteen shillings of our present money. Consequently, it

      was as dear as if it now cost seven pounds ten shillings. This much

      exceeds the great famine in the end of Queen Elizabeth, when a quarter of

      wheat was sold for four pounds. Money in this last period was nearly of

      the same value as in our time. These severe famines are a certain proof of

      bad husbandry.

     

      On the whole, there are three things to be considered, wherever a sum of

      money is mentioned in ancient times. First, the change of denomination, by

      which a pound has been reduced to the third part of its ancient weight in

      silver. Secondly, the change in value by the greater plenty of money,

      which has reduced the same weight of silver to ten times less value,

      compared to commodities; and consequently a pound sterling to the

      thirtieth part of the ancient value. Thirdly, the fewer people and less

      industry which were then to be found in every European kingdom. This

      circumstance made even the thirtieth part of the sum more difficult to

      levy, and caused any sum to have more than thirty times greater weight and

      influence, both abroad and at home, than in our times; in the same manner

      that a sum, a hundred thousand pounds, for instance, is at present more

      difficult to levy in a small state, such as Bavaria, and can produce

      greater effects on such a small community than on England. This last

      difference is not easy to be calculated; but, allowing that England has

      now six times more industry, and three times more people than it had at

      the conquest, and for some reigns after that period, we are upon that

      supposition to conceive, taking all circumstances together, every sum of

      money mentioned by historians, as if it were multiplied more than a

      hundred fold above a sum of the same denomination at present.

     

      In the Saxon times, land was divided equally among all the male children

      of the deceased, according to the custom of gavelkind. The practice of

      entails is to be found in those times.[*] Land was chiefly of two kinds,

      bockland, or land held by book or charter, which was regarded as full

      property, and descended to the heirs of the possessor; and folkland, or

      the land held by the ceorles and common people, who were removable at

      pleasure, and were, indeed, only tenants during the will of their lords.

     

      The first attempt which we find in England to separate the ecclesiastical

      from the civil jurisdiction, was that law of Edgar by which all disputes

      among the clergy were ordered to be carried before the bishop.[**] The

      penances were then very severe; but as a man could buy them off with

      money, or might substitute others to perform them, they lay easy upon the

      rich.[***]

     

      With regard to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons, we can say little, but

      that they were in general a rude, uncultivated people, ignorant of

      letters, unskilled in the mechanical arts, untamed to submission under law

      and government, addicted to intemperance, riot, and disorder. Their best

      quality was their military courage, which yet was not supported by

      discipline or conduct. Their want of fidelity to the prince, or to any

      trust reposed in them, appears strongly in the history of their later

      period; and their want of humanity in all their history. Even the Norman

      historians, notwithstanding the low state of the arts in their own

      country, speak of them as barbarians, when they mention the invasion made

      upon them by the duke of Normandy.[****] The conquest put the people in a

      situation of receiving slowly, from abroad, the rudiments of science and

      cultivation, and of correcting their rough and licentious manners
