During the reigns of the Lancastrian princes, the authority of parliament

      seems to have been more confirmed, and the privileges of the people more

      regarded, than during any former period; and the two preceding kings,

      though men of great spirit and abilities, abstained from such exertions of

      prerogative, as even weak princes, whose title was undisputed, were

      tempted to think they might venture upon with impunity. The long minority,

      of which there was now the prospect, encouraged still further the lords

      and commons to extend their influence; and without paying much regard to

      the verbal destination of Henry V., they assumed the power of giving a new

      arrangement to the whole administration. They declined altogether the name

      of “Regent” with regard to England: they appointed the duke of Bedford

      “protector” or “guardian” of that kingdom, a title which they supposed to

      imply less authority: they invested the duke of Glocester with the same

      dignity during the absence of his elder brother;[*] and in order to limit

      the power of both these princes, they appointed a council, without whose

      advice and approbation no measure of importance could be determined.[**]

      The person and education of the infant prince were committed to Henry

      Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, his great uncle, and the legitimated son

      of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster; a prelate who, as his family could

      never have any pretensions to the crown, might safely, they thought, be

      intrusted with that important charge.[***]

     

      The two princes, the dukes of Bedford and Glocester, who seemed injured by

      this plan of government, yet, being persons of great integrity and honor,

      acquiesced in any appointment which tended to give security to the public;

      and as the wars in France appeared to be the object of greatest moment,

      they avoided every dispute which might throw an obstacle in the way of

      foreign conquests.

     

      When the state of affairs between the English and French kings was

      considered with a superficial eye, every advantage seemed to be on the

      side of the former; and the total expulsion of Charles appeared to be an

      event which might naturally be expected from the superior power of his

      competitor. Though Henry was yet in his infancy, the administration was

      devolved on the duke of Bedford, the most accomplished prince of his age;

      whose experience, prudence, valor, and generosity qualified him for his

      high office, and enabled him both to maintain union among his friends, and

      to gain the confidence of his enemies. The whole power of England was at

      his command; he was at the head of armies inured to victory; he was

      seconded by the most renowned generals of the age, the earls of Somerset,

      Warwick, Salisbury, Suffolk, and Arundel, Sir John Talbot, and Sir John

      Fastolffe: and besides Guienne, the ancient inheritance of England, he was

      master of the capital, and of almost all the northern provinces, which

      were well enabled to furnish him with supplies both of men and money, and

      to assist and support his English forces.

     

      But Charles, notwithstanding the present inferiority of his power,

      possessed some advantages, derived partly from his situation, partly from

      his personal character, which promised him success, and served, first to

      control, then to overbalance, the superior force and opulence of his

      enemies. He was the true and undoubted heir of the monarchy: all

      Frenchmen, who knew the interests, or desired the independence, of their

      country, turned their eyes towards him as its sole resource; the exclusion

      given him by the imbecility of his father, and the forced or precipitate

      consent of the states, had plainly no validity: that spirit of faction

      which had blinded the people, could not long hold them in so gross a

      delusion: their national and inveterate hatred against the English, the

      authors of all their calamities, must soon revive, and inspire them with

      indignation at bending their necks under the yoke of that hostile people:

      great nobles and princes, accustomed to maintain an independence against

      their native sovereigns, would never endure a subjection to strangers; and

      though most of the princes of the blood were, since the fatal battle of

      Azincour detained prisoners in England, the inhabitants of their de

      mesnes, their friends their vassals, all declared a zealous attachment to

      the king and exerted themselves in resisting the violence of foreign

      invaders.

     

      Charles himself, though only in his twentieth year, was of a character

      well calculated to become the object of these benevolent sentiments; and

      perhaps from the favor which naturally attends youth, was the more likely,

      on account of his tender age, to acquire the good-will of his native

      subjects. He was a prince of the most friendly and benign disposition, of

      easy and familiar manners, and of a just and sound, though not a very

      vigorous understanding. Sincere, generous, affable, he engaged from

      affection the services of his followers, even while his low fortunes might

      make it their interest to desert him; and the lenity of his temper could

      pardon in them those sallies of discontent, to which princes in his

      situation are so frequently exposed. The love of pleasure often seduced

      him into indolence; but amidst all his irregularities, the goodness of his

      heart still shone forth; and by exerting at intervals his courage and

      activity, he proved that his general remissness proceeded not from the

      want either of a just spirit of ambition, or of personal valor.

     

      Though the virtues of this amiable prince lay some time in obscurity, the

      duke of Bedford knew that his title alone made him formidable, and that

      every foreign assistance would be requisite, ere an English regent could

      hope to complete the conquest of France; an enterprise which, however it

      might seem to be much advanced, was still exposed to many and great

      difficulties. The chief circumstance which had procured to the English all

      their present advantages, was the resentment of the duke of Burgundy

      against Charles; and as that prince seemed intent rather on gratifying his

      passion than consulting his interests, it was the more easy for the

      regent, by demonstrations of respect and confidence, to retain him in the

      alliance of England. He bent, therefore, all his endeavors to that

      purpose: he gave the duke every proof of friendship and regard: he even

      offered him the regency of France, which Philip declined: and that he

      might corroborate national connections by private ties, he concluded his

      own marriage with the princess of Burgundy, which had been stipulated by

      the treaty of Arras.

     

      1423.

     

      Being sensible that, next to the alliance of Burgundy, the friendship of

      the duke of Brittany was of the greatest importance towards forwarding the

      English conquests; and that, as the provinces of France, already subdued,

      lay between the dominions of these two princes, he could never hope for

      any security without preserving his connections with them; he was very

      intent on strengthening himself also from that quarter. The duke of

      Brittany, having received many just reasons of displeasure from the

      ministers of Charles, had already acceded to the treaty of Troye, and had,

      with other vassals of the crown, done homage to Henry V. in quality of

      heir to the kingdom: but as the regent knew that the duke was much

      governed by his brother, the count of Richemont, he endeavored to fix his

      friendship, by paying court and doing services to this haughty and

      ambitious prince.

     

      Arthur, count of Richemont, had been taken prisoner at the battle of

      Azincour, had been treated with great indulgence by the late king, and had

      even been permitted on his parole to take a journey into Brittany, where

      the state of affairs required his presence. The death of that victorious

      monarch happened before Richemont’s return; and this prince pretended

      that, as his word was given personally to Henry V., he was not bound to

      fulfil it towards his son and successor; a chicane which the regent, as he

      could not force him to compliance, deemed it prudent to overlook. An

      interview was settled at Amiens between the dukes of Bedford, Burgundy,

      and Brittany, at which the count of Richemont was also present:[*] the

      alliance was renewed between these princes: and the regent persuaded

      Philip to give in marriage to Richemont his eldest sister, widow of the

      deceased dauphin, Lewis, the elder brother of Charles. Thus Arthur was

      connected both with the regent and the duke of Burgundy, and seemed

      engaged by interest to prosecute the same object, in forwarding the

      success of the English arms.

     

      While the vigilance of the duke of Bedford was employed in gaining or

      confirming these allies, whose vicinity rendered them so important, he did

      not overlook the state of more remote countries. The duke of Albany,

      regent of Scotland, had died: and his power had devolved on Murdac, his

      son, a prince of a weak understanding and indolent disposition; who, far

      from possessing the talents requisite for the government of that fierce

      people, was not even able to maintain authority in his own family, or

      restrain the petulance and insolence of his sons. The ardor of the Scots

      to serve in France, where Charles treated them with great honor and

      distinction, and where the regent’s brother enjoyed the dignity of

      constable, broke out afresh under this feeble administration: new succors

      daily came over, and filled the armies of the French king: the earl of

      Douglas conducted a reÃ«nforcement of five thousand men to his assistance:

      and it was justly to be dreaded that the Scots, by commencing open

      hostilities in the north, would occasion a diversion still more

      considerable of the English power, and would ease Charles, in part, of

      that load by which he was at present so grievously oppressed. The duke of

      Bedford, therefore, persuaded the English council to form an alliance with

      James, their prisoner; to free that prince from his long captivity; and to

      connect him with England by marrying him to a daughter of the earl of

      Somerset, and cousin of the young king.[*] As the Scottish regent, tired

      of his present dignity, which he was not able to support, was now become

      entirely sincere in his applications for James’s liberty, the treaty was

      soon concluded; a ransom of forty thousand pounds was stipulated;[**] and

      the king of Scots was restored to the throne of his ancestors, and proved,

      in his short reign, one of the most illustrious princes that had ever

      governed that kingdom. He was murdered, in 1437, by his traitorous kinsman

      the earl of Athole. His affections inclined to the side of France; but the

      English had never reason during his lifetime to complain of any breach of

      the neutrality by Scotland.

     

      But the regent was not so much employed in these political negotiations as

      to neglect the operations of war, from which alone he could hope to

      succeed in expelling the French monarch. Though the chief seat of

      Charles’s power lay in the southern provinces beyond the Loire, his

      partisans were possessed of some fortresses in the northern, and even in

      the neighborhood of Paris; and it behoved the duke of Bedford first to

      clear these countries from the enemy, before he could think of attempting

      more distant conquests. The Castle of Dorsoy was taken after a siege of

      six weeks: that of Noyelle and the town of Rue, in Picardy, underwent the

      same fate: Pont sur Seine, Vertus, Montaigu, were subjected by the English

      arms: and a more considerable advantage was soon after gained by the

      united forces of England and Burgundy. John Stuart, constable of Scotland,

      and the lord of Estissac had formed the siege of Crevant, in Burgundy: the

      earls of Salisbury and Suffolk, with the count of Toulongeon, were sent to

      its relief: a fierce and well-disputed action ensued; the Scots and French

      were defeated: the constable of Scotland and the count of Ventadour were

      taken prisoners; and above a thousand men, among whom was Sir William

      Hamilton, were left on the field of battle.[*] The taking of Gaillon upon

      the Seine, and of La CharitÃ© upon the Loire, was the fruit of this

      victory: and as this latter place opened an entrance into the southern

      provinces, the acquisition of it appeared on that account of the greater

      importance to the duke of Bedford, and seemed to promise a successful

      issue to the war.

     

      1424.

     

      The more Charles was threatened with an invasion in those provinces which

      adhered to him, the more necessary it became that he should retain

      possession of every fortress which he still held within the quarters of

      the enemy. The duke of Bedford had besieged in person, during the space of

      three months, the town of Yvri, in Normandy: and the brave governor,

      unable to make any longer defence, was obliged to capitulate; and he

      agreed to surrender the town, if, before a certain term, no relief

      arrived. Charles, informed of these conditions, determined to make an

      attempt for saving the place. He collected, with some difficulty, an army

      of fourteen thousand men, of whom one half were Scots; and he sent them

      thither under the command of the earl of Buchan, constable of France; who

      was attended by the earl of Douglas, his countryman, the duke of AlenÃ§on,

      the mareschal de la Fayette, the count of Aumale, and the viscount of

      Narbonne. When the constable arrived within a few leagues of Yvri, he

      found that he was come too late, and that the place was already

      surrendered. He immediately turned to the left, and sat down before

      Verneuil, which the inhabitants, in spite of the garrison, delivered up to

      him.[*] Buchan might now have returned in safety, and with the glory of

      making an acquisition no less important than the place which he was sent

      to relieve: but hearing of Bedford’s approach, he called a council of war,

      in order to deliberate concerning the conduct which he should hold in this

      emergence.

     

      The wiser part of the council declared for a retreat; and represented,

      that all the past misfortunes of the French had proceeded from their

      rashness in giving battle when no necessity obliged them; that this army

      was the last resource of the king, and the only defence of the few

      provinces which remained to him; and that every reason invited him to

      embrace cautious measures, which might leave time for his subjects to

      return to a sense of their duty, and give leisure for discord to arise

      among his enemies, who, being united by no common bond of interest or

      motive of alliance, could not long persevere in their animosity against

      him. All these prudential considerations were overborne by a vain point of

      honor, not to turn their backs to the enemy; and they resolved to await

      the arrival of the duke of Bedford.

     

      The numbers were nearly equal in this action; and as the long continuance

      of war had introduced discipline, which, however imperfect, sufficed to

      maintain some appearance of order in such small armies, the battle was

      fierce, and well disputed, and attended with bloodshed on both sides. The

      constable drew up his forces under the walls of Verneuil, and resolved to

      abide the attack of the enemy: but the impatience of the viscount of

      Narbonne, who advanced precipitately, and obliged the whole line to follow

      him in some hurry and confusion, was the cause of the misfortune which

      ensued. The English archers, fixing their palisadoes before them,

      according to their usual custom, sent a volley of arrows amidst the

      thickest of the French army; and though beaten from their ground, and

      obliged to take shelter among the baggage, they soon rallied, and

      continued to do great execution upon the enemy. The duke of Bedford,

      meanwhile, at the head of the men at arms, made impression on the French,

      broke their ranks, chased them off the field, and rendered the victory

      entirely complete and decisive.[*]

     

      The constable himself perished in battle as well as the earl of Douglas

      and his son, the counts of Aumale, Tonnerre, and Ventadour, with many

      other considerable nobility. The duke of AlenÃ§on, the mareschal de la

      Fayette, the lords of Gaucour and Mortemar, were taken prisoners. There

      fell about four thousand of the French, and sixteen hundred of the

      English; a loss esteemed, at that time, so unusual on the side of the

      victors, that the duke of Bedford forbade all rejoicings for his success,

      Verneuil was surrendered next day by capitulation.[*]

     

      The condition of the king of France now appeared very terrible, and almost

      desperate. He had lost the flower of his army and the bravest of his

      nobles in this fatal action: he had no resource either for recruiting or

      subsisting his troops; he wanted money even for his personal subsistence;

      and though all parade of a court was banished, it was with difficulty he

      could keep a table, supplied with the plainest necessaries, for himself

      and his few followers: every day brought him intelligence of some loss or

      misfortune: towns which were bravely defended, were obliged at last to

      surrender for want of relief or supply: he saw his partisans entirely

      chased from all the provinces which lay north of the Loire: and he

      expected soon to lose, by the united efforts of his enemies, all the

      territories of which he had hitherto continued master; when an incident

      happened which saved him on the brink of ruin, and lost the English such

      an opportunity for completing their conquests, as they never afterwards

      were able to recall.

     

      Jacqueline, countess of Hainault and Holland, and heir of these provinces,

      had espoused John, duke of Brabant cousin-german to the duke of Burgundy;

      but having made this choice from the usual motives of princes, she soon

      found reason to repent of the unequal alliance. She was a princess of a

      masculine spirit and uncommon understanding: the duke of Brabant was of a

      sickly complexion and weak mind: she was in the vigor of her age; he had

      only reached his fifteenth year: these causes had inspired her with such

      contempt for her husband, which soon proceeded to antipathy that she

      determined to dissolve a marriage, where, it is probable, nothing but the

      ceremony had as yet intervened. The court of Rome was commonly very open

      to applications of this nature, when seconded by power and money; but as

      the princess foresaw great opposition from her husband’s relations, and

      was impatient to effect her purpose, she made her escape into England, and

      threw herself under the protection of the duke of Glocester. That prince,

      with many noble qualities had the defect of being governed by an impetuous

      temper and vehement passions; and he was rashly induced, as well by the

      charms of the countess herself, as by the prospect of possessing her rich

      inheritance, to offer himself to her as a husband. Without waiting for a

      papal dispensation; without endeavoring to reconcile the duke of Burgundy

      to the measure; he entered into a contract of marriage with Jaqueline, and

      immediately attempted to put himself in possession of her dominions.

      Philip was disgusted with so precipitate a conduct: he resented the injury

      done to the duke of Brabant, his near relation: he dreaded to have the

      English established on all sides of him: and he foresaw the consequences

      which must attend the extensive and uncontrolled dominion of that nation,

      if, before the full settlement of their power, they insulted and injured

      an ally to whom they had already been so much indebted, and who was still

      so necessary for supporting them in their further progress. He encouraged,

      therefore, the duke of Brabant to make resistance: he engaged many of

      Jaqueline’s subjects to adhere to that prince: he himself marched troops

      to his support: and as the duke of Glocester still persevered in his

      purpose, a sharp war was suddenly kindled in the Low Countries. The

      quarrel soon became personal as well as political. The English prince

      wrote to the duke of Burgundy, complaining of the opposition made to his

      pretensions; and though, in the main, he employed amicable terms in his

      letter, he took notice of some falsehoods into which, he said, Philip had

      been betrayed during the course of these transactions. This unguarded

      expression was highly resented: the duke of Burgundy insisted that he

      should retract it; and mutual challenges and defiances passed between them

      on this occasion.[*]

     

      The duke of Bedford could easily foresee the bad effects of so ill-timed

      and imprudent a quarrel. All the succors which he expected from England,

      and which were so necessary in this critical emergence, were intercepted

      by his brother, and employed in Holland and Hainault: the forces of the

      duke of Burgundy, which he also depended on, were diverted by the same

      wars: and besides this double loss, he was in imminent danger of

      alienating forever that confederate whose friendship was of the utmost

      importance, and whom the late king had enjoined him, with his dying

      breath, to gratify by every mark of regard and attachment. He represented

      all these topics to the duke of Glocester: he endeavored to mitigate the

      resentment of the duke of Burgundy: he interposed with his good offices

      between these princes, but was not successful in any of his endeavors; and

      he found that the impetuosity of his brother’s temper was still the chief

      obstacle to all accommodation.[*] For this reason, instead of pushing the

      victory gained at Verneuil, he found himself obliged to take a journey

      into England, and to try, by his counsels and authority, to moderate the

      measures of the duke of Glocester.

     

      There had likewise broken out some differences among the English ministry,

      which had proceeded to great extremities, and which required the regent’s

      presence to compose them.[**] The bishop of Winchester, to whom the care

      of the king’s person and education had been intrusted, was a prelate of

      great capacity and experience, but of an intriguing and dangerous

      character; and as he aspired to the government of affairs, he had

      continual disputes with his nephew the protector; and he gained frequent

      advantages over the vehement and impolitic temper of that prince.

     

      1425.

     

      The duke of Bedford employed the authority of parliament to reconcile

      them; and these rivals were obliged to promise, before that assembly, that

      they would bury all quarrels in oblivion.[***] Time also seemed to open

      expedients for composing the difference with the duke of Burgundy. The

      credit of that prince had procured a bull from the pope; by which not only

      Jaqueline’s contract with the duke of Glocester was annulled, but it was

      also declared that, even in case of the duke of Brabant’s death, it should

      never be lawful for her to espouse the English prince. Humphrey,

      despairing of success, married another lady of inferior rank, who had

      lived some time with him as his mistress.[****]

     

      The duke of Brabant died; and his widow, before she could recover

      possession of her dominions, was obliged to declare the duke of Burgundy

      her heir, in case she should die without issue, and to promise never to

      marry without his consent. But though the affair was thus terminated to

      the satisfaction of Philip, it left a disagreeable impression on his mind:

      it excited an extreme jealousy of the English, and opened his eyes to his

      true interests: and as nothing but his animosity against Charles had

      engaged him in alliance with them, it counterbalanced that passion by

      another of the same kind, which in the end became prevalent, and brought

      him back, by degrees, to his natural connections with his family and his

      native country.

     

      About the same time, the duke of Brittany began to withdraw himself from

      the English alliance. His brother, the count of Richemont, though

      connected by marriage with the dukes of Burgundy and Bedford, was

      extremely attached by inclination to the French interest; and he willingly

      hearkened to all the advances which Charles made him for obtaining his

      friendship. The staff of constable, vacant by the earl of Buchan’s death,

      was offered him; and as his martial and ambitious temper aspired to the

      command of armies, which he had in vain attempted to obtain from the duke

      of Bedford, he not only accepted that office, but brought over his brother

      to an alliance with the French monarch. The new constable, having made

      this one change in his measures, firmly adhered ever after to his

      engagements with France. Though his pride and violence, which would admit

      of no rival in his master’s confidence, and even prompted him to

      assassinate the other favorites, had so much disgusted Charles, that he

      once banished him the court, and refused to admit him to his presence, he

      still acted with vigor for the service of that monarch, and obtained at

      last, by his perseverance, the pardon of all past offences.

     

      1426.

     

      In this situation, the duke of Bedford, on his return, found the affairs

      of France, after passing eight months in England. The duke of Burgundy was

      much disgusted. The duke of Brittany had entered into engagements with

      Charles, and had done homage to that prince for his duchy. The French had

      been allowed to recover from the astonishment into which their frequent

      disasters had thrown them. An incident too had happened, which served

      extremely to raise their courage. The earl of Warwick had besieged

      Montargis with a small army of three thousand men, and the place was

      reduced to extremity, when the bastard of Orleans undertook to throw

      relief into it. This general, who was natural son to the prince

      assassinated by the duke of Burgundy, and who was afterwards created count

      of Dunois, conducted a body of one thousand six hundred men to Montargis,

      and made an attack on the enemy’s trenches with so much valor, prudence,

      and good fortune, that he not only penetrated into the place, but gave a

      severe blow to the English, and obliged Warwick to raise the siege.[*]

      This was the first signal action that raised the fame of Dunois, and

      opened him the road to those great honors which he afterwards attained.

     

      But the regent, soon after his arrival, revived the reputation of the

      English arms by an important enterprise which he happily achieved. He

      secretly brought together, in separate detachments, a considerable army to

      the frontiers of Brittany; and fell so unexpectedly upon that province,

      that the duke, unable to make resistance, yielded to all the terms

      required of him. he renounced the French alliance; he engaged to maintain

      the treaty of Troye; he acknowledged the duke of Bedford for regent of

      France; and promised to do homage for his duchy to King Henry.[**] And the

      English prince, having thus freed himself from a dangerous enemy who lay

      behind him, resolved on an undertaking, which, if successful, would, he

      hoped, cast the balance between the two nations, and prepare the way for

      the final conquest of France.

     

      1428.

     

      The city of Orleans was so situated between the provinces commanded by

      Henry, and those possessed by Charles, that it opened an easy entrance to

      either; and as the duke of Bedford intended to make a great effort for

      penetrating into the south of France, it behoved him to begin with this

      place, which, in the present circumstances, was become the most important

      in the kingdom. He committed the conduct of the enterprise to the earl of

      Salisbury, who had newly brought him a reÃ«nforcement of six thousand men

      from England, and who had much distinguished himself by his abilities

      during the course of the present war. Salisbury, passing the Loire, made

      himself master of several small places, which surrounded Orleans on that

      side;[***] and as his intentions were thereby known, the French king used

      every expedient to supply the city with a garrison and provisions, and

      enable it to maintain a long and obstinate siege.

     

      The lord of Gaucour, a brave and experienced captain, was appointed

      governor: many officers of distinction threw themselves into the place:

      the troops which they conducted were inured to war, and were determined to

      make the most obstinate resistance: and even the inhabitants, disciplined

      by the long continuance of hostilities, were well qualified, in their own

      defence, to second the efforts of the most veteran forces. The eyes of all

      Europe were turned towards this scene; where, it was reasonably supposed,

      the French were to make their last stand for maintaining the independence

      of their monarchy, and the rights of their sovereign.

     

      The earl of Salisbury at last approached the place with an army, which

      consisted only of ten thousand men; and not being able, with so small a

      force, to invest so great a city, that commanded a bridge over the Loire,

      he stationed himself on the southern side towards Sologne, leaving the

      other, towards the Beausse, still open to the enemy. He there attacked the

      fortifications which guarded the entrance to the bridge; and, after an

      obstinate resistance, he carried several of them; but was himself killed

      by a cannon ball as he was taking a view of the enemy.[*]

     

      The earl of Suffolk succeeded to the command; and being reÃ«nforced with

      great numbers of English and Burgundians, he passed the river with the

      main body of his army, and invested Orleans on the other side. As it was

      now the depth of winter, Suffolk, who found it difficult, in that season,

      to throw up intrenchments all around, contented himself, for the present,

      with erecting redoubts at different distances, where his men were lodged

      in safety, and were ready to intercept the supplies which the enemy might

      attempt to throw into the place. Though he had several pieces of artillery

      in his camp, (and this is among the first sieges in Europe where cannon

      were found to be of importance,) the art of engineering was hitherto so

      imperfect, that Suffolk trusted more to famine than to force for subduing

      the city; and he purposed in the spring to render the circumvallation more

      complete, by drawing intrenchments from one redoubt to another. Numberless

      feats of valor were performed both by the besiegers and besieged during

      the winter: bold sallies were made, and repulsed with equal boldness:

      convoys were sometimes introduced, and often intercepted: the supplies

      were still unequal to the consumption of the place: and the English seemed

      daily, though slowly, to be advancing towards the completion of their

      enterprise.

     

      1429.

     

      But while Suffolk lay in this situation, the French parties ravaged all

      the country around; and the besiegers, who were obliged to draw their

      provisions from a distance were themselves exposed to the danger of want

      and famine. Sir John Fastolffe was bringing up a large convoy of even kind

      of stores, which he escorted with a detachment of two thousand five

      hundred men; when he was attacked by a body of four thousand French, under

      the command of the counts of Clermont and Dunois. Fastolffe drew up his

      troops behind the wagons; but the French generals, afraid of attacking him

      in that posture, planted a battery of cannon against him; which threw

      every thing into confusion, and would have insured them the victory, had

      not the impatience of some Scottish troops, who broke the line of battle,

      brought on an engagement, in which Fastolffe was victorious. The count of

      Dunois was wounded; and about five hundred French were left on the field

      of battle. This action, which was of great importance in the present

      conjuncture, was commonly called the battle of Herrings; because the

      convoy brought a great quantity of that kind of provisions, for the use of

      the English army during the Lent season.[*]

     

      Charles seemed now to have but one expedient for saving this city, which

      had been so long invested. The duke of Orleans, who was still prisoner in

      England, prevailed on the protector and the council to consent that all

      his demesnes should be allowed to preserve a neutrality during the war,

      and should be sequestered, for greater security, into the hands of the

      duke of Burgundy. This prince, who was much less cordial in the English

      interests than formerly, went to Paris, and made the proposal to the duke

      of Bedford; but the regent coldly replied, that he was not of a humor to

      beat the bushes while others ran away with the game; an answer which so

      disgusted the duke, that he recalled all the troops of Burgundy that acted

      in the siege.[**]

     

      This place, however, was every day more and more closely invested by the

      English: great scarcity began already to be felt by the garrison and

      inhabitants: Charles, in despair of collecting an army which should dare

      to approach the enemy’s intrenchments, not only gave the city for lost,

      but began to entertain a very dismal prospect with regard to the general

      state of his affairs. He saw that the country in which he had hitherto

      with great difficulty subsisted, would be laid entirely open to the

      invasion of a powerful and victorious enemy; and he already entertained

      thoughts of retiring with the remains of his forces into Languedoc and

      Dauphiny, and defending himself as long as possible in those remote

      provinces. But it was fortunate for this good prince that, as he lay under

      the dominion of the fair, the women whom he consulted had the spirit to

      support his sinking resolution in this desperate extremity. Mary of Anjou,

      his queen, a princess of great merit and prudence, vehemently opposed this

      measure, which, she foresaw, would discourage all his partisans, and serve

      as a general signal for deserting a prince who seemed himself to despair

      of success. His mistress too, the fair Agnes Sorel, who lived in entire

      amity with the queen, seconded all her remonstrances, and threatened that,

      if he thus pusillanimously threw away the sceptre of France, she would

      seek in the court of England a fortune more correspondent to her wishes.

      Love was able to rouse in the breast of Charles that courage which

      ambition had failed to excite: he resolved to dispute every inch of ground

      with an imperious enemy, and rather to perish with honor in the midst of

      his friends, than yield ingloriously to his bad fortune; when relief was

      unexpectedly brought him by another female of a very different character,

      who gave rise to one of the most singular revolutions that is to be met

      with in history.

     

      In the village of Domremi, near Vaucouleurs, on the borders of Lorraine,

      there lived a country girl of twenty-seven years of age, called Joan

      d’Arc, who was servant in a small inn, and who in that station had been

      accustomed to tend the horses of the guests, to ride them without a saddle

      to the watering-place, and to perform other offices which, in well

      frequented inns, commonly fall to the share of the men servants.[*]

     

      This girl was of an irreproachable life, and had not hitherto been

      remarked for any singularity; whether that she had met with no occasion to

      excite her genius, or that the unskilful eyes of those who conversed with

      her had not been able to discern her uncommon merit. It is easy to

      imagine, that the present situation of France was an interesting object

      even to persons of the lowest rank, and would become the frequent subject

      of conversation: a young prince, expelled his throne by the sedition of

      native subjects, and by the arms of strangers, could not fail to move the

      compassion of all his people whose hearts were uncorrupted by faction; and

      the peculiar character of Charles, so strongly inclined to friendship and

      the tender passions, naturally rendered him the hero of that sex whose

      generous minds know no bounds in their affections. The siege of Orleans,

      the progress of the English before that place, the great distress of the

      garrison and inhabitants, the importance of saving this city and its brave

      defenders, had turned thither the public eye; and Joan, inflamed by the

      general sentiment, was seized with a wild desire of bringing relief to her

      sovereign in his present distresses. Her unexperienced mind, working day

      and night on this favorite object, mistook the impulses of passion for

      heavenly inspirations; and she fancied that she saw visions, and heard

      voices, exhorting her to reÃ«stablish the throne of France, and to expel

      the foreign invaders. An uncommon intrepidity of temper made her overlook

      all the dangers which might attend her in such a path; and thinking

      herself destined by Heaven to this office, she threw aside all that

      bashfulness and timidity so natural to her sex, her years, and her low

      station. She went to Vaucouleurs; procured admission to Baudricourt, the

      governor; informed him of her inspirations and intentions; and conjured

      him not to neglect the voice of God, who spoke through her, but to second

      those heavenly revelations which impelled her to this glorious enterprise.

      Baudricourt treated her at first with some neglect; but on her frequent

      returns to him, and importunate solicitations, he began to remark

      something extraordinary in the maid, and was inclined, at all hazards, to

      make so easy an experiment. It is uncertain whether this gentleman had

      discernment enough to perceive, that great use might be made with the

      vulgar of so uncommon an engine; or, what is more likely in that credulous

      age, was himself a convert to this visionary; but he adopted at last the

      schemes of Joan; and he gave her some attendants, who conducted her to the

      French court, which at that time resided at Chinon.

     

      It is the business of history to distinguish between the miraculous and

      the marvellous; to reject the first in all narrations merely profane and

      human; to doubt the second; and when obliged by unquestionable testimony,

      as in the present case, to admit of something extraordinary, to receive as

      little of it as is consistent with the known facts and circumstances. It

      is pretended, that Joan, immediately on her admission, knew the king,

      though she had never seen his face before, and though he purposely kept

      himself in the crowd of courtiers, and had laid aside every thing in his

      dress and apparel which might distinguish him: that she offered him, in

      the name of the supreme Creator, to raise the siege of Orleans, and

      conduct him to Rheims to be there crowned and anointed; and on his

      expressing doubts of her mission, revealed to him, before some sworn

      confidants, a secret which was unknown to all the world beside himself,

      and which nothing but a heavenly inspiration could have discovered to her:

      and that she demanded, as the instrument of her future victories, a

      particular sword, which was kept in the church of St. Catharine of

      Fierbois, and which, though she had never seen it, she described by all

      its marks, and by the place in which it had long lain neglected.[*] This

      is certain, that all these miraculous stories were spread abroad, in order

      to captivate the vulgar. The more the king and his ministers were

      determined to give into the illusion, the more scruples they pretended. An

      assembly of grave doctors and theologians cautiously examined Joan’s

      mission, and pronounced it undoubted and supernatural. She was sent to the

      parliament, then residing at Poictiers; and was interrogated before that

      assembly: the presidents, the counsellors, who came persuaded of her

      imposture, went away convinced of her inspiration. A ray of hope began to

      break through that despair in which the minds of all men were before

      enveloped. Heaven had now declared itself in favor of France, and had laid

      bare its outstretched arm to take vengeance on her invaders. Few could

      distinguish between the impulse of inclination and the force of

      conviction; and none would submit to the trouble of so disagreeable a

      scrutiny.

     

      After these artificial precautions and preparations had been for some time

      employed, Joan’s requests were at last complied with: she was armed

      cap-Ã -pie, mounted on horseback, and shown in that martial habiliment

      before the whole people. Her dexterity in managing her steed, though

      acquired in her former occupation, was regarded as a fresh proof of her

      mission; and she was received with the loudest acclamations by the

      spectators. Her former occupation was even denied: she was no longer the

      servant of an inn. She was converted into a shepherdess, an employment

      much more agreeable to the imagination. To render her still more

      interesting, near ten years were subtracted from her age; and all the

      sentiments of love and of chivalry were thus united to those of

      enthusiasm, in order to inflame the fond fancy of the people with

      prepossessions in her favor.

     

      When the engine was thus dressed up in full splendor, it was determined to

      essay its force against the enemy. Joan was sent to Blois, where a large

      convoy was prepared for the supply of Orleans, and an army of ten thousand

      men, under the command of St. Severe, assembled to escort it. She ordered

      all the soldiers to confess themselves before they set out on the

      enterprise: she banished from the camp all women of bad fame: she

      displayed in her hands a consecrated banner, where the Supreme Being was

      represented, grasping the globe or earth, and surrounded with flower de

      luces. And she insisted, in right of her prophetic mission, that the

      convoy should enter Orleans by the direct road from the side of Beausse:

      but the count of Dunois, unwilling to submit the rules of the military art

      to her inspirations, ordered it to approach by the other side of the

      river, where he knew the weakest part of the English army was stationed.

     

      Previous to this attempt, the maid had written to the regent, and to the

      English generals before Orleans, commanding them, in the name of the

      omnipotent Creator, by whom she was commissioned, immediately to raise the

      siege; and to evacuate France; and menacing them with divine vengeance in

      case of their disobedience. All the English affected to speak with

      derision of the maid, and of her heavenly commission; and said, that the

      French king was now indeed reduced to a sorry pass, when he had recourse

      to such ridiculous expedients: but they felt their imagination secretly

      struck with the vehement persuasion which prevailed in all around them;

      and they waited with an anxious expectation, not unmixed with horror, for

      the issue of these extraordinary preparations.

     

      As the convoy approached the river, a sally was made by the garrison on

      the side of Beausse, to prevent the English general from sending any

      detachment to the other side: the provisions were peaceably embarked in

      boats, which the inhabitants of Orleans had sent to receive them: the maid

      covered with her troops the embarkation: Suffolk did not venture to attack

      her: and the French general carried back the army in safety to Blois; an

      alteration of affairs which was already visible to all the world, and

      which had a proportional effect on the minds of both parties.

     

      The maid entered the city of Orleans, arrayed in her military garb, and

      displaying her consecrated standard; and was received as a celestial

      deliverer by all the inhabitants. They now believed themselves invincible

      under her influence; and Dunois himself, perceiving such a mighty

      alteration both in friends and foes, consented, that the next convoy,

      which was expected in a few days, should enter by the side of Beausse. The

      convoy approached: no sign of resistance appeared in the besiegers: the

      wagons and troops passed without interruption between the redoubts of the

      English: a dead silence and astonishment reigned among those troops,

      formerly so elated with victory, and so fierce for the combat.

     

      The earl of Suffolk was in a situation very unusual and extraordinary, and

      which might well confound the man of the greatest capacity and firmest

      temper. He saw his troops overawed, and strongly impressed with the idea

      of a divine influence accompanying the maid. Instead of banishing these

      vain terrors by hurry, and action, and war, he waited till the soldiers

      should recover from the panic; and he thereby gave leisure for those

      prepossessions to sink still deeper into their minds. The military maxims

      which are prudent in common cases, deceived him in these unaccountable

      events. The English felt their courage daunted and overwhelmed; and thence

      inferred a divine vengeance hanging over them. The French drew the same

      inference from an inactivity so new and unexpected. Every circumstance was

      now reversed in the opinions of men, on which all depends: the spirit

      resulting from a long course of uninterrupted success, was on a sudden

      transferred from the victors to the vanquished.

     

      The maid called aloud, that the garrison should remain no longer on the

      defensive; and she promised her followers the assistance of Heaven in

      attacking those redoubts of the enemy which had so long kept them in awe,

      and which they had never hitherto dared to insult. The generals seconded

      her ardor: an attack was made on one redoubt, and it proved successful:[*]

      all the English who defended the intrenchments were put to the sword or

      taken prisoners: and Sir John Talbot himself, who had drawn together, from

      the other redoubts, some troops to bring them relief, durst not appear in

      the open field against so formidable an enemy.

     

      Nothing, after this success, seemed impossible to the maid and her

      enthusiastic votaries. She urged the generals to attack the main body of

      the English in their intrenchments, but Dunois, still unwilling to hazard

      the fate of France by too great temerity, and sensible that the least

      reverse of fortune would make all the present visions evaporate, and

      restore every thing to its former condition, checked her vehemence and

      proposed to her first to expel the enemy from their forts on the other

      side of the river, and thus lay the communication with the country

      entirely open, before she attempted any more hazardous enterprise. Joan

      was persuaded, and these forts were vigorously assailed. In one attack the

      French were repulsed; the maid was left almost alone; she was obliged to

      retreat, and join the runaways; but, displaying her sacred standard, and

      animating them with her countenance, her gestures, her exhortations, she

      led them back to the charge, and overpowered the English in their

      intrenchments. In the attack of another fort, she was wounded in the neck

      with an arrow; she retreated a moment behind the assailants; she pulled

      out the arrow with her own hands; she had the wound quickly dressed; and

      she hastened back to head the troops, and to plant her victorious banner

      on the ramparts of the enemy.

     

      By all these successes, the English were entirely chased from their

      fortifications on that side: they had lost above six thousand men in these

      different actions; and, what was still more important, their wonted

      courage and confidence were wholly gone, and had given place to amazement

      and despair. The maid returned triumphant over the bridge, and was again

      received as the guardian angel of the city. After performing such

      miracles, she convinced the most obdurate incredulity of her divine

      mission: men felt themselves animated as by a superior energy, and thought

      nothing impossible to that divine hand which so visibly conducted them. It

      was in vain even for the English generals to oppose with their soldiers

      the prevailing opinion of supernatural influence: they themselves were

      probably moved by the same belief: the utmost they dared to advance was,

      that Joan was not an instrument of God; she was only the implement of the

      devil: but as the English had felt, to their sad experience, that the

      devil might be allowed sometimes to prevail, they derived not much

      consolation from the enforcing of this opinion.

     

      It might prove extremely dangerous for Suffolk, with such intimidated

      troops, to remain any longer in the presence of so courageous and

      victorious an enemy; he therefore raised the siege, and retreated with all

      the precaution imaginable. The French resolved to push their conquests,

      and to allow the English no leisure to recover from their consternation.

      Charles formed a body of six thousand men, and sent them to attack

      Jergeau, whither Suffolk had retired with a detachment of his army. The

      siege lasted ten days; and the place was obstinately defended. Joan

      displayed her wonted intrepidity on the occasion. She descended into the

      fosse, in leading the attack: and she there received a blow on the head

      with a stone, by which she was confounded and beaten to the ground: but

      she soon recovered herself, and in the end rendered the assault

      successful: Suffolk was obliged to yield himself prisoner to a Frenchman

      called Renaud; but before he submitted, he asked his adversary whether he

      were a gentleman. On receiving a satisfactory answer, he demanded whether

      he were a knight. Renaud replied, that he had not yet attained that honor.

      “Then I make you one,” replied Suffolk; upon which he gave him the blow

      with his sword which dubbed him into that fraternity; and he immediately

      surrendered himself his prisoner.

     

      The remainder of the English army was commanded by Fastolffe, Scales, and

      Talbot, who thought of nothing but of making their retreat, as soon as

      possible, into a place of safety; while the French esteemed the overtaking

      them equivalent to a victory; so much had the events which passed before

      Orleans altered every thing between the two nations! The vanguard of the

      French under Richemont and Xaintrailles attacked the rear of the enemy at

      the village of Patay. The battle lasted not a moment: the English were

      discomfited and fled: the brave Fastolffe himself showed the example of

      flight to his troops; and the order of the garter was taken from him, as a

      punishment for this instance of cowardice.[*] Two thousand men were killed

      in this action, and both Talbot and Scales taken prisoners.

     

      In the account of all these successes, the French writers, to magnify the

      wonder, represent the maid (who was now known by the appellation of “the

      Maid of Orleans”) as not only active in combat, but as performing the

      office of general; directing the troops, conducting the military

      operations, and swaying the deliberations in all councils of war. It is

      certain that the policy of the French court endeavored to maintain this

      appearance with the public: but it is much more probable, that Dunois and

      the wiser commanders prompted her in all her measures, than that a country

      girl, without experience of education, could on a sudden become expert in

      a profession which requires more genius and capacity than any other active

      scene of life. It is sufficient praise, that she could distinguish the

      persons on whose judgment she might rely; that she could seize their hints

      and suggestions, and on a sudden, deliver their opinions as her own; and

      that she could curb, on occasion, that visionary and enthusiastic spirit

      with which she was actuated, and could temper it with prudence and

      discretion.

     

      The raising of the siege of Orleans was one part of the maid’s promise to

      Charles: the crowning of him at Rheims was the other: and she now

      vehemently insisted that he should forthwith set out on that enterprise. A

      few weeks before, such a proposal would have appeared the most extravagant

      in the world. Rheims lay in a distant quarter of the kingdom; was then in

      the hands of a victorious enemy; the whole road which led to it was

      occupied by their garrisons; and no man could be so sanguine as to imagine

      that such an attempt could so soon come within the bounds of possibility.

      But as it was extremely the interest of Charles to maintain the belief of

      something extraordinary and divine in these events, and to avail himself

      of the present consternation of the English, he resolved to follow the

      exhortations of his warlike prophetess, and to lead his army upon this

      promising adventure. Hitherto he had kept remote from the scene of war: as

      the safety of the state depended upon his person, he had been persuaded to

      restrain his military ardor: but observing this prosperous turn of

      affairs, he now determined to appear at the head of his armies, and to set

      the example of valor to all his soldiers, And the French nobility saw at

      once their young sovereign assuming a new and more brilliant character,

      seconded by fortune, and conducted by the hand of Heaven, and they caught

      fresh zeal to exert themselves in replacing him on the throne of his

      ancestors.

     

      Charles set out for Rheims at the head of twelve thousand men: he passed

      by Troye, which opened its gates to him; Chalons imitated the example:

      Rheims sent him a deputation with its keys, before his approach to it: and

      he scarcely perceived, as he passed along, that he was marching through an

      enemy’s country. The ceremony of his coronation was here performed[*] with

      the holy oil, which a pigeon had brought to King Clovis from heaven, on

      the first establishment of the French monarchy: the maid of Orleans stood

      by his side in complete armor, and displayed her sacred banner, which had

      so often dissipated and confounded his fiercest enemies: and the people

      shouted with the most unfeigned joy, on viewing such a complication of

      wonders. After the completion of the ceremony, the maid threw herself at

      the king’s feet, embraced his knees, and with a flood of tears, which

      pleasure and tenderness extorted from her, she congratulated him on this

      singular and marvellous event.

     

      Charles, thus crowned and anointed, became more respectable in the eyes of

      all his subjects, and seemed, in a manner, to receive anew, from a

      heavenly commission, his title to their allegiance. The inclinations of

      men swaying their belief, no one doubted of the inspirations and prophetic

      spirit of the maid: so many incidents which passed all human

      comprehension, left little room to question a superior influence: and the

      real and undoubted facts brought credit to every exaggeration, which could

      scarcely be rendered more wonderful. Laon, Soissons, Chateau-Thierri,

      Provins, and many other towns and fortresses in that neighborhood,

      immediately after Charles’s coronation, submitted to him on the first

      summons; and the whole nation was disposed to give him the most zealous

      testimonies of their duty and affection.

     

      Nothing can impress us with a higher idea of the wisdom, address, and

      resolution of the duke of Bedford, than his being able to maintain himself

      in so perilous a situation, and to preserve some footing in France, after

      the defection of so many places, and amidst the universal inclination of

      the rest to imitate that contagious example. This prince seemed present

      every where by his vigilance and foresight: he employed every resource

      which fortune had yet left him: he put all the English garrisons in a

      posture of defence: he kept a watchful eye over every attempt among the

      French towards an insurrection: he retained the Parisians in obedience, by

      alternately employing caresses and severity: and knowing that the duke of

      Burgundy was already wavering in his fidelity, he acted with so much skill

      and prudence, as to renew, in this dangerous crisis, his alliance with

      that prince; an alliance of the utmost importance to the credit and

      support of the English government.

     

      The small supplies which he received from England set the talents of this

      great man in a still stronger light. The ardor of the English for foreign

      conquests was now extremely abated by time and reflection: the parliament

      seems even to have become sensible of the danger which might attend their

      further progress: no supply of money could be obtained by the regent

      during his greatest distresses: and men enlisted slowly under his

      standard, or soon deserted, by reason of the wonderful accounts which had

      reached England, of the magic and sorcery, and diabolical power of the

      maid of Orleans.[*] It happened fortunately, in this emergency, that the

      bishop of Winchester, now created a cardinal, landed at Calais with a body

      of five thousand men, which he was conducting into Bohemia, on a crusade

      against the Hussites. He was persuaded to lend these troops to his nephew

      during the present difficulties;[**] and the regent was thereby enabled to

      take the field, and to oppose the French king, who was advancing with his

      army to the gates of Paris.

     

      The extraordinary capacity of the duke of Bedford appeared also in his

      military operations. He attempted to restore the courage of his troops by

      boldly advancing to the face of the enemy; but he chose his posts with so

      much caution, as always to decline a combat, and to render it impossible

      for Charles to attack him. He still attended that prince in all his

      movements; covered his own towns and garrisons; and kept himself in a

      posture to reap advantage from every imprudence or false step of the

      enemy. The French army, which consisted mostly of volunteers, who served

      at their own expense, soon after retired and was disbanded: Charles went

      to Bourges, the ordinary place of his residence; but not till he made

      himself master of Compiegne, Beauvais, Senlis, Sens, Laval, Lagni, St.

      Denis, and of many places in the neighborhood of Paris, which the

      affections of the people had put into his hands.

     

      1430.

     

      The regent endeavored to revive the declining state of his affairs, by

      bringing over the young king of England, and having him crowned and

      anointed at Paris,[***] All the vassals of the crown who lived within the

      provinces possessed by the English, swore anew allegiance, and did homage

      to him.

     

      But this ceremony was cold and insipid, compared with the lustre which had

      attended the coronation of Charles at Rheims; and the duke of Bedford

      expected more effect from an accident, which put into his hands the person

      that had been the author of all his calamities.

     

      The maid of Orleans, after the coronation of Charles, declared to the

      count of Dunois that her wishes were now fully gratified, and that she had

      no further desire than to return to her former condition, and to the

      occupation and course of life which became her sex: but that nobleman,

      sensible of the great advantages which might still be reaped from her

      presence in the army, exhorted her to persevere, till, by the final

      expulsion of the English, she had brought all her prophecies to their full

      completion. In pursuance of this advice, she threw herself into the town

      of Compiegne, which was at that time besieged by the duke of Burgundy,

      assisted by the earls of Arundel and Suffolk; and the garrison, on her

      appearance, believed themselves thenceforth invincible. But their joy was

      of short duration. The maid, next day after her arrival, headed a sally

      upon the quarters of John of Luxembourg; she twice drove the enemy from

      their intrenchments; finding their numbers to increase every moment, she

      ordered a retreat; when hard pressed by the pursuers, she turned upon

      them, and made them again recoil; but being here deserted by her friends,

      and surrounded by the enemy, she was at last, after exerting the utmost

      valor, taken prisoner by the Burgundians.[*] The common opinion was, that

      the French officers, finding the merit of every victory ascribed to her,

      had, in envy to her renown, by which they were themselves so much

      eclipsed, willingly exposed her to this fatal accident.

     

      The envy of her friends, on this occasion, was not a greater proof of her

      merit than the triumph of her enemies. A complete victory would not have

      given more joy to the English and their partisans. The service of Te Deum,

      which has so often been profaned by princes, was publicly celebrated on

      this fortunate event at Paris. The duke of Bedford fancied that, by the

      captivity of that extraordinary woman, who had blasted all his successes,

      he should again recover his former ascendant over France; and to push

      farther the present advantage, he purchased the captive from John of

      Luxembourg, and formed a prosecution against her, which, whether it

      proceeded from vengeance or policy, was equally barbarous and

      dishonorable.

     

      1431.

     

      There was no possible reason why Joan should not be regarded as a prisoner

      of war, and be entitled to all the courtesy and good usage which civilized

      nations practise towards enemies on these occasions. She had never, in her

      military capacity, forfeited, by any act of treachery or cruelty, her

      claim to that treatment: she was unstained by any civil crime: even the

      virtues and the very decorums of her sex had ever been rigidly observed by

      her: and though her appearing in war, and leading armies to battle, may

      seem an exception, she had thereby performed such signal service to her

      prince, that she had abundantly compensated for this irregularity; and

      was, on that very account, the more an object of praise and admiration. It

      was necessary, therefore, for the duke of Bedford to interest religion

      some way in the prosecution, and to cover under that cloak his violation

      of justice and humanity.

     

 ENLARGE
 

      The bishop of Beauvais, a man wholly devoted to the English interests,

      presented a petition against Joan, on pretence that she was taken within

      the bounds of his diocese; and he desired to have her tried by an

      ecclesiastical court for sorcery, impiety, idolatry, and magic: the

      university of Paris was so mean as to join in the same request: several

      prelates, among whom the cardinal of Winchester was the only Englishman,

      were appointed her judges: they held their court in Rouen, where the young

      king of England then resided: and the maid, clothed in her former military

      apparel, but loaded with irons, was produced before this tribunal.

     

      She first desired to be eased of her chains: her judges answered, that she

      had once already attempted an escape by throwing herself from a tower: she

      confessed the fact, maintained the justice of her intention, and owned

      that, if she could, she would still execute that purpose. All her other

      speeches showed the same firmness and intrepidity: though harassed with

      interrogatories during the course of near four months, she never betrayed

      any weakness or womanish submission; and no advantage was gained over her.

      The point which her judges pushed most vehemently, was her visions and

      revelations, and intercourse with departed saints; and they asked her,

      whether she would submit to the church the truth of these inspirations:

      she replied, that she would submit them to God, the fountain of truth.

      They then exclaimed, that she was a heretic, and denied the authority of

      the church. She appealed to the pope: they rejected her appeal.

     

      They asked her, why she put trust in her standard, which had been

      consecrated by magical incantations: she replied that she put trust in the

      Supreme Being alone, whose image was impressed upon it. They demanded, why

      she carried in her hand that standard at the anointment and coronation of

      Charles at Rheims: she answered, that the person who had shared the danger

      was entitled to share the glory. When accused of going to war, contrary to

      the decorums of her sex, and of assuming government and command over men,

      she scrupled not to reply, that her sole purpose was to defeat the

      English, and to expel them the kingdom. In the issue, she was condemned

      for all the crimes of which she had been accused, aggravated by heresy;

      her revelations were declared to be inventions of the devil to delude the

      people; and she was sentenced to be delivered over to the secular arm.

     

      Joan, so long surrounded by inveterate enemies, who treated her with every

      mark of contumely; browbeaten and overawed by men of superior rank, and

      men invested with the ensigns of a sacred character, which she had been

      accustomed to revere, felt her spirit at last subdued; and those visionary

      dreams of inspiration, in which she had been buoyed up by the triumphs of

      success and the applauses of her own party, gave way to the terrors of

      that punishment to which she was sentenced. She publicly declared herself

      willing to recant: she acknowledged the illusion of those revelations

      which the church had rejected; and she promised never more to maintain

      them. Her sentence was then mitigated: she was condemned to perpetual

      imprisonment, and to be fed during life on bread and water.

     

      Enough was now done to fulfil all political views, and to convince both

      the French and the English, that the opinion of divine influence, which

      had so much encouraged the one and daunted the other, was entirely without

      foundation. But the barbarous vengeance of Joan’s enemies was not

      satisfied with this victory. Suspecting that the female dress, which she

      had now consented to wear, was disagreeable to her, they purposely placed

      in her apartment a suit of men’s apparel; and watched for the effects of

      that temptation upon her. On the sight of a dress in which she had

      acquired so much renown, and which, she once believed, she wore by the

      particular appointment of Heaven, all her former ideas and passions

      revived; and she ventured in her solitude to clothe herself again in the

      forbidden garment. Her insidious enemies caught her in that situation: her

      fault was interpreted to be no less than a relapse into heresy: no

      recantation would now suffice; and no pardon could be granted her. She was

      condemned to be burned in the market-place of Rouen; and the infamous

      sentence was accordingly executed. This admirable heroine, to whom the

      more generous superstition of the ancients would have erected altars, was,

      on pretence of heresy and magic, delivered over alive to the flames, and

      expiated, by that dreadful punishment, the signal services which she had

      rendered to her prince and to her native country.

     

      1432.

     

      The affairs of the English, far from being advanced by this execution,

      went every day more and more to decay: the great abilities of the regent

      were unable to resist the strong inclination which had seized the French

      to return under the obedience of their rightful sovereign, and which that

      act of cruelty was ill fitted to remove. Chartres was surprised, by a

      stratagem of the count of Dunois: a body of the English, under Lord

      Willoughby, was defeated at St. Celerin upon the Sarte:[*] the fair in the

      suburbs of Caen, seated in the midst of the English territories, was

      pillaged by De Lore, a French officer: the duke of Bedford himself was

      obliged by Dunois to raise the siege of Lagni with some loss of

      reputation: and all these misfortunes, though light, yet being continued

      and uninterrupted, brought discredit on the English, and menaced them with

      an approaching revolution. But the chief detriment which the regent

      sustained, was by the death of his duchess, who had hitherto preserved

      some appearance of friendship between him and her brother, the duke of

      Burgundy:[**] and his marriage, soon afterwards, with Jaqueline of

      Luxembourg, was the beginning of a breach between them.[***] Philip

      complained, that the regent had never had the civility to inform him of

      his intentions, and that so sudden a marriage was a slight on his sister’s

      memory.

     

      The cardinal of Winchester meditated a reconciliation between these

      princes, and brought both of them to St. Omers for that purpose. The duke

      of Bedford here expected the first visit, both as he was son, brother, and

      uncle to a king, and because he had already made such advances as to come

      into the duke of Burgundy’s territories, in order to have an interview

      with him: but Philip, proud of his great power and independent dominions,

      refused to pay this compliment to the regent; and the two princes, unable

      to adjust the ceremonial, parted without seeing each other.[*] A bad

      prognostic of their cordial intentions to renew past amity!

     

      Nothing could be more repugnant to the interests of the house of Burgundy,

      than to unite the crowns of France and England on the same head; an event

      which, had it taken place, would have reduced the duke to the rank of a

      petty prince, and have rendered his situation entirely dependent and

      precarious. The title also to the crown of France, which, after the

      failure of the elder branches, might accrue to the duke or his posterity,

      had been sacrificed by the treaty of Troye; and strangers and enemies were

      thereby irrevocably fixed upon the throne. Revenge alone had carried

      Philip into these impolitic measures; and a point of honor had hitherto

      induced him to maintain them. But as it is the nature of passion gradually

      to decay, while the sense of interest maintains a permanent influence and

      authority, the duke had, for some years, appeared sensibly to relent in

      his animosity against Charles, and to hearken willingly to the apologies

      made by that prince for the murder of the late duke of Burgundy. His

      extreme youth was pleaded in his favor; his incapacity to judge for

      himself; the ascendant gained over him by his ministers; and his inability

      to resent a deed which, without his knowledge, had been perpetrated by

      those under whose guidance he was then placed. The more to flatter the

      pride of Philip, the king of France had banished from his court and

      presence Tanegui de Chatel, and all those who were concerned in that

      assassination; and had offered to make every other atonement which could

      be required of him. The distress which Charles had already suffered, had

      tended to gratify the duke’s revenge; the miseries to which France had

      been so long exposed, had begun to move his compassion; and the cries of

      all Europe admonished him, that his resentment, which might hitherto be

      deemed pious, would, if carried further, be universally condemned as

      barbarous and unrelenting. While the duke was in this disposition, every

      disgust which he received from England made a double impression upon him;

      the entreaties of the count of Richemont and the duke of Bourbon, who had

      married his two sisters, had weight; and he finally determined to unite

      himself to the royal family of France, from which his own was descended.

     

      1435.

     

      For this purpose, a congress was appointed at Arras under the mediation of

      deputies from the pope and the council of Basle: the duke of Burgundy came

      thither in person: the duke of Bourbon, the count of Richemont, and other

      persons of high rank, appeared as ambassadors from France: and the English

      having also been invited to attend, the cardinal of Winchester, the

      bishops of Norwich and St. David’s, the earls of Huntingdon and Suffolk,

      with others, received from the protector and council a commission for that

      purpose.[*]

     

      The conferences were held in the abbey of St. Vaast, and began with

      discussing the proposals of the two crowns which were so wide of each

      other as to admit of no hopes of accommodation. France offered to cede

      Normandy with Guienne, but both of them loaded with the usual homage and

      vassalage to the crown. As the claims of England upon France were

      universally unpopular in Europe, the mediators declared the offers of

      Charles very reasonable, and the cardinal of Winchester, with the other

      English ambassadors, without giving a particular detail of their demands,

      immediately left the congress. There remained nothing but to discuss the

      mutual pretensions of Charles and Philip. These were easily adjusted: the

      vassal was in a situation to give law to his superior; and he exacted

      conditions which, had it not been for the present necessity, would have

      been deemed, to the last degree, dishonorable and disadvantageous to the

      crown of France. Besides making repeated atonements and acknowledgments

      for the murder of the duke of Burgundy, Charles was obliged to cede all

      the towns of Picardy which lay between the Somme and the Low Countries; he

      yielded several other territories; he agreed that these and all the other

      dominions of Philip should be held by him, during his life, without doing

      any homage, or swearing fealty to the present king; and he freed his

      subjects from all obligations to allegiance, if ever he infringed this

      treaty.[**] Such were the conditions upon which France purchased the

      friendship of the duke of Burgundy.

     

      The duke sent a herald to England with a letter, in which he notified the

      conclusion of the treaty of Arras, and apologized for his departure from

      that of Troye. The council received the herald with great coldness: they

      even assigned him his lodgings in a shoemaker’s house, by way of insult;

      and the populace were so incensed, that if the duke of Glocester had not

      given him guards, his life had been exposed to danger when he appeared in

      the streets. The Flemings, and other subjects of Philip, were insulted,

      and some of them murdered by the Londoners; and every thing seemed to tend

      towards a rupture between the two nations.[*] These violences were not

      disagreeable to the duke of Burgundy; as they afforded him a pretence for

      the further measures which he intended to take against the English, whom

      he now regarded as implacable and dangerous enemies.

     

      A few days after the duke of Bedford received intelligence of this treaty,

      so fatal to the interests of England, he died at Rouen; a prince of great

      abilities, and of many virtues; and whose memory, except from the

      barbarous execution of the maid of Orleans, was unsullied by any

      considerable blemish. Isabella, queen of France, died a little before him,

      despised by the English, detested by the French, and reduced, in her

      latter years, to regard with an unnatural horror the progress and success

      of her own son, in recovering possession of his kingdom. This period was

      also signalized by the death of the earl of Arundel,[**] a great English

      general, who, though he commanded three thousand men, was foiled by

      Xaintrailles at the head of six hundred, and soon after expired of the

      wounds which he received in the action.

     

      1436

     

      The violent factions which prevailed between the duke of Glocester and the

      cardinal of Winchester, prevented the English from taking the proper

      measures for repairing these multiplied losses, and threw all their

      affairs into confusion. The popularity of the duke, and his near relation

      to the crown, gave him advantages in the contest, which he often lost by

      his open and unguarded temper, unfit to struggle with the politic and

      interested spirit of his rival. The balance, meanwhile, of these parties,

      kept every thing in suspense; foreign affairs were much neglected; and

      though the duke of York, son to that earl of Cambridge who was executed in

      the beginning of the last reign, was appointed successor to the duke of

      Bedford, it was seven months before his commission passed the seals; and

      the English remained so long in an enemy’s country, without a proper head

      or governor.

     

      The new governor, on his arrival, found the capital already lost. The

      Parisians had always been more attached to the Burgundian than to the

      English interest; and after the conclusion of the treaty of Arras, their

      affections, without any further control, universally led them to return to

      their allegiance under their native sovereign. The constable, together

      with Lile-Adam, the same person who had before put Paris into the hands of

      the duke of Burgundy, was introduced in the night-time by intelligence

      with the citizens: Lord Willoughby, who commanded only a small garrison of

      fifteen hundred men, was expelled: this nobleman discovered valor and

      presence of mind on the occasion; but unable to guard so large a place

      against such multitudes, he retired into the Bastile, and being there

      invested, he delivered up that fortress, and was contented to stipulate

      for the safe retreat of his troops into Normandy.[*]

     

      In the same season, the duke of Burgundy openly took part against England,

      and commenced hostilities by the siege of Calais, the only place which now

      gave the English any sure hold of France, and still rendered them

      dangerous. As he was beloved among his own subjects, and had acquired the

      epithet of Good, from his popular qualities, he was able to interest all

      the inhabitants of the Low Countries in the success of this enterprise;

      and he invested that place with an army formidable from its numbers, but

      without experience, discipline, or military spirit.[**] On the first alarm

      of this siege, the duke of Glocester assembled some forces, sent a

      defiance to Philip, and challenged him to wait the event of a battle,

      which he promised to give, as soon as the wind would permit him to reach

      Calais. The warlike genius of the English had at that time rendered them

      terrible to all the northern parts of Europe; especially to the Flemings,

      who were more expert in manufactures than in arms; and the duke of

      Burgundy, being already foiled in some attempts before Calais, and

      observing the discontent and terror of his own army, thought proper to

      raise the siege, and to retreat before the arrival of the enemy.[***]

     

      The English were still masters of many fine provinces in France; but

      retained possession more by the extreme weakness of Charles, than by the

      strength of their own garrisons or the force of their armies. Nothing,

      indeed, can be more surprising than the feeble efforts made, during the

      course of several years, by these two potent nations against each other

      while the one struggled for independence, and the other aspired to a total

      conquest of its rival. The general want of industry, commerce, and police

      in that age, had rendered all the European nations, and France and England

      no less than the others, unfit for bearing the burdens of war, when it was

      prolonged beyond one season; and the continuance of hostilities had, long

      ere this time, exhausted the force and patience of both kingdoms. Scarcely

      could the appearance of an army be brought into the field on either side;

      and all the operations consisted in the surprisal of places, in the

      rencounter of detached parties, and in incursions upon the open country;

      which were performed by small bodies, assembled on a sudden from the

      neighboring garrisons. In this method of conducting the war, the French

      king had much the advantage: the affections of the people were entirely on

      his side: intelligence was early brought him of the state and motions of

      the enemy: the inhabitants were ready to join in any attempts against the

      garrisons: and thus ground was continually, though slowly, gained upon the

      English. The duke of York, who was a prince of abilities, struggled

      against these difficulties during the course of five years; and being

      assisted by the valor of Lord Talbot, soon after created earl of

      Shrewsbury, he performed actions which acquired him honor, but merit not

      the attention of posterity. It would have been well, had this feeble war,

      in sparing the blood of the people, prevented likewise all other

      oppressions; and had the fury of men, which reason and justice cannot

      restrain, thus happily received a check from their impotence and

      inability. But the French and English, though they exerted such small

      force, were, however, stretching beyond their resources, which were still

      smaller; and the troops, destitute of pay, were obliged to subsist by

      plundering and oppressing the country, both of friends and enemies. The

      fields in all the north of France, which was the seat of war, were laid

      waste and left uncultivated.[*]

     

      1440.

     

      The cities were gradually depopulated, not by the blood spilt in battle,

      but by the more destructive pillage of the garrisons;[*] and both parties,

      weary of hostilities which decided nothing, seemed at last desirous of

      peace, and they set on foot negotiations for that purpose. But the

      proposals of France, and the demands of England, were still so wide of

      each other, that all hope of accommodation immediately vanished. The

      English ambassadors demanded restitution of all the provinces which had

      once been annexed to England, together with the final cession of Calais

      and its district; and required the possession of these extensive

      territories without the burden of any fealty or homage on the part of

      their prince: the French offered only part of Guienne, part of Normandy,

      and Calais, loaded with the usual burdens. It appeared in vain to continue

      the negotiation while there was so little prospect of agreement. The

      English were still too haughty to stoop from the vast hopes which they had

      formerly entertained, and to accept of terms more suitable to the present

      condition of the two kingdoms.

     

      The duke of York soon after resigned his government to the earl of

      Warwick, a nobleman of reputation, whom death prevented from long enjoying

      this dignity. The duke, upon the demise of that nobleman, returned to his

      charge; and during his administration, a truce was concluded between the

      king of England and the duke of Burgundy, which had become necessary for

      the commercial interests of their subjects.[**] The war with France

      continued in the same languid and feeble state as before.

     

      The captivity of five princes of the blood, taken prisoners in the battle

      of Azincour, was a considerable advantage, which England long enjoyed over

      its enemy; but this superiority was now entirely lost. Some of these

      princes had died; some had been ransomed; and the duke of Orleans, the

      most powerful among them, was the last that remained in the hands of the

      English. He offered the sum of fifty-four thousand nobles[***] for his

      liberty; and when this proposal was laid before the council of England, as

      every question was there an object of faction, the party of the duke of

      Glocester, and that of the cardinal of Winchester, were divided in their

      sentiments with regard to it.

     

      The duke reminded the council of the dying advice of the late king, that

      none of these prisoners should on any account be released, till his son

      should be of sufficient age to hold himself the reins of government. The

      cardinal insisted on the greatness of the sum offered, which, in reality,

      was nearly equal to two thirds of all the extraordinary supplies that the

      parliament, during the course of seven years, granted for the support of

      the war. And he added, that the release of this prince was more likely to

      be advantageous than prejudicial to the English interests; by filling the

      court of France with faction, and giving a head to those numerous

      malecontents whom Charles was at present able with great difficulty to

      restrain. The cardinal’s party, as usual, prevailed: the duke of Orleans

      was released, after a melancholy captivity of twenty-five years:[*] and

      the duke of Burgundy, as a pledge of his entire reconciliation with the

      family of Orleans, facilitated to that prince the payment of his ransom.

      It must be confessed, that the princes and nobility, in those ages, went

      to war on very disadvantageous terms. If they were taken prisoners, they

      either remained in captivity during life, or purchased their liberty at

      the price which the victors were pleased to impose, and which often

      reduced their families to want and beggary.

     

      1443.

     

      The sentiments of the cardinal, some time after, prevailed in another

      point of still greater moment. That prelate had always encouraged every

      proposal of accommodation with France; and had represented the utter

      impossibility, in the present circumstances, of pushing farther the

      conquests in that kingdom, and the great difficulty of even maintaining

      those which were already made. He insisted on the extreme reluctance of

      the parliament to grant supplies; the disorders in which the English

      affairs in Normandy were involved; the daily progress made by the French

      king; and the advantage of stopping his hand by a temporary accommodation

      which might leave room for time and accidents to operate in favor of the

      English. The duke of Glocester, high-spirited and haughty, and educated in

      the lofty pretensions which the first successes of his two brothers had

      rendered familiar to him, could not yet be induced to relinquish all hopes

      of prevailing over France; much less could he see with patience his own

      opinion thwarted and rejected by the influence of his rival in the English

      council. But, notwithstanding his opposition, the earl of Suffolk, a

      nobleman who adhered to the cardinal’s party, was despatched to Tours, in

      order to negotiate with the French ministers. It was found impossible to

      adjust the terms of a lasting peace; but a truce for twenty-two months was

      concluded, which left every thing on the present footing between the

      parties. The numerous disorders under which the French government labored,

      and which time alone could remedy, induced Charles to assent to this

      truce; and the same motives engaged him afterwards to prolong it.[*] But

      Suffolk, not content with executing this object of his commission,

      proceeded also to finish another business, which seems rather to have been

      implied than expressed in the powers that had been granted him.[**]

     

      In proportion as Henry advanced in years, his character became fully known

      in the court, and was no longer ambiguous to either faction. Of the most

      harmless, inoffensive, simple manners, but of the most slender capacity,

      he was fitted, both by the softness of his temper and the weakness of his

      understanding, to be perpetually governed by those who surrounded him; and

      it was easy to foresee that his reign would prove a perpetual minority. As

      he had now reached the twenty-third year of his age, it was natural to

      think of choosing him a queen; and each party was ambitious of having him

      receive one from their hand, as it was probable that this circumstance

      would decide forever the victory between them. The duke of Glocester

      proposed a daughter of the count of Armagnac; but had not credit to effect

      his purpose. The cardinal and his friends had cast their eye on Margaret

      of Anjou, daughter of Regnier, titular king of Sicily, Naples, and

      Jerusalem, descended from the count of Anjou, brother of Charles V., who

      had left these magnificent titles, but without any real power or

      possessions, to his posterity. This princess herself was the most

      accomplished of her age, both in body and mind; and seemed to possess

      those qualities which would equally qualify her to acquire the ascendant

      over Henry, and to supply all his defects and weaknesses. Of a masculine,

      courageous spirit, of an enterprising temper, endowed with solidity as

      well as vivacity of understanding, she had not been able to conceal these

      great talents even in the privacy of her father’s family; and it was

      reasonable to expect, that when she should mount the throne, they would

      break out with still superior lustre. The earl of Suffolk, therefore, in

      concert with his associates of the English council, made proposals of

      marriage to Margaret, which were accepted. But this nobleman, besides

      preoccupying the princess’s favor by being the chief means of her

      advancement, endeavored to ingratiate himself with her and her family, by

      very extraordinary concessions: though Margaret brought no dowry with her,

      he ventured of himself, without any direct authority from the council, but

      probably with the approbation of the cardinal and the ruling members, to

      engage, by a secret article, that the province of Maine, which was at that

      time in the hands of the English, should be ceded to Charles of Anjou, her

      uncle,[*] who was prime minister and favorite of the French king, and who

      had already received from his master the grant of that province as his

      appanage.

     

      The treaty of marriage was ratified in England: Suffolk obtained first the

      title of marquis, then that of duke; and even received the thanks of

      parliament for his services in concluding it.[**] The princess fell

      immediately into close connections with the cardinal and his party, the

      dukes of Somerset, Suffolk, and Buckingham;[***] who, fortified by her

      powerful patronage, resolved on the final ruin of the duke of Glocester.

     

      1447.

     

      This generous prince, worsted in all court intrigues, for which his temper

      was not suited, but possessing in a high degree the favor of the public,

      had already received from his rivals a cruel mortification, which he had

      hitherto borne without violating public peace, but which it was impossible

      that a person of his spirit and humanity could ever forgive. His duchess,

      the daughter of Reginald Lord Cobham, had been accused of the crime of

      witchcraft; and it was pretended, that there was found in her possession a

      waxen figure of the king, which she and her associates, Sir Roger

      Bolingbroke, a priest, and one Margery Jordan, of Eye, melted in a magical

      manner before a slow fire, with an intention of making Henry’s force and

      vigor waste away by like insensible degrees. The accusation was well

      calculated to affect the weak and credulous mind of the king, and to gain

      belief in an ignorant age; and the duchess was brought to trial with her

      confederates. The nature of this crime, so opposite to all common sense,

      seems always to exempt the accusers from observing the rules of common

      sense in their evidence: the prisoners were pronounced guilty; the duchess

      was condemned to do public penance, and to suffer perpetual imprisonment;

      the others were executed.[*] But as these violent proceedings were

      ascribed solely to the malice of the duke’s enemies, the people, contrary

      to their usual practice in such marvellous trials, acquitted the unhappy

      sufferers; and increased their esteem and affection towards a prince who

      was thus exposed, without protection, to those mortal injuries.

     

      These sentiments of the public made the cardinal of Winchester and his

      party sensible that it was necessary to destroy a man whose popularity

      might become dangerous, and whose resentment they had so much cause to

      apprehend. In order to effect their purpose, a parliament was summoned to

      meet, not at London, which was supposed to be too well affected to the

      duke, but at St. Edmondsbury, where they expected that he would lie

      entirely at their mercy. As soon as he appeared, he was accused of

      treason, and thrown into prison. He was soon after found dead in his

      bed;[**] and though it was pretended that his death was natural, and

      though his body, which was exposed to public view, bore no marks of

      outward violence, no one doubted but he had fallen a victim to the

      vengeance of his enemies.

     

      An artifice, formerly practised in the case of Edward II., Richard II.,

      and Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Glocester, could deceive nobody. The

      reason of this assassination of the duke seems, not that the ruling party

      apprehended his acquittal in parliament on account of his innocence,

      which, in such times, was seldom much regarded, but that they imagined his

      public trial and execution would have been more invidious than his private

      murder which they pretended to deny. Some gentlemen of his retinue were

      afterwards tried as accomplices in his treasons, and were condemned to be

      hanged, drawn, and quartered, They were hanged and cut down; but just as

      the executioner was proceeding to quarter them, their pardon was produced,

      and they were recovered to life;[*] the most barbarous kind of mercy that

      can possibly be imagined!

     

      This prince is said to have received a better education than was usual in

      his age, to have founded one of the first public libraries in England, and

      to have been a great patron of learned men. Among other advantages which

      he reaped from this turn of mind, it tended much to cure him of credulity

      of which the following instance is given by Sir Thomas More. There was a

      man who pretended that, though he was born blind, he had recovered his

      sight by touching the shrine of St. Albans. The duke, happening soon after

      to pass that way, questioned the man, and seeming to doubt of his sight,

      asked him the colors of several cloaks, worn by persons of his retinue.

      The man told them very readily. “You are a knave,” cried the prince; “had

      you been born blind, you could not so soon have learned to distinguish

      colors;” and immediately ordered him to be set in the stocks as an

      impostor.[**]

     

      The cardinal of Winchester died six weeks after his nephew whose murder

      was universally ascribed to him as well as to the duke of Suffolk, and

      which, it is said, gave him more remorse in his last moments than could

      naturally be expected from a man hardened, during the course of a long

      life, in falsehood and in politics. What share the queen had in this guilt

      is uncertain; her usual activity and spirit made the public conclude, with

      some reason, that the duke’s enemies durst not have ventured on such a

      deed without her privity. But there happened, soon after, an event of

      which she and her favorite, the duke of Suffolk, bore incontestably the

      whole odium.

     

      That article of the marriage treaty by which the province of Maine was to

      be ceded to Charles of Anjou, the queen’s unele, had probably been

      hitherto kept secret; and during the lifetime of the duke of Glocester, it

      might have been dangerous to venture on the execution of it. But as the

      court of France strenuously insisted on performance, orders were now

      despatched, under Henry’s hand, to Sir Francis Surienne, governor of Mans,

      commanding him to surrender that place to Charles of Anjou. Surienne,

      either questioning the authenticity of the order, or regarding his

      government as his sole fortune, refused compliance; and it became

      necessary for a French army, under the count of Dunois, to lay siege to

      the city. The governor made as good a defence as his situation could

      permit; but receiving no relief from Edmund, duke of Somerset, who was at

      that time governor of Normandy, he was at last obliged to capitulate, and

      to surrender not only Mans, but all the other fortresses of that province,

      which was thus entirely alienated from the crown of England.

     

      1448.

     

      The bad effects of this measure stopped not here. Surienne, at the head of

      all his garrisons, amounting to two thousand five hundred men, retired

      into Normandy, in expectation of being taken into pay, and of being

      quartered in some towns of that province. But Somerset, who had no means

      of subsisting such a multitude, and who was probably incensed at

      Surienne’s disobedience, refused to admit him; and this adventurer, not

      daring to commit depredations on the territories either of the king of

      France or of England, marched into Brittany, seized the town of Fougeres,

      repaired the fortifications of Pontorson and St. James de Beuvron, and

      subsisted his troops by the ravages which he exercised on that whole

      province.[*] The duke of Brittany complained of this violence to the king

      of France, his liege lord: Charles remonstrated with the duke of Somerset:

      that nobleman replied, that the injury was done without his privity, and

      that he had no authority over Surienne and his companions.[**] Though this

      answer ought to have appeared satisfactory to Charles, who had often felt

      severely the licentious independent spirit of such mercenary soldiers, he

      never would admit of the apology. He still insisted that these plunderers

      should be recalled, and that reparation should be made to the duke of

      Brittany for all the damages which he had sustained: and in order to

      render an accommodation absolutely impracticable, he made the estimation

      of damages amount to no less a sum than one million six hundred thousand

      crowns. He was sensible of the superiority which the present state of his

      affairs gave him over England; and he determined to take advantage of it.

     

      No sooner was the truce concluded between the two kingdoms, than Charles

      employed himself, with great industry and judgment, in repairing those

      numberless ills to which France, from the continuance of wars both foreign

      and domestic, had so long been exposed. He restored the course of public

      justice; he introduced order into the finances; he established discipline

      in his troops; he repressed faction in his court; he revived the languid

      state of agriculture and the arts; and, in the course of a few years, he

      rendered his kingdom flourishing within itself, and formidable to its

      neighbors. Meanwhile, affairs in England had taken a very different turn.

      The court was divided into parties, which were enraged against each other:

      the people were discontented with the government: conquests in France,

      which were an object more of glory than of interest, were overlooked

      amidst domestic incidents, which engrossed the attention of all men: the

      governor of Normandy, ill supplied with money, was obliged to dismiss the

      greater part of his troops, and to allow the fortifications of the towns

      and castles to become ruinous; and the nobility and people of that

      province had, during the late open communication with France, enjoyed

      frequent opportunities of renewing connections with their ancient master,

      and of concerting the means for expelling the English. The occasion,

      therefore, seemed favorable to Charles for breaking the truce.

     

      1449.

     

      Normandy was at once invaded by four powerful armies: one commanded by the

      king himself; a second by the duke of Brittany; a third by the duke of

      AlenÃ§on; and a fourth by the count of Dunois. The places opened their

      gates almost as soon as the French appeared before them; Verneuil, Nogent,

      Chateau Gaillard, Ponteau de Mer, Gisors, Mante, Vernon, Argentan Lisieux,

      Fecamp, Coutances, Belesme, Pont de l’Arche, fell in an instant into the

      hands of the enemy. The duke of Somerset, so far from having an army which

      could take the field and relieve these places, was not able to supply them

      with the necessary garrisons and provisions. He retired, with the few

      troops of which he was master, into Rouen; and thought it sufficient, if,

      till the arrival of succors from England, he could save that capital from

      the general fate of the province. The king of France, at the head of a

      formidable army, fifty thousand strong, presented himself before the

      gates: the dangerous example of revolt had infected the inhabitants; and

      they called aloud for a capitulation. Somerset, unable to resist at once

      both the enemies within one from without, retired with his garrison into

      the palace and castle; which, being places not tenable he was obliged to

      surrender: he purchased a retreat to Harfleur by the payment of fifty-six

      thousand crowns, by engaging to surrender Arques, Tancarville, Caudebec,

      Honfleur, and other places in the higher Normandy, and by delivering.

      hostages for the performance of articles.[*]

     

      1450.

     

      The governor of Honfleur refused to obey his orders; upon which the earl

      of Shrewsbury, who was one of the hostages, was detained prisoner; and the

      English were thus deprived of the only general capable of recovering them

      from their present distressed; situation. Harfleur made a better defence

      under Sir Thomas Curson, the governor; but was finally obliged to open its

      gates to Dunois. Succors at last appeared from England, under Sir Thomas

      Kyriel, and landed at Cherbourg: but these came very late, amounted only

      to four thousand men, and were soon after put to rout at Fourmigni by the

      count of Clermont.[**] This battle, or rather skirmish, was the only

      action fought by the English for the defence of their dominions in France,

      which they had purchased at such an expense of blood and treasure.

      Somerset, shut up in Caen, without any prospect of relief, found it

      necessary to capitulate: Falaise opened its gates, on condition that the

      earl of Shrewsbury should be restored to liberty: and Cherbourg, the last

      place of Normandy which remained in the hands of the English, being

      delivered up, the conquest of that important province was finished in a

      twelvemonth by Charles, to the great joy of the inhabitants, and of his

      whole kingdom.[***]

     

      A like rapid success attended the French arms in Guienne; though the

      inhabitants of that province were, from long custom, better inclined to

      the English government. Dunois was despatched thither, and met with no

      resistance in the field, and very little from the towns. Great

      improvements had been made during this age in the structure and management

      of artillery, and none in fortification; and the art of defence was by

      that means more unequal, than either before or since, to the art of

      attack. After all the small places about Bordeaux were reduced, that city

      agreed to submit, if not relieved by a certain time; and as no one in

      England thought Seriously of these distant concerns, no relief appeared;

      the place surrendered; and Bayonne being taken soon after, this whole

      province, which had remained united to England since the accession of

      Henry II., was, after a period of three centuries, finally swallowed up in

      the French monarchy.

     

      Though no peace or truce was concluded between France and England, the war

      was in a manner at an end. The English, torn in pieces by the civil

      dissensions which ensued, made but one feeble effort more for the recovery

      of Guienne, and Charles, occupied at home in regulating the government,

      and fencing against the intrigues of his factious son, Lewis the dauphin,

      scarcely ever attempted to invade them in their island, or to retaliate

      upon them, by availing himself of their intestine confusions
