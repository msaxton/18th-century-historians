After the commencement of the religious wars in France, which rendered

that flourishing kingdom, during the course of near forty years, a scene

of horror and devastation, the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and

England; and it was not long before an animosity, first political, then

personal, broke out between the sovereigns of these countries.

 

Philip II. of Spain, though he reached not any enlarged views of policy,

was endowed with great industry and sagacity, a remarkable caution in his

enterprises, an unusual foresight in all his measures; and as he was ever

cool, and seemingly unmoved by passion, and possessed neither talents nor

inclination for war, both his subjects and his neighbors had reason to

expect justice, happiness, and tranquillity from his administration. But

prejudices had on him as pernicious effects as ever passion had on any

other monarch; and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny by which he was

actuated, with the fraudulent maxims which governed his counsels, excited

the most violent agitation among his own people, engaged him in acts of

the most enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe into combustion.

 

After Philip had concluded peace at Chateau-Cambresis and had remained

some time in the Netherlands, in order to settle the affairs of that

country, he embarked for Spain; and as the gravity of that nation, with

their respectful obedience to their prince, had appeared more agreeable to

his humor than the homely, familiar manners and the pertinacious liberty

of the Flemings, it was expected that he would for the future reside

altogether at Madrid, and would govern all his extensive dominions by

Spanish ministers and Spanish counsels. Having met with a violent tempest

on his voyage, he no sooner arrived in harbor than he fell on his knees;

and after giving thanks for his deliverance, he vowed that his life, which

was thus providentially saved, should thenceforth be entirely devoted to

the extirpation of heresy.[*] His subsequent conduct corresponded to these

professions. Finding that the new doctrines had penetrated into Spain, he

let loose the rage of persecution against all who professed them, or were

suspected of adhering to them; and by his violence he gave new edge even

to the usual cruelty of priests and inquisitors. He threw into prison

Constantine Ponce, who had been confessor to his father, the emperor

Charles; who had attended him during his retreat; and in whose arms that

great monarch had terminated his life: and after this ecclesiastic died in

confinement, he still ordered him to be tried and condemned for heresy,

and his statue to be committed to the flames. He even deliberated whether

he should not exercise like severity against the memory of his father, who

was suspected, during his later years, to have indulged a propensity

towards the Lutheran principles: in his unrelenting zeal for orthodoxy, he

spared neither age, sex, nor condition: he was present, with an inflexible

countenance, at the most barbarous executions: he issued rigorous orders

for the prosecution of heretics in Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low

Countries: and having founded his determined tyranny on maxims of civil

policy, as well as on principles of religion, he made it apparent to all

his subjects, that there was no method, except the most entire compliance

or most obstinate resistance, to escape or elude the severity of his

vengeance.

 

During that extreme animosity which prevailed between the adherents of the

opposite religions, the civil magistrate, who found it difficult, if not

impossible, for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries, was

naturally led, by specious rules of prudence, in embracing one party, to

declare war against the other, and to exterminate by fire and sword those

bigots who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to an

opposition of his power and to a hatred of his person. If any prince

possessed such enlarged views as to foresee, that a mutual toleration

would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met with

difficulties in reducing this principle to practice; and might deem the

malady too violent to await a remedy, which, though certain, must

necessarily be slow in its operation. But Philip, though a profound

hypocrite, and extremely governed by self-interest seems also to have been

himself actuated by an imperious bigotry; and as he employed great

reflection in all his conduct, he could easily palliate the gratification

of his natural temper under the color of wisdom, and find in this system

no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic politics. By placing

himself at the head of the Catholic party, he converted the zealots of the

ancient faith into partisans of Spanish greatness; and by employing the

powerful allurement of religion, he seduced every where the subjects from

that allegiance which they owed to their native sovereign.

 

The course of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had placed

Elizabeth in a situation diametrically opposite; and had raised her to be

the glory, the bulwark, and the support of the numerous, though still

persecuted Protestants, throughout Europe. More moderate in her temper

than Philip, she found, with pleasure, that the principles of her sect

required not such extreme severity in her domestic government as was

exercised by that monarch; and having no object but self-preservation, she

united her interests in all foreign negotiations with those who were every

where struggling under oppression, and guarding themselves against ruin

and extermination. The more virtuous sovereign was thus happily thrown

into the more favorable cause; and fortune, in this instance, concurred

with policy and nature.

 

During the lifetime of Henry II. of France, and of his successor, the

force of these principles was somewhat restrained, though not altogether

overcome, by motives of a superior interest; and the dread of uniting

England with the French monarchy engaged Philip to maintain a good

correspondence with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he rejected the

garter which she sent him; he refused to ratify the ancient league between

the house of Burgundy and England;[*] he furnished ships to transport

French forces into Scotland; he endeavored to intercept the earl of Arran,

who was hastening to join the malecontents in that country; and the

queen’s wisest ministers still regarded his friendship as hollow and

precarious.[**]

 

But no sooner did the death of Francis II. put an end to Philip’s

apprehensions with regard to Mary’s succession, than his animosity against

Elizabeth began more openly to appear; and the interests of Spain and

those of England were found opposite in every negotiation and transaction.

 

The two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain, being

possessed of nearly equal force, were naturally antagonists; and England,

from its power and situation, was entitled to support its own dignity, as

well as tranquillity, by holding the balance between them. Whatever

incident, therefore, tended too much to depress one of these rival powers,

as it left the other without control, might be deemed contrary to the

interests of England; yet so much were these great maxims of policy

overruled, during that age, by the disputes of theology, that Philip found

an advantage in supporting the established government and religion of

France, and Elizabeth in protecting faction and innovation.

 

The queen regent of France, when reinstated in authority by the death of

her son Francis, had formed a plan of administration more subtle than

judicious; and balancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke of

Guise with the prince of CondÃ©, she endeavored to render herself necessary

to both, and to establish her own dominion on their constrained

obedience.[*] But the equal counterpoise of power, which, among foreign

nations, is the source of tranquillity, proves always the ground of

quarrel between domestic factions; and if the animosity of religion concur

with the frequent occasions which present themselves of mutual injury, it

is impossible during any time, to preserve a firm concord in so delicate a

situation. The constable Montmorency, moved by zeal for the ancient faith,

joined himself to the duke of Guise: the king of Navarre, from his

inconstant temper, and his jealousy of the superior genius of his brother,

embraced the same party: and Catharine, finding herself depressed by this

combination, had recourse to CondÃ© and the Hugonots, who gladly embraced

the opportunity of fortifying themselves by her countenance and

protection.[**]

 

An edict had been published, granting a toleration to the Protestants; but

the interested violence of the duke of Guise, covered with the pretence of

religious zeal, broke through this agreement; and the two parties, after

the fallacious tranquillity of a moment, renewed their mutual insults and

injuries. CondÃ©, Coligny, Andelot assembled their friends and flew to

arms: Guise and Montmorency got possession of the king’s person, and

constrained the queen regent to embrace their party: fourteen armies were

levied and put in motion in different parts of France;[*] each province,

each city, each family, was agitated with intestine rage and animosity.

The father was divided against the son; brother against brother; and women

themselves, sacrificing their humanity as well as their timidity to the

religious fury, distinguished themselves by acts of ferocity and

valor.[**] Wherever the Hugonots prevailed, the images were broken, the

altars pillaged, the churches demolished, the monasteries consumed with

fire: where success attended the Catholics, they burned the Bibles,

rebaptized the infants, constrained married persons to pass anew through

the nuptial ceremony: and plunder, desolation, and bloodshed attended

equally the triumph of both parties. The parliament of Paris itself, the

seat of law and justice, instead of employing its authority to compose

these fatal quarrels, published an edict by which it put the sword into

the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered the Catholics every

where to massacre the Hugonots:[***] and it was during this period, when

men began to be somewhat enlightened, and in this nation, renowned for

polished manners, that the theological rage, which had long been boiling

in men’s veins, seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and

ferocity.

 

Philip, jealous of the progress which the Hugonots made in France, and

dreading that the contagion would spread into the Low Country provinces,

had formed a secret alliance with the princes of Guise, and had entered

into a mutual concert for the protection of the ancient faith and the

suppression of heresy. He now sent six thousand men, with some supply of

money, to reÃ«nforce the Catholic party; and the prince of CondÃ©, finding

himself unequal to so great a combination, countenanced by the royal

authority, was obliged to despatch the Vidame of Chartres and Briguemaut

to London, in order to crave the assistance and protection of Elizabeth.

Most of the province of Normandy was possessed by the Hugonots: and CondÃ©

offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the English; on condition

that, together with three thousand man for the garrison of that place, the

queen should likewise send over three thousand to defend Dieppe and Rouen,

and should furnish the prince with a supply of a hundred thousand

crowns.[*]

 

Elizabeth, besides the general and essential interest of supporting the

Protestants, and opposing the rapid progress of her enemy the duke of

Guise, had other motives which engaged her to accept of this proposal.

When she concluded the peace at Chateau-Cambresis, she had good reason to

foresee that France never would voluntarily fulfil the article which

regarded the restitution of Calais; and many subsequent incidents had

tended to confirm this suspicion. Considerable sums of money had been

expended on the fortifications; long leases had been granted of the lands;

and many inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle there, by

assurances that Calais should never be restored to the English.[**] The

queen therefore wisely concluded, that, could she get possession of Havre,

a place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and was of greater

importance than Calais, she should easily constrain the French to execute

the treaty, and should have the glory of restoring to the crown that

ancient possession, so much the favorite of the nation.

 

No measure could be more generally odious in France than the conclusion of

this treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare the conduct

of Guise, who had finally expelled the English, and had debarred these

dangerous and destructive enemies from all access into France, with the

treasonable politics of CondÃ©, who had again granted them an entrance into

the heart of the kingdom. The prince had the more reason to repent of this

measure, as he reaped not from it all the advantage which he expected.

Three thousand English immediately took possession of Havre and Dieppe,

under the command of Sir Edward Poinings; but the latter place was found

so little capable of defence, that it was immediately abandoned.[***] The

siege of Rouen was already formed by the Catholics, under the command of

the king of Navarre and Montmorency; and it was with difficulty that

Poinings could throw a small reÃ«nforcement into the place. Though these

English troops behaved with gallantry,[****] and though the king of

Navarre was mortally wounded during the siege, the Catholics still

continued the attack of the place, and carrying it at last by assault, put

the whole garrison to the sword.

 

The earl of Warwick, eldest son of the late duke of Northumberland,

arrived soon after at Havre with another body of three thousand English,

and took on him the command of the place.

 

It was expected that the French Catholics, flushed with their success at

Rouen, would immediately have formed the siege of Havre, which was not as

yet in any condition of defence; but the intestine disorders of the

kingdom soon diverted their attention to another enterprise. Andelot,

seconded by the negotiations of Elizabeth, had levied a considerable body

of Protestants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the seat of the

Hugonots’ power, he enabled the prince of CondÃ© and the admiral to take

the field, and oppose the progress of their enemies. After threatening

Paris during some time, they took their march towards Normandy, with a

view of engaging the English to act in conjunction with them, and of

fortifying themselves by the further assistance which they expected from

the zeal and vigor of Elizabeth.[*] The Catholics, commanded by the

constable, and under him by the duke of Guise, followed on their rear; and

overtaking them at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. The field was

fought with great obstinacy on both sides; and the action was

distinguished by this singular event, that CondÃ© and Montmorency, the

commanders of the opposite armies, fell both of them prisoners into the

hands of their enemies. The appearances of victory remained with Guise,

but the admiral, whose fate it ever was to be defeated, and still to rise

more terrible after his misfortunes, collected the remains of the army;

and inspiring his own unconquerable courage and constancy into every

breast, kept them in a body, and subdued some considerable places in

Normandy. Elizabeth, the better to support his cause, sent him a new

supply of a hundred thousand crowns; and offered, if he could find

merchants to lend him the money, to give her bond for another sum of equal

amount.[**]

 

1563.

 

The expenses incurred by assisting the French Hugonots had emptied the

queen’s exchequer; and in order to obtain supply, she found herself under

a necessity of summoning a parliament: an expedient to which she never

willingly had recourse. A little before the meeting of this assembly, she

had fallen into a dangerous illness, the small-pox; and as her life,

during some time, was despaired of, the people became the more sensible of

their perilous situation, derived from the uncertainty, which, in case of

her demise, attended the succession of the crown. The partisans of the

queen of Scots, and those of the house of Suffolk, already divided the

nation into factions; and every one foresaw, that, though it might be

possible at present to determine the controversy by law, yet, if the

throne were vacant, nothing but the sword would be able to fix a

successor. The commons, therefore, on the opening of the session, voted an

address to the queen; in which, after enumerating the dangers attending a

broken and doubtful succession, and mentioning the evils which their

fathers had experienced from the contending titles of York and Lancaster,

they entreated the queen to put an end to their apprehensions, by choosing

some husband, whom they promised, whoever he were, gratefully to receive,

and faithfully to serve, honor, and obey: or if she had entertained any

reluctance to the married state, they desired that the lawful successor

might be named, at least appointed by act of parliament. They remarked,

that, during all the reigns which had passed since the conquest, the

nation had never before been so unhappy as not to know the person who, in

case of the sovereign’s death, was legally entitled to fill the vacant

throne. And they observed, that the fixed order which took place in

inheriting the French monarchy, was one chief source of the usual

tranquillity, as well as of the happiness, of that kingdom.[*]

 

This subject, though extremely interesting to the nation, was very little

agreeable to the queen; and she was sensible that great difficulties would

attend every decision. A declaration in favor of the queen of Scots would

form a settlement perfectly legal; because that princess was commonly

allowed to possess the right of blood; and the exclusion given by Henry’s

will, deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parliament, would lose

all authority whenever the queen and parliament had made a new settlement,

and restored the Scottish line to its place in the succession. But she

dreaded giving encouragement to the Catholics, her secret enemies, by this

declaration. She was sensible that every heir was, in some degree, a

rival; much more one who enjoyed a claim for the present possession of the

crown, and who had already advanced, in a very open manner, these

dangerous pretensions. The great power of Mary, both from the favor of the

Catholic princes, and her connections with the house of Guise, not to

mention the force and situation of Scotland, was well known to her; and

she saw no security, that this princess, if fortified by a sure prospect

of succession, would not revive claims which she could never yet be

prevailed on formally to relinquish. On the other hand, the title of the

house of Suffolk was supported by the more zealous Protestants only; and

it was very doubtful whether even a parliamentary declaration in its favor

would bestow on it such validity as to give satisfaction to the people.

The republican part of the constitution had not yet acquired such an

ascendant as to control, in any degree, the ideas of hereditary right, and

as the legality of Henry’s will was still disputed, though founded on the

utmost authority which a parliament could confer, who could be assured

that a more recent act would be acknowledged to have greater validity? In

the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place, the right of blood

had still prevailed over religious prejudices; and the nation had ever

shown itself disposed rather to change its faith than the order of

succession. Even many Protestants declared themselves in favor of Mary’s

claim of inheritance;[*] and nothing would occasion more general disgust,

than to see the queen, openly and without reserve, take part against it.

 

The Scottish princess also, finding herself injured in so sensible a

point, would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together her

foreign and domestic friends, the partisans of her present title and of

her eventual succession, would soon bring matters to extremities against

the present establishment. The queen, weighing all these inconveniences,

which were great and urgent, was determined to keep both parties in awe,

by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct; and she rather chose that the

people should run the hazard of contingent events, than that she herself

should visibly endanger her throne, by employing expedients, which, at

best, would not bestow entire security on the nation. She gave, therefore,

an evasive answer to the applications of the commons; and when the house,

at the end of the session, desired, by the mouth of their speaker, further

satisfaction on that head, she could not be prevailed on to make her reply

more explicit. She only told them, contrary to her declarations in the

beginning of her reign, that she had fixed no absolute resolution against

marriage; and she added, that the difficulties attending the question of

the succession were so great that she would be contented, for the sake of

her people, to remain some time longer in this vale of misery; and never

should depart life with satisfaction, till she had laid some solid

foundation for their future security.[*]

 

The most remarkable law passed this session, was that which bore the title

of “Assurance of the queen’s royal power over all states and subjects

within her dominions.”[**] By this act, the asserting twice, by writing,

word, or deed, the pope’s authority, was subjected to the penalties of

treason. All persons in holy orders were bound to take the oath of

supremacy; as also all who were advanced to any degree, either in the

universities or in common law; all schoolmasters, officers in court, or

members of parliament: and the penalty of their second refusal was

treason. The first offence, in both cases, was punished by banishment and

forfeiture. This rigorous statute was not extended to any of the degree of

a baron; because it was not supposed that the queen could entertain any

doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons possessed of such high

dignity. Lord Montacute made opposition to the bill; and asserted, in

favor of the Catholics, that they disputed not, they preached not, they

disobeyed not the queen, they caused no trouble, no tumults among the

people.[***] It is, however, probable, that some suspicions of their

secret conspiracies had made the queen and parliament increase their rigor

against them; though it is also more than probable, that they were

mistaken in the remedy.

 

There was likewise another point, in which the parliament, this session,

showed more the goodness of their intention than the soundness of their

judgment. They passed a law against fond and fantastical prophecies, which

had been observed to seduce the people into rebellion and disorder:[****]

but at the same time they enacted a statute, which was most likely to

increase these and such like superstitions: it was levelled against

conjurations, enchantments, and witchcraft.[v]

 

Witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which commonly increase by

punishment, and never are so effectually suppressed as by being totally

neglected. After the parliament had granted the queen a supply of one

subsidy and two fifteenths, the session was finished by a prorogation. The

convocation likewise voted the queen a subsidy of six shillings in the

pound, payable in three years.

 

While the English parties exerted these calm efforts against each other in

parliamentary votes and debates, the French factions, inflamed to the

highest degree of animosity, continued that cruel war which their

intemperate zeal, actuated by the ambition of their leaders, had kindled

in the kingdom. The admiral was successful in reducing the towns of

Normandy which held for the king; but he frequently complained that the

numerous garrison of Havre remained totally inactive, and was not employed

in any military operation against the common enemy. The queen, in taking

possession of that place, had published a manifesto,[*] in which she

pretended that her concern for the interests of the French king had

engaged her in that measure, and that her sole intention was to oppose her

enemies of the house of Guise, who held their prince in captivity, and

employed his power to the destruction of his best and most faithful

subjects. It was chiefly her desire to preserve appearances, joined to the

great frugality of her temper, which made her at this critical juncture

keep her soldiers in garrison, and restrain them from committing further

hostilities upon the enemy.[**]

 

The duke of Guise, meanwhile, was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the

Hugonots; and had commenced the siege of Orleans, of which Andelot was

governor, and where the constable was detained prisoner. He had the

prospect of speedy success in this undertaking; when he was assassinated

by Poltrot, a young gentleman whose zeal, instigated (as is pretended,

though without any certain foundation) by the admiral, and Beza, a famous

preacher, led him to attempt that criminal enterprise. The death of this

gallant prince was a sensible loss to the Catholic party; and though the

cardinal of Lorraine, his brother, still supported the interests of the

family, the danger of their progress appeared not so imminent either to

Elizabeth or to the French Protestants. The union, therefore, between

these allies, which had been cemented by their common fears, began

thenceforth to be less intimate; and the leaders of the Hugonots were

persuaded to hearken to terms of a separate accommodation. CondÃ© and

Montmorency held conferences for settling the peace; and as they were both

of them impatient to relieve themselves from captivity, they soon came to

an agreement with regard to the conditions. The character of the queen

regent, whose ends were always violent, but who endeavored by subtlety and

policy, rather than force, to attain them, led her to embrace any

plausible terms; and in spite of the protestations of the admiral, whose

sagacity could easily discover the treachery of the court, the articles of

agreement were finally settled between the parties. A toleration under

some restrictions was anew granted to the Protestants; a general amnesty

was published; CondÃ© was reinstated in his offices and governments; and

after money was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German

troops, they were dismissed the kingdom.

 

By the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of CondÃ©, it had been

stipulated,[*] that neither party should conclude peace without the

consent of the other; but this article was at present but little regarded

by the leaders of the French Protestants. They only comprehended her so

far in the treaty, as to obtain a promise that, on her relinquishing

Havre, her charges, and the money which she had advanced them, should be

repaid her by the king of France, and that Calais, on the expiration of

the term, should be restored to her. But she disdained to accept of these

conditions; and thinking the possession of Havre a much better pledge for

effecting her purpose, she sent Warwick orders to prepare himself against

an attack from the now united power of the French monarchy.

 

The earl of Warwick, who commanded a garrison of six thousand men, besides

seven hundred pioneers, had no sooner got possession of Havre, than he

employed every means for putting it in a posture of defence;[**] and after

expelling the French from the town, he encouraged his soldiers to make the

most desperate defence against the enemy. The constable commanded the

French army; the queen regent herself and the king were present in the

camp; even the prince of CondÃ© joined the king’s forces, and gave

countenance to this enterprise; the admiral and Andelot alone, anxious

still to preserve the friendship of Elizabeth, kept at a distance, and

prudently refused to join their ancient enemies in an attack upon their

allies.

 

From the force, and dispositions, and situation of both sides it was

expected that the siege would be attended with some memorable event; yet

did France make a much easier acquisition of this important place than was

at first apprehended. The plague crept in among the English soldiers; and

being increased by their fatigue and bad diet, (for they were but ill

supplied with provisions,[*]) it made such ravages, that sometimes a

hundred men a day died of it; and there remained not, at last, fifteen

hundred in a condition to do duty.[**] The French, meeting with such

feeble resistance, carried on their attacks successfully; and having made

two breaches, each of them sixty feet wide, they prepared for a general

assault, which must have terminated in the slaughter of the whole

garrison.[***] Warwick, who had frequently warned the English council of

the danger, and who had loudly demanded a supply of men and provisions,

found himself obliged to capitulate, and to content himself with the

liberty of withdrawing his garrison. The articles were no sooner signed,

than Lord Clinton, the admiral, who had been detained by contrary winds,

appeared off the harbor with a reÃ«nforcement of three thousand men; and

found the place surrendered to the enemy. To increase the misfortune, the

infected army brought the plague with them into England, where it swept

off great multitudes, particularly in the city of London. Above twenty

thousand persons there died of it in one year.[****] 6
 

Elizabeth, whose usual vigor and foresight had not appeared in this

transaction, was now glad to compound matters; and as the queen regent

desired to obtain leisure, in order to prepare measures for the

extermination of the Hugonots, she readily hearkened to any reasonable

terms of accommodation with England.[*]

 

1564.

 

It was agreed, that the hostages which the French had given for the

restitution of Calais, should be restored for two hundred and twenty

thousand crowns; and that both sides should retain all their claims and

pretensions.

 

The peace still continued with Scotland and even a cordial friendship

seemed to have been cemented between Elizabeth and Mary. These princesses

made profession of the most entire affection; wrote amicable letters every

week to each other; and had adopted, in all appearance, the sentiments as

well as style of sisters. Elizabeth punished one Hales, who had published

a book against Mary’s title;[*] and as the lord keeper Bacon was thought

to have encouraged Hales in this undertaking, he fell under her

displeasure, and it was with some difficulty he was able to give her

satisfaction, and recover her favor.[**] The two queens had agreed in the

foregoing summer to an interview at York,[***] in order to remove all

difficulties with regard to Mary’s ratification of the treaty of

Edinburgh, and to consider of the proper method for settling the

succession of England; but as Elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this

delicate subject, she employed a pretence of the wars in France, which,

she said, would detain her in London; and she delayed till next year the

intended interview. It is also probable, that being well acquainted with

the beauty, and address, and accomplishments of Mary, she did not choose

to stand the comparison with regard to those exterior qualities, in which

she was eclipsed by her rival; and was unwilling that a princess, who had

already made great progress in the esteem and affections of the English,

should have a further opportunity of increasing the number of her

partisans.

 

Mary’s close connections with the house of Guise, and her devoted

attachment to her uncles, by whom she had been early educated and

constantly protected, was the ground of just and insurmountable jealousy

to Elizabeth, who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies, and

was well acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects.

They had made offer of their niece to Don Carlos, Philip’s son; to the

king of Sweden, the king of Navarre, the archduke Charles, the duke of

Ferrara, the cardinal of Bourbon, who had only taken deacon’s orders, from

which he might easily be freed by a dispensation; and they were ready to

marry her to any one who could strengthen their interests, or give

inquietude and disturbance to Elizabeth.[*]

 

Elizabeth, on her part, was equally vigilant to prevent the execution of

their schemes, and was particularly anxious lest Mary should form any

powerful foreign alliance, which might tempt her to revive her pretensions

to the crown, and to invade the kingdom on the side where it was weakest

and lay most exposed.[*] As she believed that the marriage with the

archduke Charles was the one most likely to have place, she used every

expedient to prevent it; and besides remonstrating against it to Mary

herself, she endeavored to draw off the archduke from that pursuit, by

giving him some hopes of success in his pretensions to herself, and by

inviting him to a renewal of the former treaty of marriage.[**] She always

told the queen of Scots, that nothing would satisfy her but her espousing

some English nobleman, who would remove all grounds of jealousy, and

cement the union between the kingdoms; and she offered on this condition

to have her title examined, and to declare her successor to the

crown.[***] After keeping the matter in these general terms during a

twelvemonth, she at last named Lord Robert Dudley, now created earl of

Leicester, as the person on whom she desired that Mary’s choice should

fall.

 

 ENLARGE
 

The earl of Leicester, the great and powerful favorite of Elizabeth,

possessed all those exterior qualities which are naturally alluring to the

fair sex; a handsome person, a polite address, an insinuating behavior;

and by means of these accomplishments he had been able to blind even the

penetration of Elizabeth, and conceal from her the great defects, or

rather odious vices, which attended his character. He was proud, insolent,

interested, ambitious; without honor, without generosity, without

humanity; and atoned not for these bad qualities by such abilities or

courage as could fit him for that high trust and confidence with which she

always honored him. Her constant and declared attachment to him had

naturally emboldened him to aspire to her bed; and in order to make way

for these nuptials, he was universally believed to have murdered, in a

barbarous manner, his wife, the heiress of one Robesart. The proposal of

espousing Mary was by no means agreeable to him; and he always ascribed it

to the contrivance of Cecil, his enemy; who, he thought, intended by that

artifice to make him lose the friendship of Mary from the temerity of his

pretensions, and that of Elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to

another woman.[****]

 

The queen herself had not any serious intention of effecting this

marriage, but as she was desirous that the queen of Scots should never

have any husband, she named a man who, she believed, was not likely to be

accepted of; and she hoped by that means to gain time, and elude the

project of any other alliance. The earl of Leicester was too great a

favorite to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the prospect of

being declared successor to the crown, seemed at last to hearken to

Elizabeth’s proposal, this princess receded from her offers, and withdrew

the bait which she had thrown out to her rival.[*] This duplicity of

conduct, joined to some appearance of an imperious superiority assumed by

her, had drawn a peevish letter from Mary; and the seemingly amicable

correspondence between the two queens was, during some time, interrupted.

In order to make up the breach, the queen of Scots despatched Sir James

Melvil to London; who has given us in his memoirs a particular account of

his negotiation.

 

Melvil was an agreeable courtier, a man of address and conversation; and

it was recommended to him by his mistress, that, besides grave reasonings

concerning politics and state affairs, he should introduce more

entertaining topics of conversation, suitable to the sprightly character

of Elizabeth, and should endeavor by that means to insinuate himself into

her confidence. He succeeded so well, that he threw that artful princess

entirely off her guard,[**] and made her discover the bottom of her heart,

full of all those levities, and follies, and ideas of rivalship which

possess the youngest and most frivolous of her sex.

 

He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to mention the different

dresses of the ladies in different countries, and the particular

advantages of each in setting off the beauties of the shape and person.

The queen said, that she had dresses of all countries; and she took care

thenceforth to meet the ambassador every day apparelled in a different

habit: sometimes she was dressed in the English garb, sometimes in the

French, sometimes in the Italian; and she asked him which of them became

her most. He answered, the Italian; a reply that he knew would be

agreeable to her, because that mode showed to advantage her flowing locks,

which, he remarked, though they were more red than yellow, she fancied to

be the finest in the world. She desired to know of him what was reputed

the best color of hair: she asked whether his queen or she had the finest

hair: she even inquired which of them he esteemed the fairest person; a

very delicate question, and which he prudently eluded, by saying that her

majesty was the fairest person in England and his mistress in Scotland.

She next demanded which of them was tallest: he replied, his queen. “Then

is she too tall,” said Elizabeth; “for I myself am of a just stature.”

Having learned from him that his mistress sometimes recreated herself by

playing on the harpsichord, an instrument on which she herself excelled,

she gave orders to Lord Hunsdon, that he should lead the ambassador, as it

were casually, into an apartment where he might hear her perform; and when

Melvil, as if ravished with the harmony, broke into the queen’s apartment,

she pretended to be displeased with his intrusion; but still took care to

ask him whether he thought Mary or her the best performer on that

instrument.[*] From the whole of her behavior, Melvil thought he might, on

his return, assure his mistress, that she had no reason ever to expect any

cordial friendship from Elizabeth, and that all her professions of amity

were full of falsehood and dissimulation.

 

After two years had been spent in evasions and artifices, Mary’s subjects

and counsellors, and probably herself, began to think it full time that

some marriage were concluded; and Lord Darnley, son of the earl of Lenox,

was the person in whom most men’s opinions and wishes centred. He was

Mary’s cousin-german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to Henry VIII.,

and daughter of the earl of Angus, by Margaret, queen of Scotland. He had

been born and educated in England, where the earl of Lenox had constantly

resided, since he had been banished by the prevailing power of the house

of Hamilton; and as Darnley was now in his twentieth year, and was a very

comely person, tall and delicately shaped, it was hoped that he might soon

render himself agreeable to the queen of Scots. He was also by his father

a branch of the same family with herself; and would, in espousing her,

preserve the royal dignity in the house of Stuart: he was, after her, next

heir to the crown of England; and those who pretended to exclude her on

account of her being a foreigner, had endeavored to recommend his title,

and give it the preference. It seemed no inconsiderable advantage, that

she could, by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as he was by

birth an Englishman, and could not by his power or alliances give any

ground of suspicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the proposal of this

marriage would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess.

 

Elizabeth was well informed of these intentions;[*] and was secretly not

displeased with the projected marriage between Darnley and the queen of

Scots.[**] She would rather have wished that Mary had continued forever in

a single life; but finding little probability of rendering this scheme

effectual, she was satisfied with a choice which freed her at once from

the dread of a foreign alliance, and from the necessity of parting with

Leicester, her favorite. In order to pave the way to Darnley’s marriage,

she secretly desired Mary to invite Lenox into Scotland, to reverse his

attainder, and to restore him to his honors and fortune.[***] And when her

request was complied with, she took care, in order to preserve the

friendship of the Hamiltons and her other partisans in Scotland, to blame

openly this conduct of Mary.[****]

 

1565.

 

Hearing that the negotiation for Darnley’s marriage advanced apace, she

gave that nobleman permission, on his first application, to follow his

father into Scotland: but no sooner did she learn that the queen of Scots

was taken with his figure and person, and that all measures were fixed for

espousing him, than she exclaimed against the marriage; sent Throgmorton

to order Darnley immediately, upon his allegiance, to return to England;

threw the countess of Lenox and her second son into the Tower, where they

suffered a rigorous confinement; seized all Lenox’s English estate; and,

though it was impossible for her to assign one single reason for her

displeasure,[*] she menaced, and, protested, and complained, as if she had

suffered the most grievous injury in the world.

 

The politics of Elizabeth, though judicious, were usually full of

duplicity and artifice; but never more so than in her transactions with

the queen of Scots, where there entered so many little passions and narrow

jealousies, that she durst not avow to the world the reasons of her

conduct, scarcely to her ministers, and scarcely even to herself. But

besides a womanish rivalship and envy against the marriage of this

princess, she had some motives of interest for feigning a displeasure on

the present occasion. It served her as a pretence for refusing to

acknowledge Mary’s title to the succession of England; a point to which,

for good reasons, she was determined never to consent. And it was useful

to her for a purpose still more unfriendly and dangerous, for encouraging

the discontents and rebellion of the Scottish nobility and

ecclesiastics.[*]

 

Nothing can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by a

sovereign attached to a religion different from the established; and it is

scarcely possible that mutual confidence can ever, in such a situation,

have place between the prince and his subjects. Mary’s conduct had been

hitherto in every respect unexceptionable, and even laudable; yet had she

not made such progress in acquiring popularity, as might have been

expected from her gracious deportment and agreeable accomplishments.

Suspicions every moment prevailed on account of her attachment to the

Catholic faith, and especially to her uncles, the open and avowed

promoters of the scheme for exterminating the professors of the reformed

religion throughout all Europe. She still refused to ratify the acts of

parliament which had established the reformation; she made attempts for

restoring to the Catholic bishops some part of their civil

jurisdiction;[**] and she wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in

which, besides professing her attachment to the Catholic faith, she took

notice of her title to succeed to the crown of England, and expressed her

hopes of being able, in some period, to bring back all her dominions to

the bosom of the church.[***] The zealots among the Protestants were not

wanting, in their turn, to exercise their insolence against her, which

tended still more to alienate her from their faith. A law was enacted,

making it capital, on the very first offence, to say mass any where,

except in the queen’s chapel;[****] and it was with difficulty that even

this small indulgence was granted her: the general assembly importuned her

anew to change her religion; to renounce the blasphemous idolatry of the

mass, with the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist; and to embrace the true

religion of Christ Jesus.[v]

 

As she answered in temper, that she was not yet convinced of the falsity

of her religion or the impiety of the mass, and that her apostasy would

lose her the friendship of her allies on the continent, they replied by

assuring her, that their religion was undoubtedly the same which had been

revealed by Jesus Christ, which had been preached by the apostles, and

which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages; that

neither the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papists was built on so solid a

foundation as theirs; that they alone, of all the various species of

religionists spread over the face of the earth, were so happy as to be

possessed of the truth; that those who hear, or rather who gaze on the

mass, allow sacrilege, pronounce blasphemy, and commit most abominable

idolatry; and that the friendship of the King of kings was preferable to

all the alliances in the world.[*]

 

The marriage of the queen of Scots had kindled afresh the zeal of the

reformers, because the family of Lenox was believed to adhere to the

Catholic faith; and though Darnley, who now bore the name of King Henry,

went often to the established church, he could not, by this exterior

compliance, gain the confidence and regard of the ecclesiastics. They

rather laid hold of the opportunity to insult him to his face; and Knox

scrupled not to tell him from the pulpit, that God, for punishment of the

offences and ingratitude of the people, was wont to commit the rule over

them to boys and women.[**] The populace of Edinburgh, instigated by such

doctrines, began to meet and to associate themselves against the

government.[***] But what threatened more immediate danger to Mary’s

authority, were the discontents which prevailed among some of the

principal nobility.

 

The duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the restoration, and still

more with the aggrandizement of the family of Lenox, his hereditary

enemies; and entertained fears lest his own eventual succession to the

crown of Scotland should be excluded by his rival, who had formerly

advanced some pretensions to it. The earl of Murray found his credit at

court much diminished by the interest of Lenox and his son; and began to

apprehend the revocation of some considerable grants which he had obtained

from Mary’s bounty. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and Glencairne, the lords

Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of Grange, Pittarow, were instigated by like

motives; and as these were the persons who had most zealously promoted the

reformation, they were disgusted to find that the queen’s favor was

entirely engrossed by a new cabal, the earls of Bothwell, Athole,

Sutherland, and Huntley; men who were esteemed either lukewarm in

religious controversy, or inclined to the Catholic party. The same ground

of discontent which in other courts is the source of intrigue, faction,

and opposition, commonly produced in Scotland either projects of

assassination or of rebellion; and besides mutual accusations of the

former kind, which it is difficult to clear up,[*] 7 the malecontent lords, as

soon as they saw the queen’s marriage entirely resolved on, entered into a

confederacy for taking arms against their sovereign. They met at Stirling;

pretended an anxious concern for the security of religion; framed

engagements for mutual defence; and made applications to Elizabeth for

assistance and protection.[**] That princess, after publishing the

expressions of her displeasure against the marriage, had secretly ordered

her ambassadors, Randolf and Throgmorton, to give in her name some

promises of support to the malecontents; and had even sent them a supply

of ten thousand pounds, to enable them to begin an insurrection.[***]

 

Mary was no sooner informed of the meeting at Stirling, and the movements

of the lords, than she summoned them to appear at court, in order to

answer for their conduct; and having levied some forces to execute the

laws, she obliged the rebels to leave the low countries, and take shelter

in Argyleshire. That she might more effectually cut off their resources,

she proceeded with the king to Glasgow, and forced them from their

retreat. They appeared at Paisley, in the neighborhood, with about a

thousand horse, and passing the queen’s army, proceeded to Hamilton,

thence to Edinburgh, which they entered without resistance. They expected

great reÃ«nforcements in this place, from the efforts of Knox and the

seditious preachers; and they beat their drums, desiring all men to

enlist, and receive wages for the defence of God’s glory.[****]

 

But the nation was in no disposition for rebellion: Mary was esteemed and

beloved: her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people: and

the interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known, that

their pretence of zeal for religion had little influence even on the

ignorant populace.[*] The king and queen advanced to Edinburgh at the head

of their army: the rebels were obliged to retire into the south; and being

pursued by a force which now amounted to eighteen thousand men,[**] they

found themselves under a necessity of abandoning their country, and of

taking shelter in England.

 

Elizabeth, when she found the event so much to disappoint her

expectations, thought proper to disavow all connections with the Scottish

malecontents, and to declare every where, that she had never given them

any encouragement, nor any promise of countenance or assistance. She even

carried further her dissimulation and hypocrisy. Murray had come to

London, with the abbot of Kilwinning, agent for Chatelrault; and she

seduced them, by secret assurances of protection, to declare before the

ambassadors of France and Spain that she had nowise contributed to their

insurrection. No sooner had she extorted this confession from them, than

she chased them from her presence, called them unworthy traitors, declared

that their detestable rebellion was of bad example to all princes; and

assured them, that as she had hitherto given them no encouragement, so

should they never thenceforth receive from her any assistance or

protection.[***] Throgmorton alone, whose honor was equal to his

abilities, could not be prevailed on to conceal the part which he had

acted in the enterprise of the Scottish rebels; and being well apprised of

the usual character and conduct of Elizabeth, he had had the precaution to

obtain an order of council to authorize the engagements which he had been

obliged to make with them.[****]

 

The banished lords, finding themselves so harshly treated by Elizabeth,

had recourse to the clemency of their own sovereign; and after some

solicitation and some professions of sincere repentance, the duke of

Chatelrault obtained his pardon, on condition that he should retire into

France. Mary was more implacable against the ungrateful earl of Murray and

the other confederates, on whom she threw the chief blame of the

enterprise; but as she was continually plied with applications from their

friends, and as some of her most judicious partisans in England thought,

that nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom, than the

gentle treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against the Catholic

religion, she agreed to give way to her natural temper, which inclined not

to severity, and she seemed determined to restore them to favor.[*] In

this interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambassador from France, and brought

her advice from her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, to whose opinion she

always paid an extreme deference, by no means to pardon these Protestant

leaders, who had been engaged in a rebellion against her.[**]

 

The two religions, in France, as well as in other parts of Europe, were

rather irritated than tired with their acts of mutual violence; and the

peace granted to the Hugonots, as had been foreseen by Coligny, was

intended only to lull them asleep and prepare the way for their final and

absolute destruction. The queen regent made a pretence of travelling

through the kingdom, in order to visit the provinces, and correct all the

abuses arising from the late civil war; and after having held some

conferences on the frontiers with the duke of Lorraine and the duke of

Savoy, she came to Bayonne, where she was met by her daughter, the queen

of Spain, and the duke of Alva. Nothing appeared in the congress of these

two splendid courts, but gayety, festivity, love, and joy; but amidst

these smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes the most

bloody, and the most destructive to the repose of mankind, that had ever

been thought of in any age or nation. No less than a total and universal

extermination of the Protestants by fire and sword was concerted by Philip

and Catharine of Medicis; and Alva, agreeably to his fierce and sanguinary

disposition, advised the queen regent to commence the execution of this

project, by the immediate massacre of all the leaders of the

Hugonots.[***]

 

But that princess, though equally hardened against every humane sentiment,

would not forego this opportunity of displaying her wit and refined

politics; and she purposed rather by treachery and dissimulation, which

she called address, to lead the Protestants into the snare, and never to

draw the sword till they were totally disabled from resistance. The

cardinal of Lorraine, whose character bore a greater affinity to that of

Alva, was a chief author of this barbarous association against the

reformers; and having connected his hopes of success with the

aggrandizement of his niece, the queen of Scots, he took care that her

measures should correspond to those violent counsels which were embraced

by the other Catholic princes. In consequence of this scheme, he turned

her from the road of clemency, which she intended to have followed, and

made her resolve on the total ruin of the banished lords.[*]

 

1565.

 

A parliament was summoned at Edinburgh for attainting them; and as their

guilt was palpable and avowed, no doubt was entertained but sentence would

be pronounced against them. It was by a sudden and violent incident,

which, in the issue, brought on the ruin of Mary herself, that they were

saved from the rigor of the law.

 

The marriage of the queen of Scots with Lord Darnley was so natural, and

so inviting in all its circumstances, that it had been precipitately

agreed to by that princess and her council; and while she was allured by

his youth, and beauty, and exterior accomplishments, she had at first

overlooked the qualities of his mind, which nowise corresponded to the

excellence of his outward figure. Violent, yet variable in his

resolutions; insolent, yet credulous and easily governed by flatterers; he

was destitute of all gratitude, because he thought no favors equal to his

merit; and being addicted to low pleasures, he was equally incapable of

all true sentiments of love and tenderness.[*] The queen of Scots, in the

first effusions of her fondness, had taken a pleasure in exalting him

beyond measure; she had granted him the title of king; she had joined his

name with her own in all public acts; she intended to have procured him

from the parliament a matrimonial crown; but having leisure afterwards to

remark his weakness and vices, she began to see the danger of her profuse

liberality, and was resolved thenceforth to proceed with more reserve in

the trust which she should confer upon him. His resentment against this

prudent conduct served but the more to increase her disgust: and the young

prince, enraged at her imagined neglects, pointed his vengeance against

every one whom he deemed the cause of this change in her measures and

behavior.

 

There was in the court one David Rizzio, who had of late obtained a very

extraordinary degree of confidence and favor with the queen of Scots. He

was a Piedmontese, of mean birth, son of a teacher of music, himself a

musician; and finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own

country, he had followed into Scotland an ambassador, whom the duke of

Savoy sent thither to pay his compliments to Mary, some time after her

first arrival. He possessed a good ear, and a tolerable voice; and as that

princess found him useful to complete her band of music, she retained him

in her service after the departure of his master. Her secretary for French

despatches having some time after incurred her displeasure, she promoted

Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent opportunities of

approaching her person, and insinuating himself into her favor. He was

shrewd and sensible, as well as aspiring, much beyond his rank and

education; and he made so good use of the access which fortune had

procured him, that he was soon regarded as the chief confidant, and even

minister of the queen. He was consulted on all occasions; no favors could

be obtained but by his intercession; all suitors were obliged to gain him

by presents and flattery; and the man, insolent from his new exaltation,

as well as rapacious in his acquisitions, soon drew on himself the hatred

of the nobility and of the whole kingdom.[*] He had at first employed his

credit to promote Darnley’s marriage; and a firm friendship seemed to be

established between them; but on the subsequent change of the queen’s

sentiments, it was easy for Henry’s friends to persuade him that Rizzio

was the real author of her indifference, and even to rouse in his mind

jealousies of a more dangerous nature. The favorite was of a disagreeable

figure, but was not past his youth;[**] 8 and though the opinion of

his criminal correspondence with Mary might seem of itself unreasonable,

if not absurd, a suspicious husband could find no other means of

accounting for that lavish and imprudent kindness with which she honored

him.

 

The rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, who could admit of no freedoms,

contributed to spread this opinion among the people; and as Rizzio was

universally believed to be a pensionary of the pope’s, and to be deeply

engaged in all schemes against the Protestants, any story to his and

Mary’s disadvantage received an easy credit among the zealots of that

communion. Rizzio, who had connected his interests with the Roman

Catholics, was the declared enemy of the banished lords; and by promoting

the violent prosecutions against them, he had exposed himself to the

animosity of their numerous friends and retainers. A scheme was also

thought to be formed for revoking some exorbitant grants made during the

queen’s minority, and even the nobility, who had seized the ecclesiastical

benefices, began to think themselves less secure in the possession of

them.[*] The earl of Morton, chancellor, was affected by all these

considerations, and still more by a rumor spread abroad, that Mary

intended to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his place, and to bestow that

dignity on a mean and upstart foreigner, ignorant of the laws and language

of the country.[**] So indiscreet had this princess been in her kindness

to Rizzio, that even that strange report met with credit, and proved a

great means of accelerating the ruin of the favorite. Morton, insinuating

himself into Henry’s confidence, employed all his art to inflame the

discontent and jealousy of that prince; and he persuaded him, that the

only means of freeing himself from the indignities under which he labored,

was to bring the base stranger to the fate which he had so well merited,

and which was so passionately desired by the whole nation. George Douglas,

natural brother to the countess of Lenox, concurred in the same advice;

and the Lords Ruthven and Lindesey, being consulted, offered their

assistance in the enterprise; nor was even the earl of Lenox, the king’s

father, averse to the design.[***] But as these conspirators were well

acquainted with Henry’s levity, they engaged him to sign a paper, in which

he avowed the undertaking, as tending to the glory of God and advancement

of religion, and promised to protect them against every consequence which

might ensue upon the assassination of Rizzio.[****] All these measures

being concerted, a messenger was despatched to the banished lords, who

were hovering near the borders; and they were invited by the king to

return to their native country.

 

This design, so atrocious in itself, was rendered still more so by the

circumstances which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the sixth

month of her pregnancy, was supping in private, and had at table the

countess of Argyle, her natural sister, with Rizzio, and others of her

servants. The king entered the room by a private passage, and stood at the

back of Mary’s chair: Lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other

conspirators, being all armed, rushed in after him; and the queen of

Scots, terrified with the appearance, demanded of them the reason of this

rude intrusion. They told her, that they intended no violence against her

person; but meant only to bring that villain, pointing to Rizzio, to his

deserved punishment. Rizzio, aware of the danger, ran behind his mistress,

and seizing her by the waist, called aloud to her for protection; while

she interposed in his behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. The

impatient assassins, regardless of her efforts, rushed upon their prey,

and by overturning every thing which stood in their way, increased the

horror and confusion of the scene. Douglas, seizing Henry’s dagger, stuck

it in the body of Rizzio, who, screaming with fear and agony, was torn

from Mary by the other conspirators, and pushed into the ante-chamber,

where he was despatched with fifty-six wounds.[*]

 

The unhappy princess, informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears,

and said, she would weep no more; she would now think of revenge. The

insult, indeed, upon her person; the stain attempted to be fixed on her

honor; the danger to which her life was exposed, on account of her

pregnancy; were injuries so atrocious and so complicated, that they

scarcely left room for pardon, even from the greatest lenity and mercy.

 

The assassins, apprehensive of Mary’s resentment, detained her prisoner in

the palace; and the king dismissed all who seemed willing to attempt her

rescue, by telling them, that nothing was done without his orders, and

that he would be careful of the queen’s safety. Murray and the banished

lords appeared two days after; and Mary, whose anger was now engrossed by

injuries more recent and violent, was willingly reconciled to them; and

she even received her brother with tenderness and affection. They obtained

an acquittal from parliament, and were reinstated in their honors and

fortunes. The accomplices also in Rizzio’s murder applied to her for a

pardon; but she artfully delayed compliance, and persuaded them, that so

long as she was detained in custody, and was surrounded by guards, any

deed which she should sign would have no validity. Meanwhile she had

gained the confidence of her husband by her persuasion and caresses and no

sooner were the guards withdrawn, than she engaged him to escape with her

in the night-time, and take shelter in Dunbar. Many of her subjects here

offered her their services; and Mary, having collected an army, which the

conspirators had no power to resist, advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged

them to fly into England, where they lived in great poverty and distress.

They made applications, however, to the earl of Bothwell, a new favorite

of Mary’s; and that nobleman, desirous of strengthening his party by the

accession of their interest, was able to pacify her resentment; and he

soon after procured them liberty to return into their own country.[*]

 

The vengeance of the queen of Scots was implacable against her husband

alone, whose person was before disagreeable to her, and who, by his

violation of every tie of gratitude and duty, had now drawn on him her

highest resentment. She engaged him to disown all connections with the

assassins, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publish a

proclamation containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world;[**]

and having thus made him expose himself to universal contempt, and

rendered it impracticable for him ever to acquire the confidence of any

party, she threw him off with disdain and indignation.[***]

 

As if she had been making an escape from him, she suddenly withdrew to

Allca, a seat of the earl of Marre’s; and when Henry followed her thither,

she suddenly returned to Edinburgh and give him every where the strongest

proofs of displeasure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers

in their neglect of him; and she was pleased that his mean equipage and

small train of attendants should draw on him the contempt of the very

populace. He was permitted, however, to have apartments in the Castle of

Edinburgh, which Mary had chosen for the place of her delivery. She there

brought forth a son; and as this was very important news to England, as

well as to Scotland, she immediately despatched Sir James Melvil to carry

intelligence of the happy event to Elizabeth. Melvil tells us, that this

princess, the evening of his arrival in London, had given a ball to her

court at Greenwich, and was displaying all that spirit and alacrity which

usually attended her on these occasions: but when news arrived of the

prince of Scotland’s birth, all her joy was damped: she sunk into

melancholy; she reclined her head upon her arm; and complained to some of

her attendants, that the queen of Scots was mother of a fair son, while

she herself was but a barren stock. Next day, however, at the reception of

the ambassador, she resumed her former dissimulation, put on a joyful

countenance, gave Melvil thanks for the haste he had made in conveying to

her the agreeable intelligence, and expressed the utmost cordiality and

friendship to her sister.[*] Some time after, she despatched the earl of

Bedford, with her kinsman George Gary, son of Lord Hunsdon, in order to

officiate at the baptism of the young prince; and she sent by them some

magnificent presents to the queen of Scots.

 

The birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary’s partisans in

England;[**] and even men of the most opposite parties began to cry aloud

for some settlement of the succession. These humors broke out with great

vehemence in a new session of parliament, held after six prorogations. The

house of peers, which had hitherto forborne to touch on this delicate

point, here took the lead; and the house of commons soon after imitated

the zeal of the lords. Molineux opened the matter in the lower house, and

proposed, that the question of the succession and that of supply should go

hand in hand; as if it were intended to constrain the queen to a

compliance with the request of her parliament.[***] The courtiers

endeavored to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the house, that he

had heard the queen positively affirm, that for the good of her people she

was determined to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave

their testimony to the same purpose; as did also Sir Ambrose Cave,

chancellor of the duchy, and Sir Edward Rogers, comptroller of the

household.[****]

 

Elizabeth’s ambitious and masculine character was so well known, that few

members gave any credit to this intelligence; and it was considered merely

as an artifice, by which she endeavored to retract that positive

declaration which she had made in the beginning of her reign, that she

meant to live and die a virgin. The ministers, therefore, gained nothing

further by this piece of policy, than only to engage the house, for the

sake of decency, to join the question of the queen’s marriage with that of

a settlement of the crown; and the commons were proceeding with great

earnestness in the debate, and had even appointed a committee to confer

with the lords, when express orders were brought them from Elizabeth not

to proceed further in the matter. Cecil told them, that she pledged to the

house the word of a queen for her sincerity in her intentions to marry;

that the appointment of a successor would be attended with great danger to

her person; that she herself had had experience, during the reign of her

sister, how much court was usually paid to the next heir, and what

dangerous sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make of their present

duty to their future prospects; and that she was therefore determined to

delay, till a more proper opportunity, the decision of that important

question.[*] The house was not satisfied with these reasons, and still

less with the command prohibiting them all debate on the subject. Paul

Wentworth, a spirited member, went so far as to question whether such a

prohibition were not an infringement of the liberties and privileges of

the house.[**] Some even ventured to violate that profound respect which

had hitherto been preserved to the queen; and they affirmed, that she was

bound in duty, not only to provide for the happiness of her subjects

during her own life, but also to pay regard to their future security, by

fixing a successor; that by an opposite conduct she showed herself the

step-mother, not the natural parent of her people, and would seem desirous

that England should no longer subsist than she should enjoy the glory and

satisfaction of governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants,

or faint-hearted women, ever stood in fear of their successors; and that

the affections of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every

sovereign, who, laying aside all artifice or by-ends, had courage and

magnanimity to put his sole trust in that honorable and sure defence.[***]

The queen, hearing of these debates, sent for the speaker; and after

reiterating her former prohibition, she bade him inform the house, that if

any member remained still unsatisfied, he might appear before the privy

council, and there give his reasons.[****]

 

As the members showed a disposition, notwithstanding these peremptory

orders, still to proceed upon the question, Elizabeth thought proper, by a

message, to revoke them, and to allow the house liberty of debate.[*] They

were so mollified by this gracious condescension, that they thenceforth

conducted the matter with more calmness and temper, and they even voted

her a supply, to be levied at three payments, of a subsidy and a

fifteenth, without annexing any condition to it.

 

1567.

 

The queen soon after dissolved the parliament, and told them, with some

sharpness in the conclusion, that their proceedings had contained much

dissimulation and artifice; that, under the plausible pretences of

marriage and succession, many of them covered very malevolent intentions

towards her; but that, however, she reaped this advantage from the

attempts of these men, that she could now distinguish her friends from her

enemies. “But do you think,” added she, “that I am unmindful of your

future security, or will be negligent in settling the succession? That is

the chief object of my concern; as I know myself to be liable to

mortality. Or do you apprehend that I meant to encroach on your liberties?

No: it was never my meaning; I only intended to stop you before you

approached the precipice. All things have their time; and though you maybe

blessed with a sovereign more wise or more learned than I, yet I assure

you that no one will ever rule over you who shall be more careful of your

safety. And therefore, henceforward, whether I live to see the like

assembly or no, or whoever holds the reins of government, let me warn you

to beware of provoking your sovereign’s patience, so far as you have done

mine. But I shall now conclude, that, notwithstanding the disgusts I have

received, (for I mean not to part with you in anger), the greater part of

you may assure themselves that they go home in their prince’s good

graces.”[**]

 

Elizabeth carried further her dignity on this occasion. She had received

the subsidy without any condition; but as it was believed that the commons

had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to yield to their

requests, she thought proper, on her refusal, voluntarily to remit the

third payment; and she said, that money in her subjects’ purses was as

good to her as in her own exchequer.[***]

 

But though the queen was able to elude, for the present, the applications

of parliament, the friends of the queen of Scots multiplied every day in

England; and besides the Catholics, many of whom kept a treasonable

correspondence with her, and were ready to rise at her command,[*] the

court itself of Elizabeth was full of her avowed partisans. The duke of

Norfolk, the earls of Leicester, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumberland, Sir

Nicholas Throgmorton, and most of the considerable men in England, except

Cecil, seemed convinced of the necessity of declaring her the successor.

None but the more zealous Protestants adhered either to the countess of

Hertford, or to her aunt, Eleanor, countess of Cumberland; and as the

marriage of the former seemed liable to some objections, and had been

declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that side, with the prospect

of new disputes concerning the succession. Mary’s behavior, also, so

moderate towards the Protestants, and so gracious towards all men, had

procured her universal respect;[**] and the public was willing to ascribe

any imprudences into which she had fallen to her youth and inexperience.

But all these flattering prospects were blasted by the subsequent

incidents; where her egregious indiscretions, shall I say, or atrocious

crimes, threw her from the height of her prosperity and involved her in

infamy and in ruin.

 

The earl of Bothwell was of a considerable family and power in Scotland;

and though not distinguished by any talents either of a civil or military

nature, he had made a figure in that party which opposed the greatness of

the earl of Murray and the more rigid reformers. He was a man of

profligate manners; had involved his opulent fortune in great debts, and

even reduced himself to beggary by his profuse expenses;[***] and seemed

to have no resource but in desperate counsels and enterprises.

 

He had been accused more than once of an attempt to assassinate Murray;

and though the frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish

somewhat the credit due to any particular imputation, they prove

sufficiently the prevalence of that detestable practice in Scotland, and

may in that view serve to render such rumors the more credible. This man

had of late acquired the favor and entire confidence of Mary; and all her

measures were directed by his advice and authority. Reports were spread of

more particular intimacies between them; and these reports gained ground

from the continuance, or rather increase, of her hatred towards her

husband.[*] That young prince was reduced to such a state of desperation

by the neglects which he underwent from his queen and the courtiers, that

he had once resolved to fly secretly into France or Spain, and had even

provided a vessel for that purpose.[**] Some of the most considerable

nobility, on the other hand, observing her rooted aversion to him, had

proposed some expedients for a divorce, and though Mary is said to have

spoken honorably on the occasion, and to have embraced the proposal no

further than it should be found consistent with her own honor and her

son’s legitimacy,[***] men were inclined to believe, that the difficulty

of finding proper means for effecting that purpose, was the real cause of

laying aside all further thoughts of it. So far were the suspicions

against her carried, that when Henry, discouraged with the continual

proofs of her hatred, left the court and retired to Glasgow, an illness of

an extraordinary nature, with which he was seized immediately on his

arrival in that place, was universally ascribed by her enemies to a dose

of poison, which, it was pretended, she had administered to him.

 

While affairs were in this situation, all those who wished well to her

character, or to public tranquillity, were extremely pleased, and somewhat

surprised, to hear that a friendship was again conciliated between them,

that she had taken a journey to Glasgow on purpose to visit him during his

sickness, that she behaved towards him with great tenderness, that she had

brought him along with her, and that she appeared thenceforth determined

to live with him on a footing more suitable to the connections between

them. Henry, naturally uxorious, and not distrusting this sudden

reconciliation, put himself implicitly into her hands, and attended her to

Edinburgh. She lived in the palace of Holyrood House; but as the situation

of the palace was low, and the concourse of people about the court was

necessarily attended with noise, which might disturb him in his present

infirm state of health, these reasons were assigned for fitting up an

apartment for him in a solitary house at some distance, called the Kirk of

Field. Mary here gave him marks of kindness and attachment; she conversed

cordially with him; and she lay some nights in a room below his; but on

the ninth of February, she told him that she would pass that night in the

palace, because the marriage of one of her servants was there to be

celebrated in her presence. About two o’clock in the morning, the whole

town was much alarmed at hearing a great noise; and was still more

astonished, when it was discovered that the noise came from the king’s

house, which was blown up by gunpowder; that his dead body was found at

some distance in a neighboring field; and that no marks, either of fire,

contusion, or violence appeared upon it.[*]

 

No doubt could be entertained but Henry was murdered; and general

conjecture soon pointed towards the earl of Bothwell as the author of the

crime.[**] But as his favor with Mary was visible, and his power great, no

one ventured to declare openly his sentiments; and all men remained in

silence and mute astonishment. Voices, however, were heard in the streets,

during the darkness of the night, proclaiming Bothwell, and even Mary

herself, to be murderers of the king; bills were secretly affixed on the

walls to the same purpose; offers were made, that, upon giving proper

securities, his guilt should be openly proved; but after one proclamation

from the court, offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would

discover the author of that villany, greater vigilance was employed in

searching out the spreaders of the libels and reports against Bothwell and

the queen, than in tracing the contrivers of the king’s assassination, or

detecting the regicides.[***]

 

The earl of Lenox, who lived at a distance from court in poverty and

contempt, was roused by the report of his son’s murder, and wrote to the

queen, imploring speedy justice against the assassins; among whom he named

the earl of Bothwell, Sir James Balfour, and Gilbert Balfour his brother,

David Chalmers, and four others of the queen’s household; all of them

persons who had been mentioned in the bills affixed to the walls at

Edinburgh.[****]

Mary took his demand of speedy justice in a very literal sense, and

allowing only fifteen days for the examination of this important affair,

she sent a citation to Lenox, requiring him to appear in court, and prove

his charge against Bothwell.[*] This nobleman, meanwhile, and all the

other persons accused by Lenox, enjoyed their full liberty;[**] Bothwell

himself was continually surrounded with armed men; [***] took his place in

council;[****] lived during some time in the house with Mary;[v] and

seemed to possess all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her. Even

the Castle of Edinburgh, a place of great consequence in this critical

time, was intrusted to him, and under him, to his creature, Sir James

Balfour, who had himself been publicly charged as an accomplice in the

king’s murder.[v*] Lenox, who had come as far as Stirling with a view of

appearing at the trial, was informed of all these circumstances; and

reflecting on the small train which attended him, he began to entertain

very just apprehensions from the power, insolence, and temerity of his

enemy. He wrote to Mary, desiring that the day of trial might be

prorogued; and conjured her, by all the regard which she bore to her own

honor, to employ more leisure and deliberation in determining a question

of such extreme moment.[v**] No regard was paid to his application: the

jury was enclosed, of which the earl of Caithness was chancellor; and

though Lenox, foreseeing this precipitation, had ordered Cunningham, one

of his retinue, to appear in court, and protest in his name against the

acquittal of the criminal, the jury proceeded to a verdict.[v***] The

verdict was such as it behoved them to give, where neither accuser nor

witness appeared; and Bothwell was absolved from the king’s murder. The

jury, however, apprehensive that their verdict would give great scandal,

and perhaps expose them afterwards to some danger, entered a protest, in

which they represented the necessity of their proceedings.[v****]

 

It is remarkable, that the indictment was laid against Bothwell for

committing the crime on the ninth of February, not the tenth, the real day

on which Henry was assassinated.[*] The interpretation generally put upon

this error, too gross, it was thought, to have proceeded from mistake,

was, that the secret council by whom Mary was governed, not trusting

entirely to precipitation, violence, and authority, had provided this

plea, by which they insured, at all adventures, a plausible pretence for

acquitting Bothwell.

 

Two days after this extraordinary transaction, a parliament was held; and

though the verdict in favor of Bothwell was attended with such

circumstances as strongly confirmed, rather than diminished, the general

opinion of his guilt, he was the person chosen to carry the royal sceptre

on the first meeting of that national assembly.[**] In this parliament a

rigorous act was made against those who set up defamatory bills; but no

notice was taken of the king’s murder.[***] The favor which Mary openly

bore to Bothwell kept every one in awe; and the effects of this terror

appeared more plainly in another transaction, which ensued immediately

upon the dissolution of the parliament. A bond or association was framed;

in which the subscribers, after relating the acquittal of Bothwell by a

legal trial, and mentioning a further offer which he had made, to prove

his innocence by single combat, oblige themselves, in case any person

should afterwards impute to him the king’s murder, to defend him with

their whole power against such calumniators. After this promise, which

implied no great assurance in Bothwell of his own innocence, the

subscribers mentioned the necessity of their queen’s marriage, in order to

support the government; and they recommended Bothwell to her as a

husband.[****] This paper was subscribed by all the considerable nobility

there present. In a country divided by violent factions, such a

concurrence in favor of one nobleman, nowise distinguished above the rest,

except by his flagitious conduct, could never have been obtained, had not

every one been certain, at least firmly persuaded, that Mary was fully

determined on this measure.[v] 9 Nor would such a motive have sufficed to

influence men, commonly so stubborn and untractable, had they not been

taken by surprise, been ignorant of each other’s sentiments, and overawed

by the present power of the court, and by the apprehensions of further

violence from persons so little governed by any principles of honor and

humanity. Even with all these circumstances, the subscription to this

paper may justly be regarded as a reproach to the nation.

 

The subsequent measures of Bothwell were equally precipitate and

audacious. Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a visit to her son, he

assembled a body of eight hundred horse, on pretence of pursuing some

robbers on the borders; and having waylaid her on her return, he seized

her person near Edinburgh, and carried her to Dunbar, with an avowed

design of forcing her to yield to his purpose. Sir James Melvil, one of

her retinue, was carried along with her, and says not that he saw any

signs of reluctance or constraint; he was even informed, as he tells us,

by Bothwell’s officers, that the whole transaction was managed in concert

with her.[*] A woman, indeed, of that spirit and resolution which is

acknowledged to belong to Mary, does not usually, on these occasions, give

such marks of opposition to real violence as can appear any wise doubtful

or ambiguous. Some of the nobility, however, in order to put matters to

further trial, sent her a private message, in which they told her, that if

in reality she lay under force, they would use all their efforts to rescue

her. Her answer was, that she had indeed been carried to Dunbar by

violence, but ever since her arrival had been so well treated that she

willingly remained with Bothwell.[**] No one gave himself thenceforth any

concern to relieve her from a captivity which was believed to proceed

entirely from her own approbation and connivance.

 

This unusual conduct was at first ascribed to Mary’s sense of the infamy

attending her purposed marriage, and her desire of finding some color to

gloss over the irregularity of her conduct. But a pardon, given to

Bothwell a few days after, made the public carry their conjectures

somewhat further. In this deed, Bothwell received a pardon for the

violence committed on the queen’s person, and for “all other crimes;” a

clause by which the murder of the king was indirectly forgiven. The rape

was then conjectured to have been only a contrivance, in order to afford a

pretence for indirectly remitting a crime, of which it would have appeared

scandalous to make openly any mention.[***]

 

These events passed with such rapidity, that men had no leisure to admire

sufficiently one incident, when they were surprised with a new one equally

rare and uncommon. There still, however, remained one difficulty which it

was not easy to foresee how the queen and Bothwell, determined as they

were to execute their shameful purpose, could find expedients to overcome.

The man who had procured the subscription of the nobility, recommending

him as a husband to the queen, and who had acted this seeming violence on

her person, in order to force her consent, had been married two years

before to another woman; to a woman of merit, of a noble family, sister to

the earl of Huntley. But persons blinded by passion, and infatuated with

crime, soon shake off all appearance of decency. A suit was commenced for

a divorce between Bothwell and his wife; and this suit was opened at the

same instant in two different, or rather opposite courts; in the court of

the archbishop of St. Andrew’s, which was Popish, and governed itself by

the canon law; and in the new consistorial or commissariot court, which

was Protestant, and was regulated by the principles of the reformed

teachers. The plea advanced in each court was so calculated as to suit the

principles which there prevailed; in the archbishop’s court, the pretence

of consanguinity was employed, because Bothwell was related to his wife in

the fourth degree; in the commissariot court, the accusation of adultery

was made use of against him. The parties, too, who applied for the

divorce, were different in the different courts: Bothwell was the person

who sued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the suit in both

courts was opened, pleaded, examined, and decided, with the utmost

precipitation; and a sentence of divorce was pronounced in four days.[*]

 

The divorce being thus obtained, it was thought proper that Mary should be

conducted to Edinburgh, and should there appear before the courts of

judicature, and should acknowledge herself restored to entire freedom.

This was understood to be contrived in a view of obviating all doubts with

regard to the validity of her marriage. Orders were then given to publish

in the church the banns between the queen and the duke of Orkney; for that

was the title which he now bore; and Craig, a minister of Edinburgh, was

applied to for that purpose. This clergyman, not content with having

refused compliance, publicly in his sermons condemned the marriage, and

exhorted all who had access to the queen, to give her their advice against

so scandalous an alliance. Being called before the council to answer for

this liberty, he showed a courage which might cover all the nobles with

shame, on account of their tameness and servility. He said that, by the

rules of the church, the earl of Bothwell, being convicted of adultery,

could not be permitted to marry; that the divorce between him and his

former wife was plainly procured by collusion, as appeared by the

precipitation of the sentence, and the sudden conclusion of his marriage

with the queen; and that all the suspicions which prevailed with regard to

the king’s murder, and the queen’s concurrence in the former rape, would

thence receive undoubted confirmation. He therefore exhorted Bothwell, who

was present, no longer to persevere in his present criminal enterprises;

and turning his discourse to the other counsellors, he charged them to

employ all their influence with the queen, in order to divert her from a

measure which would load her with eternal infamy and dishonor. Not

satisfied even with this admonition, he took the first opportunity of

informing the public, from the pulpit, of the whole transaction; and

expressed to them his fears that, notwithstanding all remonstrances, their

sovereign was still obstinately bent on her fatal purpose. “For himself,”

he said, “he had already discharged his conscience; and yet again would

take heaven and earth to witness that he abhorred and detested that

marriage as scandalous and hateful in the sight of mankind; but since the

great, as he perceived, either by their flattery or silence, gave

countenance to the measure, he besought the faithful to pray fervently to

the Almighty that a resolution, taken contrary to all law, reason, and

good conscience, might, by the divine blessing, be turned to the comfort

and benefit of the church and kingdom.” These speeches offended the court

extremely; and Craig was anew summoned before the council, to answer for

his temerity in thus passing the bounds of his commission. But he told

them, that the bounds of his commission were the word of God, good laws,

and natural reason; and were the Queen’s marriage tried by any of these

standards, it would appear infamous and dishonorable, and would so be

esteemed by the whole world. The council were so overawed by this heroic

behavior in a private clergyman, that they dismissed him without further

censure or punishment.[*]

 

But though this transaction might have recalled Bothwell and the queen of

Scots from their infatuation, and might have instructed them in the

dispositions of the people, as well as in their own inability to oppose

them, they were still resolute to rush forward to their own manifest

destruction. The marriage was solemnized by the bishop of Orkney, a

Protestant, who was afterwards deposed by the church for this scandalous

compliance. Few of the nobility appeared at the ceremony: they had most of

them, either from shame or fear, retired to their own houses. The French

ambassador, Le Croc, an aged gentleman of honor and character, could not

be prevailed on, though a dependent of the house of Guise, to countenance

the marriage by his presence.[*] Elizabeth remonstrated, by friendly

letters and messages, against the marriage.[**] The court of France made

like opposition; but Mary, though on all other occasions she was extremely

obsequious to the advice of her relations in that country, was here

determined to pay no regard to their opinion.

 

The news of these transactions, being carried to foreign countries, filled

Europe with amazement, and threw infamy, not only on the principal actors

in them, but also on the whole nation, who seemed, by their submission and

silence, and even by their declared approbation, to give their sanction to

these scandalous practices.[***] The Scots who resided abroad met with

such reproaches, that they durst nowhere appear in public; and they

earnestly exhorted their countrymen at home to free them from the public

odium, by bringing to condign punishment the authors of such atrocious

crimes. This intelligence, with a little more leisure for reflection,

roused men from their lethargy; and the rumors which, from the very

beginning,[****] had been spread against Mary, as if she had concurred in

the king’s murder, seemed now, by the subsequent transactions, to have

received a strong confirmation and authority.

 

It was every where said, that even though no particular and direct proofs

had as yet been produced of the queen’s guilt, the whole tenor of her late

conduct was sufficient, not only to beget suspicion, but to produce entire

conviction against her: that her sudden resolution of being reconciled to

her husband, whom before she had long and justly hated; her bringing him

to court, from which she had banished him by neglects and rigors; her

fitting up separate apartments for him; were all of them circumstances

which, though trivial in themselves, yet, being compared with the

subsequent events, bore a very unfavorable aspect for her: that the least

which, after the king’s murder, might have been expected in her situation,

was a more than usual caution in her measures, and an extreme anxiety to

punish the real assassins, in order to free herself from all reproach and

suspicion: that no woman who had any regard to her character, would allow

a man, publicly accused of her husband’s murder, so much as to approach

her presence, far less give him a share in her councils, and endow him

with favor and authority that an acquittal, merely in the absence of

accusers, was very ill fitted to satisfy the public; especially if that

absence proceeded from a designed precipitation of the sentence, and from

the terror which her known friendship for the criminal had infused into

every one: that the very mention of her marriage to such a person, in such

circumstances, was horrible; and the contrivances of extorting a consent

from the nobility, and of concerting a rape, were gross artifices, more

proper to discover her guilt than prove her innocence: that where a woman

thus shows a consciousness of merited reproach, and instead of correcting,

provides only thin glosses to cover her exceptionable conduct, she betrays

a neglect of fame, which must either be the effect or the cause of the

most shameful enormities: that to espouse a man who had, a few days

before, been so scandalously divorced from his wife, who, to say the

least, was believed to have a few months before assassinated her husband,

was so contrary to the plainest rules of behavior, that no pretence of

indiscretion or imprudence could account for such a conduct: that a woman

who, so soon after her husband’s death, though not attended with any

extraordinary circumstances, contracts a marriage which might in itself be

the most blameless, cannot escape severe censure; but one who overlooks

for her pleasure so many other weighty considerations, was equally

capable, in gratifying her appetites, to neglect every regard to honor and

humanity: that Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the

public with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences which would

every where be drawn from her conduct; and therefore, if she still

continued to pursue measures which gave such just offence, she ratified by

her actions, as much as she could by the most formal confession, all the

surmises and imputations of her enemies: that a prince was here murdered

in the face of the world; Bothwell alone was suspected and accused; if he

were innocent, nothing could absolve him, either in Mary’s eyes or those

of the public, but the detection and conviction of the real assassin: yet

no inquiry was made to that purpose, though a parliament had been

assembled; the sovereign and wife was here plainly silent from guilt, the

people from terror: that the only circumstance which opposed all these

presumptions, or rather proofs, was the benignity and goodness of her

preceding behavior, which seemed to remove her from all suspicions of such

atrocious inhumanity; but that the characters of men were extremely

variable, and persons guilty of the worst actions were not always

naturally of the worst and most criminal dispositions; that a woman who,

in a critical and dangerous moment, had sacrificed her honor to a man of

abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the

commission of the most enormous crimes, and was in reality no longer at

her own disposal: and that, though one supposition was still left to

alleviate her blame; namely, that Bothwell, presuming on her affection

towards him, had of himself committed the crime, and had never

communicated it to her; yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man

whom she had long known, could not easily be accounted for, without

supposing some degree of preceding guilt; and as it appeared that she was

not afterwards restrained, either by shame or prudence, from incurring the

highest reproach and danger, it was not likely that a sense of duty or

humanity would have a more powerful influence over her.

 

These were the sentiments which prevailed throughout Scotland: and as the

Protestant teachers, who had great authority, had long borne an animosity

to Mary, the opinion of her guilt was by that means the more widely

diffused, and made the deeper impression on the people. Some attempts made

by Bothwell, and, as is pretended, with her consent, to get the young

prince into his power, excited the most serious attention; and the

principal nobility, even many of those who had formerly been constrained

to sign the application in favor of Bothwells marriage, met at Stirling,

and formed an association for protecting the prince, and punishing the

king’s murderers.[*]

 

The earl of Athole himself, a known Catholic, was the first author of this

confederacy, the earls of Argyle, Morton, Marre, Glencairne, the lords

Boyd, Lindesey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of Grange, Tulibardine, and

Secretary Lidington, entered zealously into it. The earl of Murray,

foreseeing such turbulent times, and being desirous to keep free of these

dangerous factions, had some time before desired and obtained Mary’s

permission to retire into France.

 

Lord Hume was first in arms; and leading a body of eight hundred horse,

suddenly environed the queen of Scots and Bothwell, in the Castle of

Borthwick. They found means of making their escape to Dunbar; while the

confederate lords were assembling their troops at Edinburgh, and taking

measures to effect their purpose. Had Bothwell been so prudent as to keep

within the fortress of Dunbar, his enemies must have dispersed for want of

pay and subsistence; but hearing that the associated lords were fallen

into distress, he was so rash as to take the field, and advance towards

them. The armies met at Carberry Hill, about six miles from Edinburgh; and

Mary soon became sensible that her own troops disapproved of her cause,

and were averse to spill their blood in the quarrel.[*] After some

bravadoes of Bothwell, where he discovered very little courage, she saw no

resource but that of holding a conference with Kirkaldy of Grange, and of

putting herself, upon some general promises, into the hands of the

confederates. She was conducted to Edinburgh, amidst the insults of the

populace; who reproached her with her crimes, and even held before her

eyes, which way soever she turned, a banner, on which were painted the

murder of her husband and the distress of her infant son.[**] Mary,

overwhelmed with her calamities, had recourse to tears and lamentations.

Meanwhile Bothwell, during her conference with Grange, fled unattended to

Dunbar; and fitting out a few small ships, set sail for the Orkneys, where

he subsisted during some time by piracy. He was pursued thither by Grange,

and his ship was taken, with several of his servants; who afterwards

discovered all the circumstances of the king’s murder, and were punished

for the crime.[***] Bothwell himself escaped in a boat, and found means to

get a passage to Denmark, where he was thrown into prison, lost his

senses, and died miserably about ten years after; an end worthy of his

flagitious conduct and behavior.

 

The queen of Scots, now in the hands of an enraged faction met with such

treatment as a sovereign may naturally expect from subjects, who have

their future security to provide for, as well as their present animosity

to gratify. It is pretended that she behaved with a spirit very little

suitable to her condition, avowed her inviolable attachment to

Bothwell,[*] and even wrote him a letter, which the lords intercepted,

wherein she declared, that she would endure any extremity, nay, resign her

dignity and crown itself, rather than relinquish his affections.[**] The

malecontents, finding the danger to which they were exposed in case Mary

should finally prevail, thought themselves obliged to proceed with rigor

against her; and they sent her next day under a guard to the Castle of

Lochlevin, situated in a lake of that name. The mistress of the house was

mother to the earl of Murray; and as she pretended to have been lawfully

married to the late king of Scots, she naturally bore an animosity to

Mary, and treated her with the utmost harshness and severity.

 

Elizabeth, who was fully informed of all those incidents, seemed touched

with compassion towards the unfortunate queen; and all her fears and

jealousies being now laid asleep, by the consideration of that ruin and

infamy in which Mary’s conduct had involved her, she began to reflect on

the instability of human affairs, the precarious state of royal grandeur,

the danger of encouraging rebellious subjects; and she resolved to employ

her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy kinswoman. She

sent Sir Nicholas Throgmorton ambassador to Scotland, in order to

remonstrate both with Mary and the associated lords; and she gave him

instructions, which, though mixed with some lofty pretensions, were full

of that good sense which was so natural to her, and of that generosity

which the present interesting conjuncture had called forth. She empowered

him to declare[*] in her name to Mary, that the late conduct of that

princess, so enormous, and in every respect so unjustifiable, had given

her the highest offence; and though she felt the movements of pity towards

her, she had once determined never to interpose in her affairs, either by

advice or assistance, but to abandon her entirely, as a person whose

condition was totally desperate, and honor irretrievable.

 

That she was well assured that other foreign princes, Mary’s near

relations, had embraced the same resolution; but, for her part, the late

events had touched her heart with more tender sympathy, and had made her

adopt measures more favorable to the liberty and interests of the unhappy

queen: that she was determined not to see her oppressed by her rebellious

subjects, but would employ all her good offices, and even her power, to

redeem her from captivity, and place her in such a condition as would at

once be compatible with her dignity and the safety of her subjects: that

she conjured her to lay aside all thoughts of revenge, except against the

murderers of her husband; and as she herself was his near relation, she

was better entitled than the subjects of Mary to interpose her authority

on that head; and she therefore besought that princess, if she had any

regard to her own honor and safety, not to oppose so just and reasonable a

demand: that after those two points were provided for, her own liberty and

the punishment of her husband’s assassins, the safety of her infant son

was next to be considered; and there seemed no expedient more proper for

that purpose, than sending him to be educated in England: and that,

besides the security which would attend his removal from a scene of

faction and convulsions, there were many other beneficial consequences,

which it was easy to foresee as the result of his education in that

country.[*]

 

The remonstrances which Throgmorton was instructed to make to the

associated lords, were entirely conformable to these sentiments which

Elizabeth entertained in Mary’s favor. She empowered him to tell them,

that whatever blame she might throw on Mary’s conduct, any opposition to

their sovereign was totally unjustifiable, and incompatible with all order

and good government: that it belonged not to them to reform, much less to

punish, the maleadministration of their prince; and the only arms which

subjects could in any case lawfully employ against the supreme authority,

were entreaties, counsels, and representations: that if these expedients

failed, they were next to appeal by their prayers to Heaven, and to wait

with patience till the Almighty, in whose hands are the hearts of princes,

should be pleased to turn them to justice and to mercy. That she

inculcated not this doctrine because she herself was interested in its

observance, but because it was universally received in all well-governed

states, and was essential to the preservation of civil society: that she

required them to restore their queen to liberty; and promised, in that

case, to concur with them in all proper expedients for regulating the

government, for punishing the king’s murderers, and for guarding the life

and liberty of the infant prince: and that, if the services which she had

lately rendered the Scottish nation, in protecting them from foreign

usurpation, were duly considered by them, they would repose confidence in

her good offices, and would esteem themselves blameworthy in having

hitherto made no application to her.[*]

 

Elizabeth, besides these remonstrances, sent by Throgmorton some articles

of accommodation, which he was to propose to both parties, as expedients

for the settlement of public affairs; and though these articles contained

some important restraints on the sovereign power, they were in the main

calculated for Mary’s advantage, and were sufficiently indulgent to

her.[**] The associated lords, who determined to proceed with greater

severity, were apprehensive of Elizabeth’s partiality; and being sensible

that Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful

princess,[***] they thought proper, after several affected delays, to

refuse the English ambassador all access to her. There were four different

schemes proposed in Scotland for the treatment of the captive queen: one,

that she should be restored to her authority under very strict

limitations: the second, that she should be obliged to resign her crown to

the prince, be banished the kingdom, and be confined either to France or

England; with assurances from the sovereign in whose dominions she should

reside, that she should make no attempts to the disturbance of the

established government: the third, that she should be publicly tried for

her crimes, of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted proof, and be

sentenced to perpetual imprisonment: the fourth was still more severe, and

required that, after her trial and condemnation, capital punishment should

be inflicted upon her.[****] Throgmorton supported the mildest proposal;

but though he promised his mistress’s guaranty for the performance of

articles, threatened the ruling party with immediate vengeance in case of

refusal,[v] and warned them not to draw on themselves, by their violence,

the public reproach which now lay upon their queen, he found that,

excepting Secretary Lidington, he had not the good fortune to convince any

of the leaders.

 

All counsels seemed to tend towards the more severe expedients; and the

preachers, in particular, drawing their examples from the rigorous maxims

of the Old Testament, which can only be warranted by particular

revelations, inflamed the minds of the people against their unhappy

sovereign.[*]

 

There were several pretenders to the regency of the young prince after the

intended deposition of Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that authority as

grandfather to the prince: the duke of Chatelrault, who was absent in

France, had pretensions as next heir to the crown: but the greatest number

of the associated lords inclined to the earl of Murray, in whose capacity

they had entire trust, and who possessed the confidence of the preachers

and more zealous reformers. All measures being therefore concerted, three

instruments were sent to Mary, by the hands of Lord Lindesey and Sir

Robert Melvil; by one of which she was to resign the crown in favor of her

son, by another to appoint Murray regent, by the third to name a council,

which should administer the government till his arrival in Scotland. The

queen of Scots, seeing no prospect of relief, lying justly under

apprehensions for her life, and believing that no deed which she executed

during her captivity could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plentiful

effusion of tears, to sign these three instruments; and she took not the

trouble of inspecting any one of them.[**] In consequence of this forced

resignation, the young prince was proclaimed king, by the name of James

VI. He was soon after crowned at Stirling, and the earl of Morton took in

his name the coronation oath; in which a promise to extirpate heresy was

not forgotten. Some republican pretensions, in favor of the people’s

power, were countenanced in this ceremony;[***] and a coin was soon after

struck, on which the famous saying of Trajan was inscribed, Pro me; si

merear, in me; “For me; if I deserve it, against me.”[****] Throgmorton

had orders from his mistress not to assist at the coronation of the king

of Scots.[v]

 

The council of regency had not long occasion to exercise their authority.

The earl of Murray arrived from France, and took possession of his high

office. He paid a visit to the captive queen, and spoke to her in a manner

which better suited her past conduct than her present condition. This

harsh treatment quite extinguished in her breast any remains of affection

towards him.[*] Murray proceeded afterwards to break, in a more public

manner, all terms of decency with her. He summoned a parliament; and that

assembly, after voting that she was undoubtedly an accomplice in her

husband’s murder, condemned her to imprisonment, ratified her demission of

the crown, and acknowledged her son for king, and Murray for regent.[**]

The regent, a man of vigor and abilities, employed himself successfully in

reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir James Balfour to surrender the Castle

of Edinburgh: he constrained the garrison of Dunbar to open their gates;

and he demolished that fortress.

 

But though every thing thus bore a favorable aspect to the new government,

and all men seemed to acquiesce in Murray’s authority, a violent

revolution, however necessary, can never be effected without great

discontents; and it was not likely that, in a country where the

government, in its most settled state, possessed a very disjointed

authority, a new establishment should meet with no interruption or

disturbance. Few considerable men of the nation seemed willing to support

Mary, so long as Bothwell was present; but the removal of that obnoxious

nobleman had altered the sentiments of many. The duke of Chatelrault,

being disappointed of the regency, bore no good will to Murray; and the

same sentiments were embraced by all his numerous retainers. Several of

the nobility, finding that others had taken the lead among the

associators, formed a faction apart, and opposed the prevailing power; and

besides their being moved by some remains of duty and affection towards

Mary, the malecontent lords, observing every thing carried to extremity

against her, were naturally led to embrace her cause, and shelter

themselves under her authority. All who retained any propensity to the

Catholic religion were induced to join this party; and even the people in

general, though they had formerly either detested Mary’s crimes or blamed

her imprudence, were now inclined to compassionate her present situation,

and lamented that a person possessed of so many amiable accomplishments,

joined to such high dignity, should be treated with such extreme

severity.[***]

 

Animated by all these motives, many of the principal nobility now

adherents to the queen of Scots, met at Hamilton, and concerted measures

for supporting the cause of that princess.

 

1568.

 

While these humors were in fermentation, Mary was employed in contrivances

for effecting her escape; and she engaged, by her charms and caresses, a

young gentleman, George Douglas, brother to the laird of Lochlevin, to

assist her in that enterprise. She even went so far as to give him hopes

of espousing her, after her marriage with Bothwell should be dissolved on

the plea of force; and she proposed this expedient to the regent, who

rejected it. Douglas, however, persevered in his endeavors to free her

from captivity; and having all opportunities of access to the house, he

was at last successful in the undertaking. He conveyed her in disguise

into a small boat, and himself rowed her ashore. She hastened to Hamilton;

and the news of her arrival in that place being immediately spread abroad,

many of the nobility flocked to her with their forces. A bond of

association for her defence was signed by the earls of Argyle, Huntley,

Eglington, Crawford, Cassilis, Rothes, Montrose, Sutherland, Erroi, nine

bishops, and nine barons, besides many of the most considerable gentry.[*]

And in a few days, an army, to the number of six thousand men, was

assembled under her standard.

 

Elizabeth was no sooner informed of Mary’s escape, than she discovered her

resolution of persevering in the same generous and friendly measures which

she had hitherto pursued. If she had not employed force against the regent

during the imprisonment of that princess, she had been chiefly withheld by

the fear of pushing him to greater extremities against her;[**] but she

had proposed to the court of France an expedient, which, though less

violent, would have been no less effectual for her service: she desired

that France and England should by concert cut off all commerce with the

Scots, till they should do justice to their injured sovereign.[***]

 

She now despatched Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good offices,

and the assistance of her forces, to Mary; but as she apprehended the

entrance of French troops into the kingdom, she desired that the

controversy between the queen of Scots and her subjects might by that

princess be referred entirely to her arbitration, and that no foreign

succors should be introduced into Scotland.[*]

 

But Elizabeth had not leisure to exert fully her efforts in favor of Mary.

The regent made haste to assemble forces; and notwithstanding that his

army was inferior in number to that of the queen of Scots, he took the

field against her. A battle was fought at Langside, near Glasgow, which

was entirely decisive in favor of the regent; and though Murray, after his

victory, stopped the bloodshed, yet was the action followed by a total

dispersion of the queen’s party. That unhappy princess fled southwards

from the field of battle with great precipitation, and came with a few

attendants to the borders of England. She here deliberated concerning her

next measures, which would probably prove so important to her future

happiness or misery. She found it impossible to remain in her own kingdom:

she had an aversion, in her present wretched condition, to return into

France, where she had formerly appeared with so much splendor; and she was

not, besides, provided with a vessel which could safely convey her

thither: the late generous behavior of Elizabeth made her hope for

protection, and even assistance, from that quarter;[**] and as the present

fears from her domestic enemies were the most urgent, she overlooked all

other considerations, and embraced the resolution of taking shelter in

England. She embarked on board a fishing-boat in Galloway, and landed the

same day at Workington, in Cumberland, about thirty miles from Carlisle,

whence she immediately despatched a messenger to London, notifying her

arrival, desiring leave to visit Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in

consequence of former professions of friendship made her by that princess.

 

Elizabeth now found herself in a situation when it was become necessary to

take some decisive resolution with regard to her treatment of the queen of

Scots; and as she had hitherto, contrary to the opinion of Cecil, attended

more to the motives of generosity than of policy,[***] she was engaged by

that prudent minister to weigh anew all the considerations which occurred

in this critical conjuncture.

 

He represented, that the party which had dethroned Mary, and had at

present assumed the government of Scotland, were always attached to the

English alliance, and were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of

interest, to persevere in their connection with Elizabeth: that though

Murray and his friends might complain of some unkind usage during their

banishment in England, they would easily forget these grounds of quarrel,

when they reflected, that Elizabeth was the only ally on whom they could

safely rely, and that their own queen, by her attachment to the Catholic

faith, and by her other connections, excluded them entirely from the

friendship of France, and even from that of Spain: that Mary, on the other

hand, even before her violent breach with her Protestant subjects, was in

secret entirely governed by the counsels of the house of Guise, much more

would she implicitly comply with their views, when, by her own ill

conduct, the power of that family and of the zealous Catholics was become

her sole resource and security: that her pretensions to the English crown

would render her a dangerous instrument in their hands; and, were she once

able to suppress the Protestants in her own kingdom, she would unite the

Scottish and English Catholics, with those of all foreign states, in a

confederacy against the religion and government of England; that it

behoved Elizabeth, therefore, to proceed with caution in the design of

restoring her rival to the throne; and to take care, both that this

enterprise, if undertaken, should be effected by English forces alone, and

that full securities should beforehand be provided for the reformers and

the reformation in Scotland: that, above all, it was necessary to guard

carefully the person of that princess; lest, finding this unexpected

reserve in the English friendship, she should suddenly take the resolution

of flying into France, and should attempt by foreign force to recover

possession of her authority: that her desperate fortunes and broken

reputation fitted her for any attempt; and her resentment, when she should

find herself thus deserted by the queen, would concur with her ambition

and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting, as well as powerful enemy

to the English government: that if she were once abroad, in the hands of

enterprising Catholics, the attack on England would appear to her as easy

as that on Scotland; and the only method, she must imagine of recovering

her native kingdom, would be to acquire that crown to which she would deem

herself equally entitled: that a neutrality in such interesting

situations, though it might be pretended, could never, without the most

extreme danger, be upheld by the queen; and the detention of Mary was

equally requisite whether the power of England were to be employed in her

favor, or against her: that nothing, indeed, was more becoming a great

prince than generosity; yet the suggestions of this noble principle could

never, without imprudence, be consulted in such delicate circumstances as

those in which the queen was at present placed; where her own safety and

the interests of her people were intimately concerned in every resolution

which she embraced: that though the example of successful rebellion,

especially in a neighboring country, could nowise be agreeable to any

sovereign, yet Mary’s imprudence had been so great, perhaps her crimes so

enormous, that the insurrection of subjects, after such provocation, could

no longer be regarded as a precedent against other princes: that it was

first necessary for Elizabeth to ascertain, in a regular and satisfactory

manner, the extent of Mary’s guilt, and thence to determine the degree of

protection which she ought to afford her against her discontented

subjects: that as no glory could surpass that of defending oppressed

innocence, it was equally infamous to patronize vice and murder on the

throne; and the contagion of such dishonor would extend itself to all who

countenanced or supported it: and that if the crimes of the Scottish

princess should, on inquiry, appear as great and certain as was affirmed

and believed, every measure against her, which policy should dictate,

would thence be justified; or if she should be found innocent, every

enterprise which friendship should inspire would be acknowledged laudable

and glorious.

 

Agreeably to these views, Elizabeth resolved to proceed in a seemingly

generous, but really cautious manner with the queen of Scots; and she

immediately sent orders to Lady Scrope, sister to the duke of Norfolk, a

lady who lived in the neighborhood, to attend on that princess. Soon

after, she despatched to her Lord Scrope himself, warden of the marches,

and Sir Francis Knolles, vice-chamberlain. They found Mary already lodged

in the Castle of Carlisle; and after expressing the queen’s sympathy with

her in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her request of being

allowed to visit their sovereign, and of being admitted to her presence,

could not at present be complied with: till she had cleared herself of her

husband’s murder, of which she was so strongly accused, Elizabeth could

not without dishonor show her any countenance, or appear indifferent to

the assassination of so near a kinsman.[*]

 

So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears: and the necessity of her

situation extorted from her a declaration, that she would willingly

justify herself to her sister from all imputations, and would submit her

cause to the arbitration of so good a friend.[*] Two days after, she sent

Lord Herreis to London with a letter to the same purpose.

 

This concession, which Mary could scarcely avoid without an acknowledgment

of guilt, was the point expected and desired by Elizabeth: she immediately

despatched Midlemore to the regent of Scotland; requiring him both to

desist from the further prosecution of his queen’s party, and to send some

persons to London to justify his conduct with regard to her. Murray might

justly be startled at receiving a message so violent and imperious; but as

his domestic enemies were numerous and powerful, and England was the sole

ally which he could expect among foreign nations, he was resolved rather

to digest the affront, than provoke Elizabeth by a refusal. He also

considered, that though that queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary,

many political motives evidently engaged her to support the king’s cause

in Scotland; and it was not to be doubted but so penetrating a princess

would in the end discover this interest, and would at least afford him a

patient and equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he would himself

take a journey to England, attended by other commissioners, and would

willingly submit the determination of his cause to Elizabeth.[**]

 

Lord Herreis now perceived that his mistress had advanced too far in her

concessions: he endeavored to maintain, that Mary could not, without

diminution of her royal dignity, submit to a contest with her rebellious

subjects before a foreign prince: and he required either present aid from

England, or liberty for his queen to pass over into France. Being pressed,

however, with the former agreement before the English council, he again

renewed his consent; but in a few days he began anew to recoil; and it was

with some difficulty that he was brought to acquiesce in the first

determination.[***] These fluctuations, which were incessantly renewed,

showed his visible reluctance to the measures pursued by the court of

England.

 

The queen of Scots discovered no less aversion to the trial proposed; and

it required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to make her

persevere in the agreement to which she had at first consented. This

latter princess still said to her, that she desired not without Mary’s

consent and approbation to enter into the question, and pretended only as

a friend to hear her justification: that she was confident there would be

found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of her enemies; and even

if her apology should fall short of full conviction, Elizabeth was

determined to support her cause, and procure her some reasonable terms of

accommodation; and that it was never meant, that she should be cited to a

trial on the accusation of her rebellious subjects; but, on the contrary,

that they should be summoned to appear, and to justify themselves for

their conduct towards her.[*] Allured by these plausible professions, the

queen of Scots agreed to vindicate herself by her own commissioners,

before commissioners appointed by Elizabeth.

 

During these transactions, Lord Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles, who

resided with Mary at Carlisle, had leisure to study her character, and to

make report of it to Elizabeth. Unbroken by her misfortunes, resolute in

her purpose, active in her enterprises, she aspired to nothing but

victory; and was determined to endure any extremity, to undergo any

difficulty, and to try every fortune, rather than abandon her cause, or

yield the superiority to her enemies. Eloquent, insinuating, affable, she

had already convinced all those who approached her, of the innocence of

her past conduct; and as she declared her fixed purpose to require aid of

her friends all over Europe, and even to have recourse to infidels and

barbarians, rather than fail of vengeance against her persecutors, it was

easy to foresee the danger to which her charms, her spirit, her address,

if allowed to operate with their full force, would expose them.[**] The

court of England, therefore, who, under pretence of guarding her, had

already in effect detained her prisoner, were determined to watch her with

still greater vigilance. As Carlisle, by its situation on the borders,

afforded her great opportunities of contriving her escape, they removed

her to Bolton, a seat of Lord Scrope’s in Yorkshire; and the issue of the

controversy between her and the Scottish nation was regarded as a subject

more momentous to Elizabeth’s security and interests than it had hitherto

been apprehended.

 

The Commissioners appointed by the English court for the examination of

this great cause, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Sussex, and Sir

Ralph Sadler; and York was named as the place of conference. Lesley,

bishop of Ross, the lords Herreis, Levingstone, and Boyde, with three

persons more, appeared as commissioners from the queen of Scots. The earl

of Murray, regent, the earl of Morton, the bishop of Orkney, Lord

Lindesey, and the abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commissioners from

the king and kingdom of Scotland. Secretary Lidington, George Buchanan,

the famous poet and historian, with some others, were named as their

assistants.

 

It was a great circumstance in Elizabeth’s glory, that she was thus chosen

umpire between the factions of a neighboring kingdom, which had during

many centuries entertained the most violent jealousy and animosity against

England; and her felicity was equally rare, in having the fortunes and

fame of so dangerous a rival, who had long given her the greatest

inquietude, now entirely at her disposal. Some circumstances of her late

conduct had discovered a bias towards the side of Mary: her prevailing

interests led her to favor the enemies of that princess: the professions

of impartiality which she had made were open and frequent; and she had so

far succeeded, that each side accused her commissioners of partiality

towards their adversaries.[*] She herself appears, by the instructions

given them, to have fixed no plan for the decision; but she knew that the

advantages which she should reap must be great, whatever issue the cause

might take. If Mary’s crimes could be ascertained by undoubted proof, she

could forever blast the reputation of that princess, and might justifiably

detain her forever a prisoner in England: if the evidence fell short of

conviction, it was intended to restore her to the throne, but with such

strict limitations, as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of all

differences between the parties in Scotland, and render her in effect

absolute mistress of the kingdom.[**]

 

Mary’s commissioners, before they gave in their complaint, against her

enemies in Scotland, entered a protest, that their appearance in the cause

should nowise affect the independence of her crown, or be construed as a

mark of subordination to England: the English commissioners received this

protest, but with a reserve to the claim of England. The complaint of that

princess was next read, and contained a detail of the injuries which she

had suffered since her marriage with Bothwell: that her subjects had taken

arms against her, on pretence of freeing her from captivity; that when she

put herself into their hands, they had committed her to close custody in

Lochlevin; had placed her son, an infant, on her throne; had again taken

arms against her after her deliverance from prison; had rejected all her

proposals for accommodation, had given battle to her troops; and had

obliged her, for the safety of her person, to take shelter in England.[*]

The earl of Murray, in answer to this complaint, gave a summary and

imperfect account of the late transactions: that the earl of Bothwell, the

known murderer of the late king, had, a little after committing that

crime, seized the person of the queen and led her to Dunbar; that he

acquired such influence over her as to gain her consent to marry him, and

he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife, and had

pretended to celebrate his nuptials with the queen; that the scandal of

this transaction, the dishonor which it brought on the nation, the danger

to which the infant prince was exposed from the attempts of that audacious

man, had obliged the nobility to take arms, and oppose his criminal

enterprises; that after Mary, in order to save him, had thrown herself

into their hands, she still discovered such a violent attachment to him,

that they found it necessary, for their own and the public safety, to

confine her person during a season, till Bothwell and the other murderers

of her husband could be tried and punished for their crimes; and that

during this confinement she had voluntarily, without compulsion or

violence, merely from disgust at the inquietude and vexations attending

power, resigned her crown to her only son, and had appointed the earl of

Murray regent during the minority.[**]

 

The queen’s answer to this apology was obvious: that she did not know, and

never could suspect, that Bothwell, who had been acquitted by a jury, and

recommended to her by all the nobility for her husband, was the murderer

of the king; that she ever was, and still continues desirous, that, if he

be guilty, he may be brought to condign punishment; that her resignation

of the crown was extorted from her by the well-grounded fears of her life,

and even by direct menaces of violence; and that Throgmorton, the English

ambassador, as well as others of her friends, had advised her to sign that

paper, as the only means of saving herself from the last extremity, and

had assured her, that a consent, given under these circumstances, could

never have any validity.[*]

 

So far the queen of Scots seemed plainly to have the advantage in the

contest; and the English commissioners might have been surprised that

Murray had made so weak a defence, and had suppressed all the material

imputations against that princess, on which his party had ever so

strenuously insisted, had not some private conferences previously informed

them of the secret. Mary’s commissioners had boasted that Elizabeth, from

regard to her kinswoman, and from her desire of maintaining the rights of

sovereigns, was determined, how criminal soever the conduct of that

princess might appear, to restore her to the throne;[**] and Murray,

reflecting on some past measures of the English court, began to apprehend

that there were but too just grounds for these expectations. He believed

that Mary, if he would agree to conceal the most violent part of the

accusation against her, would submit to any reasonable terms of

accommodation; but if he once proceeded so far as to charge her with the

whole of her guilt, no composition could afterwards take place; and should

she ever be restored, either by the power of Elizabeth or the assistance

of her other friends, he and his party must be exposed to her severe and

implacable vengeance.[***] He resolved, therefore, not to venture rashly

on a measure which it would be impossible for him ever to recall; and he

privately paid a visit to Norfolk and the other English commissioners,

confessed his scruples, laid before them the evidence of the queen’s

guilt, and desired to have some security for Elizabeth’s protection, in

case that evidence should, upon examination, appear entirely satisfactory.

Norfolk was not secretly displeased with these scruples of the

regent.[****]

 

He had ever been a partisan of the queen of Scots. Secretary Lidington,

who began also to incline to that party, and was a man of singular address

and capacity, had engaged him to embrace further views in her favor, and

even to think of espousing her: and though that duke confessed[*] that the

proofs against Mary seemed to him unquestionable, he encouraged Murray in

his present resolution, not to produce them publicly in the conferences

before the English commissioners.[**]

 

Norfolk, however, was obliged to transmit to court the queries proposed by

the regent. These queries consisted of four particulars: Whether the

English commissioners had authority from their sovereign to pronounce

sentence against Mary, in case her guilt should be fully proved before

them? Whether they would promise to exercise that authority, and proceed

to an actual sentence? Whether the queen of Scots, if she were found

guilty, should be delivered into the hands of the regent, or, at least, be

so secured in England, that she never should be able to disturb the

tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth would also, in that case,

promise to acknowledge the young king, and protect the regent in his

authority?[***]

 

Elizabeth, when these queries, with the other transactions, were laid

before her, began to think that they pointed towards a conclusion more

decisive and more advantageous than she had hitherto expected. She

determined therefore to bring the matter into full light; and, under

pretext that the distance from her person retarded the proceedings of her

commissioners, she ordered them to come to London, and there continue the

conferences. On their appearance, she immediately joined in commission

with them some of the most considerable of her council; Sir Nicholas

Bacon, lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leicester, Lord Clinton,

admiral, and Sir William Cecil, secretary.[****] The queen of Scots, who

knew nothing of these secret motives, and who expected that fear or

decency would still restrain Murray from proceeding to any violent

accusation against her, expressed an entire satisfaction in this

adjournment; and declared that the affair, being under the immediate

inspection of Elizabeth, was now in the hands where she most desired to

rest it.[v].

 

The conferences were accordingly continued at Hampton Court; and Mary’s

commissioners, as before, made no scruple to be present at them.

 

The queen, meanwhile, gave a satisfactory answer to all Murray’s demands;

and declared that, though she wished and hoped from the present inquiry to

be entirely convinced of Mary’s innocence, yet if the event should prove

contrary, and if that princess should appear guilty of her husband’s

murder, she should, for her own part, deem her ever after unworthy of a

throne.[*] The regent, encouraged by this declaration, opened more fully

his charge against the queen of Scots; and after expressing his reluctance

to proceed to that extremity, and protesting that nothing but the

necessity of self-defence, which must not be abandoned for any delicacy,

could have engaged him in such a measure, he proceeded to accuse her in

plain terms of participation and consent in the assassination of the

king.[**] The earl of Lenox too appeared before the English commissioners,

and, imploring vengeance for the murder of his son, accused Mary as an

accomplice with Bothwell in that enormity.[***]

 

When this charge was so unexpectedly given in, and copies of it were

transmitted to the bishop of Ross, Lord Herreis, and the other

commissioners of Mary, they absolutely refused to return an answer; and

they grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons: they had

orders, they said, from their mistress, if any thing were advanced that

might touch her honor, not to make any defence, as she was a sovereign

princess, and could not be subject to any tribunal; and they required that

she should previously be admitted to Elizabeth’s presence, to whom, and to

whom alone, she was determined to justify her innocence.[****]

 

They forgot that the conferences were at first begun, and were still

continued, with no other view than to clear her from the accusations of

her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever pretended to enter into them only as

her friend, by her own consent and approbation, not as assuming any

jurisdiction over her; that this princess had from the beginning refused

to admit her to her presence, till she should vindicate herself from the

crimes imputed to her; that she had therefore discovered no new signs of

partiality by her perseverance in that resolution; and that though she had

granted an audience to the earl of Murray and his colleagues, she had

previously conferred the same honor on Mary’s commissioners;[*] and her

conduct was so far entirely equal to both parties.[**] 11
 

As the commissioners of the queen of Scots refused to give in any answer

to Murray’s charge, the necessary consequence seemed to be, that there

could be no further proceedings in the conference. But though this silence

might be interpreted as a presumption against her, it did not fully answer

the purpose of those English ministers who were enemies to that princess.

They still desired to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt; and in

order to draw them with decency from the regent, a judicious artifice was

employed by Elizabeth. Murray was called before the English commissioners,

and reproved by them, in the queen’s name, for the atrocious imputations

which he had the temerity to throw upon his sovereign; but though the earl

of Murray, they added, and the other commissioners, had so far forgotten

the duty of allegiance to their prince, the queen never would overlook

what she owed to her friend, her neighbor, and her kinswoman; and she

therefore desired to know what they could say in their own

justification.[***] Murray, thus urged, made no difficulty in producing

the proofs of his charge against the queen of Scots; and among the rest,

some love-letters and sonnets of hers to Bothwell, written all in her own

hand, and two other papers, one written in her own hand, another

subscribed by her, and written by the earl of Huntley; each of which

contained a promise of marriage with Bothwell, made before the pretended

trial and acquittal of that nobleman.

 

All these important papers had been kept by Bothwell in a silver box or

casket, which had been given him by Mary, and which had belonged to her

first husband, Francis; and though the princess had enjoined him to burn

the letters as soon as he had read them, he had thought proper carefully

to preserve them, as pledges of her fidelity, and had committed them to

the custody of Sir James Balfour, deputy governor of the Castle of

Edinburgh. When that fortress was besieged by the associated lords,

Bothwell sent a servant to receive the casket from the hands of the deputy

governor. Balfour delivered it to the messenger; but as he had at that

time received some disgust from Bothwell, and was secretly negotiating an

agreement with the ruling party, he took care, by conveying private

intelligence to the earl of Morton, to make the papers be intercepted by

him, They contained incontestable proofs of Mary’s criminal correspondence

with Bothwell, of her consent to the king’s murder, and of her concurrence

in the violence which Bothwell pretended to commit upon her.[*] Murray

fortified this evidence by some testimonies of corresponding facts;[**]

and he added, some time after, the dying confession of one Hubert, or

French Paris, as he was called, a servant of Bothwell’s, who had been

executed for the king’s murder, and who directly charged the queen with

her being accessory to that criminal enterprise.[***]

 

Mary’s commissioners had used every expedient to ward this blow, which

they saw coming upon them, and against which, it appears, they were not

provided with any proper defence. As soon as Murray opened his charge,

they endeavored to turn the conferences from an inquiry into a

negotiation; and though informed by the English commissioners, that

nothing could be more dishonorable for their mistress, than to enter into

a treaty with such undutiful subjects, before she had justified herself

from those enormous imputations which had been thrown upon her, they still

insisted that Elizabeth should settle terms of accommodation between Mary

and her enemies in Scotland.[****] They maintained, that till their

mistress had given in her answer to Murray’s charge, his proofs could

neither be called for nor produced:[v] and finding that the English

commissioners were still determined to proceed in the method which had

been projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and never would

make any reply.

 

These papers, at least translations of them, have since been published.

The objections made to their authenticity are in general of small force:

but were they ever so specious, they cannot now be hearkened to; since

Mary, at the time when the truth could have been fully cleared, did in

effect ratify the evidence against her, by recoiling from the inquiry at

the very critical moment, and refusing to give an answer to the accusation

of her enemies.[*] 12
 

But Elizabeth, though she had seen enough for her own satisfaction, was

determined that the most eminent persons of her court should also be

acquainted with these transactions, and should be convinced of the equity

of her proceedings. She ordered her privy council to be assembled; and,

that she might render the matter more solemn and authentic, she summoned

along with them the earls of Northumberland, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury,

Worcester, Huntingdon, and Warwick. All the proceedings of the English

commissioners were read to them: the evidences produced by Murray were

perused: a great number of letters written by Mary to Elizabeth were laid

before them, and the handwriting compared with that of the letters

delivered in by the regent: the refusal of the queen of Scots’

commissioners to make any reply was related: and on the whole, Elizabeth

told them, that as she had from the first thought it improper that Mary,

after such horrid crimes were imputed to her, should be admitted to her

presence, before she had in some measure justified herself from the

charge, so now, when her guilt was confirmed by so many evidences, and all

answer refused, she must, for her part, persevere more steadily in that

resolution.[**] Elizabeth next called in the queen of Scots’

commissioners; and after observing, that she deemed it much more decent

for their mistress to continue the conferences, than to require the

liberty of justifying herself in person, she told them, that Mary might

either send her reply by a person whom she trusted, or deliver it herself

to some English nobleman, whom Elizabeth should appoint to wait upon her:

but as to her resolution of making no reply at all, she must regard it as

the strongest confession of guilt, nor could they ever be deemed her

friends who advised her to that method of proceeding.[***] These topics

she enforced still more strongly in a letter which she wrote to Mary

herself.[****]

 

The queen of Scots had no other subterfuge from these pressing

remonstrances, than still to demand a personal interview with Elizabeth: a

concession which, she was sensible, would never be granted;[*] because

Elizabeth knew that this expedient could decide nothing; because it

brought matters to extremity, which that princess desired to avoid; and

because it had been refused from the beginning, even before the

commencement of the conferences. In order to keep herself better in

countenance, Mary thought of another device. Though the conferences were

broken off, she ordered her commissioners to accuse the earl of Murray and

his associates as the murderers of the king:[**] but this accusation,

coming so late, being extorted merely by a complaint of Murray’s, and

being unsupported by any proof, could only be regarded as an angry

recrimination upon her enemy.[***] 13 She also desired to have

copies of the papers given in by the regent; but as she still persisted in

her resolution to make no reply before the English commissioners, this

demand was finally refused her.[****] 14
 

As Mary had thus put an end to the conferences, the regent expressed great

impatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies

had taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government

into confusion. Elizabeth therefore dismissed him; and granted him a loan

of five thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey.[*] During the

conferences at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in passing

from France; and as the queen knew that he was engaged in Mary’s party,

and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the king of Scots,

she thought proper to detain him till after Murray’s departure. But

notwithstanding these marks of favor, and some other assistance which she

secretly gave this latter nobleman,[**] she still declined acknowledging

the young king, or treating with Murray as regent of Scotland.

 

Orders were given for removing the queen of Scots from Bolton, a place

surrounded with Catholics, to Tutbury, in the county of Stafford, where

she was put under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury. Elizabeth

entertained hopes that this princess, discouraged by her misfortunes, and

confounded by the late transactions, would be glad to secure a safe

retreat from all the tempests with which she had been agitated; and she

promised to bury every thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agree,

either voluntary to resign her crown, or to associate her son with her in

the government; and the administration to remain, during his minority, in

the hands of the earl of Murray.[*] But that high-spirited princess

refused all treaty upon such terms, and declared that her last words

should be those of a queen of Scotland. Besides many other reasons, she

said, which fixed her in that resolution, she knew, that if in the present

emergence she made such concessions, her submission would be universally

deemed an acknowledgment of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of

her enemies.[**]

 

Mary still insisted upon this alternative; either that Elizabeth should

assist her in recovering her authority, or should give her liberty to

retire into France, and make trial of the friendship of other princes: and

as she asserted, that she had come voluntarily into England, invited by

many former professions of amity, she thought that one or other of these

requests could not, without the most extreme injustice, be refused her.

But Elizabeth, sensible of the danger which attended both these proposals,

was secretly resolved to detain her still a captive; and as her retreat

into England had been little voluntary, her claim upon the queen’s

generosity appeared much less urgent than she was willing to pretend.

Necessity, it was thought, would to the prudent justify her detention: her

past misconduct would apologize for it to the equitable: and though it was

foreseen, that compassion for Mary’s situation, joined to her intrigues

and insinuating behavior, would, while she remained in England, excite the

zeal of her friends, especially of the Catholics, these inconveniences

were deemed much inferior to those which attended any other expedient.

Elizabeth trusted also to her own address, for eluding all these

difficulties: she purposed to avoid breaking absolutely with the queen of

Scots, to keep her always in hopes of an accommodation, to negotiate

perpetually with her, and still to throw the blame of not coming to any

conclusion, either on unforeseen accidents, or on the obstinacy and

perverseness of others.

 

We come now to mention some English affairs which we left behind us, that

we might not interrupt our narrative of the events in Scotland, which

formed so material a part of the present reign. The term fixed by the

treaty of Chateau-Cambresis for the restitution of Calais, expired in

1567; and Elizabeth, after making her demand at the gates of that city,

sent Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that minister, in conjunction with Sir

Henry Norris, her resident ambassador, enforced her pretensions.

Conferences were held on that head, without coming to any conclusion

satisfactory to the English. The chancellor, De L’Hospital, told the

English ambassadors, that though France by an article of the treaty was

obliged to restore Calais on the expiration of eight years, there was

another article of the same treaty, which now deprived Elizabeth of any

right that could accrue to her by that engagement; that it was agreed, if

the English should, during the interval, commit hostilities upon France,

they should instantly forfeit all claim to Calais; and the taking

possession of Havre and Dieppe, with whatever pretences that measure might

be covered, was a plain violation of the peace between the nations: that

though these places were not entered by force, but put into Elizabeth’s

hands by the governors, these governors were rebels; and a correspondence

with such traitors was the most flagrant injury that could be committed on

any sovereign: that in the treaty which ensued upon the expulsion of the

English from Normandy, the French ministers had absolutely refused to make

any mention of Calais, and had thereby declared their intention to take

advantage of the title which had accrued to the crown of France: and that

though a general clause had been inserted, implying a reservation of all

claims, this concession could not avail the English, who at that time

possessed no just claim to Calais, and had previously forfeited all right

to that fortress.[*] The queen was nowise surprised at hearing these

allegations; and as she knew that the French court intended not from the

first to make restitution, much less after they could justify their

refusal by such plausible reasons, she thought it better for the present

to acquiesce in the loss, than to pursue a doubtful title by a war both

dangerous and expensive, as well as unseasonable.[**]

 

Elizabeth entered anew into negotiations for espousing the archduke

Charles; and she seems, at this time, to have had no great motive of

policy which might induce her to make this fallacious offer: but as she

was very rigorous in the terms insisted on, and would not agree that the

archduke, if he espoused her, should enjoy any power or title in England,

and even refused him the exercise of his religion, the treaty came to

nothing; and that prince, despairing of success in his addresses, married

the daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria.[*]
