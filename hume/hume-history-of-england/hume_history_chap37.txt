THE success which Gardiner, from his cautious and prudent conduct, had met

with in governing the parliament, and engaging them to concur both in the

Spanish match and in the reÃ«stablishment of the ancient religion,—two

points to which, it was believed, they bore an extreme aversion,—had

so raised his character for wisdom and policy that his opinion was

received as an oracle in the council; and his authority, as it was always

great in his own party, no longer suffered any opposition or control.

Cardinal Pole himself, though more beloved on account of his virtue and

candor, and though superior in birth and station, had not equal weight in

public deliberations; and while his learning, piety, and humanity were

extremely respected, he was represented more as a good man than a great

minister. A very important question was frequently debated before the

queen and council by these two ecclesiastics; whether the laws lately

revived against heretics should be put in execution, or should only be

employed to restrain by terror the bold attempts of these zealots. Pole

was very sincere in his religious principles; and though his moderation

had made him be suspected at Rome of a tendency towards Lutheranism, he

was seriously persuaded of the Catholic doctrines, and thought that no

consideration of human policy ought ever to come in competition with such

important interests. Gardiner, on the contrary, had always made his

religion subservient to his schemes of safety or advancement; and by his

unlimited complaisance to Henry, he had shown that, had he not been pushed

to extremity under the late minority, he was sufficiently disposed to make

a sacrifice of his principles to the established theology. This was the

well-known character of these two great counsellors; yet such is the

prevalence of temper above system, that the benevolent disposition of Pole

led him to advise a toleration of the heretical tenets which he highly

blamed; while the severe manners of Gardiner inclined him to support by

persecution that religion which, at the bottom, he regarded with great

indifference.[*] This circumstance of public conduct was of the highest

importance; and from being the object of deliberation in the council, it

soon became the subject of discourse throughout the nation. We shall

relate, in a few words, the topics by which each side supported, or might

have supported, their scheme of policy; and shall display the opposite

reasons which have been employed, with regard to an argument that ever has

been, and ever will be, so much canvassed.

 

The practice of persecution, said the defenders of Pole’s opinion, is the

scandal of all religion; and the theological animosity, so fierce and

violent, far from being an argument of men’s conviction in their opposite

sects, is a certain proof that they have never reached any serious

persuasion with regard to these remote and sublime subjects. Even those

who are the most impatient of contradiction in other controversies, are

mild and moderate in comparison of polemical divines; and wherever a man’s

knowledge and experience give him a perfect assurance in his own opinion,

he regards with contempt, rather than anger, the opposition and mistakes

of others. But while men zealously maintain what they neither clearly

comprehend nor entirely believe, they are shaken in their imagined faith

by the opposite persuasion, or even doubts, of other men; and vent on

their antagonists that impatience which is the natural result of so

disagreeable a state of the understanding. They then easily embrace any

pretense for representing opponents as impious and profane; and if they

can also find a color for connecting this violence with the interests of

civil government, they can no longer be restrained from giving

uncontrolled scope to vengeance and resentment. But surely never

enterprise was more unfortunate than that of founding persecution upon

policy, or endeavoring, for the sake of peace, to settle an entire

uniformity of opinion in questions which, of all others, are least

subjected to the criterion of human reason. The universal and

uncontradicted prevalence of one opinion in religious subjects can be

owing, at first, to the stupid ignorance alone and barbarism of the

people, who never indulge themselves in any speculation or inquiry; and

there is no expedient for maintaining that uniformity so fondly sought

after, but by banishing forever all curiosity, and all improvement in

science and cultivation. It may not indeed appear difficult to check, by a

steady severity, the first beginnings of controversy; but besides that

this policy exposes forever the people to all the abject terrors of

superstition, and the magistrate to the endless encroachments of

ecclesiastics, it also renders men so delicate that they can never endure

to hear of opposition; and they will some time pay dearly for that false

tranquillity in which they have been so long indulged. As healthful bodies

are ruined by too nice a regimen, and are thereby rendered incapable of

bearing the unavoidable incidents of human life, a people who never were

allowed to imagine that their principles could be contested fly out into

the most outrageous violence when any event (and such events are common)

produces a faction among their clergy, and gives rise to any difference in

tenet or opinion. But whatever may be said in favor of suppressing, by

persecution, the first beginnings of heresy, no solid argument can be

alleged for extending severity towards multitudes, or endeavoring, by

capital punishments, to extirpate an opinion which has diffused itself

among men of every rank and station. Besides the extreme barbarity of such

an attempt, it commonly proves ineffectual to the purpose intended, and

serves only to make men more obstinate in their persuasion, and to

increase the number of their proselytes. The melancholy with which the

fear of death, torture, and persecution inspires the sectaries, is the

proper disposition for fostering religious zeal: the prospect of eternal

rewards, when brought near, overpowers the dread of temporal punishments:

the glory of martyrdom stimulates all the more furious zealots, especially

the leaders and preachers: where a violent animosity is excited by

oppression, men naturally pass from hating the persons of their tyrants to

a more violent abhorrence of their doctrines: and the spectators, moved

with pity towards the supposed martyrs, are easily seduced to embrace

those principles which can inspire men with a constancy that appears

almost supernatural. Open the door to toleration, mutual hatred relaxes

among the sectaries, their attachment to their particular modes of

religion decays; the common occupations and pleasures of life succeed to

the acrimony of disputation; and the same man who, in other circumstances,

would have braved flames and tortures, is induced to change his sect from

the smallest prospect of favor and advancement, or even from the frivolous

hope of becoming more fashionable in his principles. If any exception can

be admitted to this maxim of toleration, it will only be where a theology

altogether new, nowise connected with the ancient religion of the state,

is imported from foreign countries, and may easily, at one blow, be

eradicated, without leaving the seeds of future innovation. But as this

exception would imply some apology for the ancient pagan persecutions, or

for the extirpation of Christianity in China and Japan, it ought surely,

on account of this detested consequence, to be rather buried in eternal

silence and oblivion.

 

Though these arguments appear entirely satisfactory, yet such is the

subtlety of human wit, that Gardiner and the other enemies to toleration

were not reduced to silence; and they still found topics on which to

maintain the controversy. The doctrine, said they, of liberty of

conscience, is founded on the most flagrant impiety, and supposes such an

indifference among all religions, such an obscurity in theological

doctrines, as to render the church and magistrate incapable of

distinguishing with certainty the dictates of Heaven from the mere

fictions of human imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to

mankind, he will surely give a criterion by which they may be ascertained;

and a prince who knowingly allows these principles to be perverted or

adulterated, is infinitely more criminal than if he gave permission for

the vending of poison, under the shape of food, to all his subjects.

Persecution may, indeed, seem better calculated to make hypocrites than

converts; but experience teaches us, that the habits of hypocrisy often

turn into reality; and the children, at least, ignorant of the

dissimulation of their parents, may happily be educated in more orthodox

tenets. It is absurd, in opposition to considerations of such unspeakable

importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous interests of civil

society; and if matters be thoroughly examined, even that topic will not

appear so universally certain in favor of toleration as by some it is

represented. Where sects arise whose fundamental principle on all sides is

to execrate, and abhor, and damn, and extirpate each other, what choice

has the magistrate left but to take part, and by rendering one sect

entirely prevalent, restore, at least for a time, the public tranquillity?

The political body, being here sickly, must not be treated as if it were

in a state of sound health; and an affected neutrality in the prince, or

even a cool preference, may serve only to encourage the hopes of all the

sects, and keep alive their animosity. The Protestants, far from

tolerating the religion of their ancestors, regard it as an impious and

detestable idolatry; and during the late minority, when they were entirely

masters, they enacted very severe, though not capital, punishments against

all exercise of the Catholic worship, and even against such as barely

abstained from their profane rites and sacraments. Nor are instances

wanting of their endeavors to secure an imagined orthodoxy by the most

rigorous executions: Calvin has burned Servetus at Geneva; Cranmer brought

Arians and Anabaptists to the stake; and if persecution of any kind be

admitted, the most bloody and violent will surely be allowed the most

justifiable, as the most effectual. Imprisonments, fines, confiscations,

whippings, serve only to irritate the sects, without disabling them from

resistance: but the stake, the wheel, and the gibbet, must soon terminate

in the extirpation or banishment of all the heretics inclined to give

disturbance, and in the entire silence and submission of the rest.

 

The arguments of Gardiner, being more agreeable to the cruel bigotry of

Mary and Philip, were better received; and though Pole pleaded, as is

affirmed,[*] the advice of the emperor, who recommended it to his

daughter-in-law not to exercise violence against the Protestants, and

desired her to consider his own example, who, after endeavoring through

his whole life to extirpate heresy, had in the end reaped nothing but

confusion and disappointment, the scheme of toleration was entirely

rejected. It was determined to let loose the laws in their full vigor

against the reformed religion; and England was soon filled with scenes of

horror, which have ever since rendered the Catholic religion the object of

general detestation and which prove, that no human depravity can equal

revenge and cruelty covered with the mantle of religion.

 

The persecutors began with Rogers, prebendary of St. Paul’s, a man eminent

in his party for virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner’s plan was first

to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, terror would bend to

submission, and whose example, either of punishment or recantation, would

naturally have influence on the multitude: but he found a perseverance and

courage in Rogers, which it may seem strange to find in human nature, and

of which all ages and all sects do nevertheless furnish many examples.

Rogers, beside the care of his own preservation, lay under other powerful

temptations to compliance: he had a wife whom he tenderly loved, and ten

children; yet such was his serenity after his condemnation, that the

jailers, it is said, waked him from a sound sleep when the hour of his

execution approached. He had desired to see his wife before he died; but

Gardiner told him that he was a priest, and could not possibly have a

wife; thus joining insult to cruelty. Rogers was burned in Smithfield.[*]

 

Hooper, bishop of Glocester, had been tried at the same time with Rogers;

but was sent to his own diocese to be executed. This circumstance was

contrived to strike the greater terror into his flock; but it was a source

of consolation to Hooper, who rejoiced in giving testimony, by his death,

to that doctrine which he had formerly preached among them. When he was

tied to the stake, a stool was set before him, and the queen’s pardon laid

upon it, which it was still in his power to merit by a recantation; but he

ordered it to be removed, and cheerfully prepared himself for that

dreadful punishment to which he was sentenced. He suffered it in its full

severity: the wind, which was violent, blew the flame of the reeds from

his body: the fagots were green, and did not kindle easily: all his lower

parts were consumed before his vitals were attacked: one of his hands

dropped off: with the other he continued to beat his breast: he was heard

to pray, and to exhort the people; till his tongue, swollen with the

violence of his agony, could no longer permit him utterance. He was three

quarters of an hour in torture, which he bore with inflexible

constancy.[**]

 

Sanders was burned at Coventry: a pardon was also offered him; but he

rejected it, and embraced the stake, saying, “Welcome the cross of Christ;

welcome everlasting life.” Taylor, parson of Hadley, was punished by fire

in that place, surrounded by his ancient friends and parishioners. When

tied to the stake, he rehearsed a psalm in English: one of his guards

struck him on the mouth, and bade him speak Latin: another, in a rage,

gave him a blow on the head with his halbert, which happily put an end to

his torments.

 

There was one Philpot, archdeacon of Winchester, inflamed with such zeal

for orthodoxy, that having been engaged in dispute with an Arian, he spit

in his adversary’s face, to show the great detestation which he had

entertained against that heresy. He afterwards wrote a treatise to justify

this unmannerly expression of zeal: he said, that he was led to it in

order to relieve the sorrow conceived from such horrid blasphemy, and to

signify how unworthy such a miscreant was of being admitted into the

society of any Christian.[*] Philpot was a Protestant; and falling now

into the hands of people as zealous as himself, but more powerful, he was

condemned to the flames, and suffered at Smithfield. It seems to be almost

a general rule, that in all religions, except the true, no man will suffer

martyrdom who would not also inflict it willingly on all that differ from

him. The same zeal for speculative opinions is the cause of both.

 

The crime for which almost all the Protestants were condemned, was their

refusal to acknowledge the real presence. Gardiner, who had vainly

expected that a few examples would strike a terror into the reformers,

finding the work daily multiply upon him, devolved the invidious office on

others, chiefly on Bonner, a man of profligate manners, and of a brutal

character, who seemed to rejoice in the torments of the unhappy

sufferers.[**] He sometimes whipped the prisoners with his own hands, till

he was tired with the violence of the exercise: he tore out the beard of a

weaver who refused to relinquish his religion; and that he might give him

a specimen of burning, he held his hand to the candle till the sinews and

veins shrunk and burst.[***]

 

It is needless to be particular in enumerating all the cruelties practised

in England during the course of three years that these persecutions

lasted: the savage barbarity on the one hand, and the patient constancy on

the other, are so similar in all those martyrdoms, that the narrative,

little agreeable in itself, would never be relieved by any variety. Human

nature appears not on any occasion so detestable, and at the same time so

absurd, as in these religious persecutions, which sink men below infernal

spirits in wickedness, and below the beasts in folly. A few instances only

may be worth preserving, in order, if possible, to warn zealous bigots

forever to avoid such odious and such fruitless barbarity.

 

Ferrar, bishop of St. David’s, was burned in his own diocese and his

appeal to Cardinal Pole was not attended to.[*] Ridley, bishop of London,

and Latimer, formerly bishop of Worcester, two prelates celebrated for

learning and virtue, perished together in the same flames at Oxford, and

supported each other’s constancy by their mutual exhortations. Latimer,

when tied to the stake, called to his companion, “Be of good cheer,

brother; we shall this day kindle such a torch in England, as, I trust in

God, shall never be extinguished.” The executioners had been so merciful

(for that clemency may more naturally be ascribed to them than to the

religious zealots) as to tie bags of gunpowder about these prelates, in

order to put a speedy period to their tortures: the explosion immediately

killed Latimer, who was in extreme old age; Ridley continued alive during

some time in the midst of the flames.[**]

 

One Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an apprentice, having been seduced by

a priest into a dispute, had unwarily denied the real presence. Sensible

of his danger, he immediately absconded; but Bonner, laying hold of his

father, threatened him with the greatest severities if he did not produce

the young man to stand his trial. Hunter, hearing of the vexations to

which his father was exposed, voluntarily surrendered himself to Bonner,

and was condemned to the flames by that barbarous prelate.

 

Thomas Haukes, when conducted to the stake, agreed with his friends, that,

if he found the torture tolerable, he would make them a signal to that

purpose in the midst of the flames. His zeal for the cause in which he

suffered so supported him that he stretched out his arms, the signal

agreed on; and in that posture he expired.[***] This example, with many

others of like constancy, encouraged multitudes not only to suffer, but

even to court and aspire to martyrdom.

 

The tender sex itself, as they have commonly greater propensity to

religion, produced many examples of the most inflexible courage in

supporting the profession of it against all the fury of the persecutors.

One execution in particular was attended with circumstances which, even at

that time, excited astonishment by reason of their unusual barbarity. A

woman in Guernsey, being near the time of her labor when brought to the

stake, was thrown into such agitation by the torture, that her belly

burst, and she was delivered in the midst of the flames. One of the guards

immediately snatched the infant from the fire, and attempted to save it;

but a magistrate who stood by ordered it to be thrown back: being

determined, he said, that nothing should survive which-sprang from so

obstinate and heretical a parent.[*]

 

The persons condemned to these punishments were not convicted of teaching,

or dogmatizing, contrary to the established religion: they were seized

merely on suspicion; and articles being offered them to subscribe, they

were immediately, upon their refusal, condemned to the flames.[**] These

instances of barbarity, so unusual in the nation, excited horror; the

constancy of the martyrs was the object of admiration; and as men have a

principle of equity engraven in their minds, which even false religion is

not able totally to obliterate, they were shocked to see persons of

probity, of honor, of pious dispositions, exposed to punishments more

severe than were inflicted on the greatest ruffians for crimes subversive

of civil society. To exterminate the whole Protestant party was known to

be impossible; and nothing could appear more iniquitous, than to subject

to torture the most conscientious and courageous among them, and allow the

cowards and hypocrites to escape. Each martyrdom, therefore, was

equivalent to a hundred sermons against Popery; and men either avoided

such horrid spectacles, or returned from them full of a violent, though

secret, indignation against the persecutors. Repeated orders were sent

from the council to quicken the diligence of the magistrates in searching

out heretics; and in some places the gentry were constrained to

countenance by their presence those barbarous executions. These acts of

violence tended only to render the Spanish government daily more odious;

and Philip, sensible of the hatred which he incurred, endeavored to remove

the reproach from himself by a very gross artifice: he ordered his

confessor to deliver, in his presence, a sermon in favor of toleration; a

doctrine somewhat extraordinary in the mouth of a Spanish friar.[***] But

the court, finding that Bonner, however shameless and savage, would not

bear alone the whole infamy, soon threw off the mask; and the unrelenting

temper of the queen, as well as of the king, appeared without control. A

bold step was even taken towards introducing the inquisition into England.

As the bishops’ courts, though extremely arbitrary, and not confined by

any ordinary forms of law, appeared not to be invested with sufficient

power, a commission was appointed, by authority of the queen’s

prerogative, more effectually to extirpate heresy.

 

Twenty-one persons were named; but any three were armed with the powers of

the whole. The commission runs in these terms: “That since many false

rumors were published among the subjects, and many heretical opinions were

also spread among them, the commissioners were to inquire into those,

either by presentments, by witnesses, or any other political way they

could devise, and to search after all heresies; the bringers in, the

sellers, the readers of all heretical books: they were to examine and

punish all misbehaviors or negligences in any church or chapel; and to try

all priests that did not preach the sacrament of the altar; all persons

that did not hear mass, or come to their parish church to service, that

would not go in processions, or did not take holy bread or holy water; and

if they found any that did obstinately persist in such heresies, they were

to put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be punished according

to the spiritual laws; giving the commissioners full power to proceed as

their discretions and consciences should direct them, and to use all such

means as they would invent for the searching of the premises; empowering

them also to call before them such witnesses as they pleased, and to force

them to make oath of such things as might discover what they sought

after.”[*] Some civil powers were also given the commissioners to punish

vagabonds and quarrelsome persons.

 

To bring the methods of proceeding in England still nearer to the practice

of the inquisition, letters were written to Lord North and others,

enjoining them “to put to the torture such obstinate persons as would not

confess, and there to order them at their discretion.”[**]

 

Secret spies, also, and informers were employed, according to the practice

of that iniquitous tribunal. Instructions were given to the justices of

peace—that they should call secretly before them one or two honest

persons within their limits, or more, at their discretion, and command

them by oath, or otherwise, that they shall secretly learn and search out

such persons as shall evil behave themselves in church, or idly, or shall

despise openly by words the king’s or queen’s proceedings, or go about to

make any commotion, or tell any seditious tales or news. And also that the

same persons, so to be appointed, shall declare to the same justices of

peace the ill behavior of lewd disordered persons, whether it shall be for

using unlawful games, and such other light behavior of such suspected

persons; and that the same information shall be given secretly to the

justices; and the same justices shall call such accused persons before

them, and examine them, without declaring by whom they were accused. And

that the same justices shall, upon their examination, punish the offenders

according as their offences shall appear, upon the accusement and

examination, by their discretion, either by open punishment or “by good

abearing.”[*] In some respects this tyrannical edict even exceeded the

oppression of the inquisition, by introducing into every part of

government the same iniquities which that tribunal practises for the

extirpation of heresy only, and which are in some measure necessary,

wherever that end is earnestly pursued.

 

But the court had devised a more expeditious and summary method of

supporting orthodoxy than even the inquisition itself. They issued a

proclamation against books of heresy treason, and sedition, and declared,

“that whosoever had any of these books, and did not presently burn them,

without reading them or showing them to any other person, should be

esteemed rebels, and without any further delay be executed by martial

law.”[**] From the state of the English government during that period, it

is not so much the illegality of these proceedings, as their violence and

their pernicious tendency, which ought to be the object of our censure.

 

We have thrown together almost all the proceedings against heretics,

though carried on during a course of three years, that we may be obliged

as little as possible to return to such shocking violences and

barbarities. It is computed that in that time two hundred and

seventy-seven persons were brought to the stake, besides those who were

punished by imprisonment, fines, and confiscations. Among those who

suffered by fire were five bishops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay

gentlemen, eighty-four tradesmen, one hundred husbandmen, servants, and

laborers, fifty-five women, and four children. This persevering cruelty

appears astonishing; yet is it much inferior to what has been practised in

other countries. A great author[*] computes that, in the Netherlands

alone, from the time that the edict of Charles V. was promulgated against

the reformers, there had been fifty thousand persons hanged, beheaded,

buried alive, or burnt, on account of religion; and that in France the

number had also been considerable. Yet in both countries, as the same

author subjoins, the progress of the new opinions instead of being

checked, was rather forwarded by these persecutions.

 

The burning of heretics was a very natural method of reconciling the

kingdom to the Romish communion; and little solicitation was requisite to

engage the pope to receive the strayed flock, from which he reaped such

considerable profit; yet was there a solemn embassy sent to Rome,

consisting of Sir Anthony Brown, created Viscount Montacute, the bishop of

Ely, and Sir Edward Carne, in order to carry the submissions of England,

and beg to be readmitted into the bosom of the Catholic church.[**] Paul

IV., after a short interval, now filled the papal chair; the most haughty

pontiff that during several ages had been elevated to that dignity. He was

offended that Mary still retained among her titles that of queen of

Ireland; and he affirmed that it belonged to him alone, as he saw cause,

either to erect new kingdoms or abolish the old; but to avoid all dispute

with the new converts, he thought proper to erect Ireland into a kingdom,

and he then admitted the title, as if it had been assumed from his

concession. This was a usual artifice of the popes, to give allowance to

what they could not prevent,[***] and afterwards pretend that princes,

while they exercised their own powers, were only acting by authority from

the papacy. And though Paul had at first intended to oblige Mary formally

to recede from this title before he would bestow it upon her, he found it

prudent to proceed in a less haughty manner.[****]

 

Another point in discussion between the pope and the English ambassadors

was not so easily terminated. Paul insisted that the property and

possessions of the church should be restored to the uttermost farthing;

that whatever belonged to God could never, by any law, be converted to

profane uses; and every person who detained such possessions was in a

state of eternal damnation; that he would willingly, in consideration of

the humble submissions of the English, make them a present of these

ecclesiastical revenues; but such a concession exceeded his power, and the

people might be certain that so great a profanation of holy things would

be a perpetual anathema upon them, and would blast all their future

felicity; that if they would truly show their filial piety, they must

restore all the privileges and emoluments of the Romish church, and

Peter’s pence among the rest; nor could they expect that this apostle

would open to them the gates of paradise, while they detained from him his

patrimony on earth.[*] These earnest remonstrances being transmitted to

England, though they had little influence on the nation, operated

powerfully on the queen, who was determined, in order to ease her

conscience, to restore all the church lands which were still in the

possession of the crown; and the more to display her zeal, she erected

anew some convents and monasteries, notwithstanding the low condition of

the exchequer.[**] When this measure was debated in council, some members

objected, that if such a considerable part of the revenue were

dismembered, the dignity of the crown would fall to decay; but the queen

replied, that she preferred the salvation of her soul to ten such kingdoms

as England.[***] These imprudent measures would not probably have taken

place so easily, had it not been for the death of Gardiner, which happened

about this time; the great seal was given to Heathe, archbishop of York,

that an ecclesiastic might still be possessed of that high office, and be

better enabled by his authority to forward the persecutions against the

reformed.

 

These persecutions were now become extremely odious to the nation; and the

effects of the public discontent appeared in the new parliament, summoned

to meet at Westminster.[****] A bill[v] was passed restoring to the church

the tenths and first-fruits, and all the impropriations which remained in

the hands of the crown; but though this matter directly concerned none but

the queen herself, great opposition was made to the bill in the house of

commons.

 

An application being made for a subsidy during two years, and for two

fifteenths, the latter was refused by the commons; and many members said,

that while the crown was thus despoiling itself of its revenue, it was in

vain to bestow riches upon it. The parliament rejected a bill for obliging

the exiles to return under certain penalties, and another for

incapacitating such as were remiss in the prosecution of heresy from being

justices of peace. The queen, finding the intractable humor of the

commons, thought proper to dissolve the parliament.

 

The spirit of opposition which began to prevail in parliament was the more

likely to be vexatious to Mary, as she was otherwise in very bad humor on

account of her husband’s absence, who, tired of her importunate love and

jealousy, and finding his authority extremely limited in England, had laid

hold of the first opportunity to leave her, and had gone over last summer

to the emperor in Flanders. The indifference and neglect of Philip, added

to the disappointment in her imagined pregnancy, threw her into deep

melancholy; and she gave vent to her spleen by daily enforcing the

persecutions against the Protestants, and even by expressions of rage

against all her subjects; by whom she knew herself to be hated, and whose

opposition, in refusing an entire compliance with Philip was the cause,

she believed, why he had alienated his affections from her, and afforded

her so little of his company.[*]

 

The less return her love met with, the more it increased; and she passed

most of her time in solitude, where she gave vent to her passion, either

in tears, or in writing fond epistles to Philip, who seldom returned her

any answer, and scarcely deigned to pretend any sentiment of love or even

of gratitude towards her. The chief part of government to which she

attended, was the extorting of money from her people, in order to satisfy

his demands; and as the parliament had granted her but a scanty supply,

she had recourse to expedients very violent and irregular. She levied a

loan of sixty thousand pounds upon a thousand persons, of whose

compliance, either on account of their riches or their affections to her,

she held herself best assured: but that sum not sufficing, she exacted a

general loan on every one who possessed twenty pounds a year. This

imposition lay heavy on the gentry, who were obliged, many of them, to

retrench their expenses and dismiss their servants, in order to enable

them to comply with her demands: and as these servants, accustomed to

idleness, and having no means of subsistence, commonly betook themselves

to theft and robbery, the queen published a proclamation, by which she

obliged their former masters to take them back to their service. She

levied sixty thousand marks on seven thousand yeomen who had not

contributed to the former loan; and she exacted thirty-six thousand pounds

more from the merchants. In order to engage some Londoners to comply more

willingly with her multiplied extortions, she passed an edict prohibiting

for four months the exporting of any English cloths or kerseys to the

Netherlands; an expedient which procured a good market for such as had

already sent any quantity of cloth thither. Her rapaciousness engaged her

to give endless disturbance and interruption to commerce. The English

company settled in Antwerp having refused her a loan of forty thousand

pounds, she dissembled her resentment till she found that they had bought

and shipped great quantities of cloth for Antwerp fair, which was

approaching: she then laid an embargo on the ships, and obliged the

merchants to grant her a loan of the forty thousand pounds at first

demanded, to engage for the payment of twenty thousand pounds more at a

limited time, and to submit to an arbitrary imposition of twenty shillings

on each piece. Some time after, she was informed that the Italian

merchants had shipped above forty thousand pieces of cloth for the Levant,

for which they were to pay her a crown a piece, the usual imposition: she

struck a bargain with the merchant adventurers in London; prohibited the

foreigners from making any exportation; and received from the English

merchants, in consideration of this iniquity, the sum of fifty thousand

pounds, and an imposition of four crowns on each piece of cloth which they

should export. She attempted to borrow great sums abroad; but her credit

was so low, that though she offered fourteen per cent to the city of

Antwerp for a loan of thirty thousand pounds, she could not obtain it till

she compelled the city of London to be surety for her.[*] All these

violent expedients were employed while she herself was in profound peace

with all the world, and had visibly no occasion for money but to supply

the demands of a husband who gave attention only to his own convenience,

and showed himself entirely indifferent about her interests.

 

Philip was now become master of all the wealth of the new world, and of

the richest and most extensive dominions in Europe, by the voluntary

resignation of the emperor Charles V.; who, though still in the vigor of

his age, had taken a disgust to the world, and was determined to seek, in

the tranquillity of retreat, for that happiness which he had in vain

pursued amidst the tumults of war and the restless projects of ambition.

He summoned the states of the Low Countries and seating himself on the

throne for the last time, explained to his subjects the reasons of his

resignation, absolved them from all oaths of allegiance, and, devolving

his authority on Philip, told him, that his paternal tenderness made him

weep when he reflected on the burden which he imposed upon him.[*] He

inculcated on him the great and only duty of a prince, the study of his

people’s happiness; and represented how much preferable it was to govern

by affection, rather than by fear, the nations subjected to his dominion.

The cool reflections of age now discovered to him the emptiness of his

former pursuits; and he found that the vain schemes of extending his

empire had been the source of endless opposition and disappointment, and

kept himself, his neighbors, and his subjects, in perpetual inquietude,

and had frustrated the sole end of government, the felicity of the nations

committed to his care; an object which meets with less opposition, and

which, if steadily pursued, can alone convey a lasting and solid

satisfaction.

 

1556.

 

A few months after, he resigned to Philip his other dominions; and

embarking on board a fleet, sailed to Spain, and took his journey to St.

Just, a monastery in Estremadura, which, being situated in a happy

climate, and amidst the greatest beauties of nature, he had chosen for the

place of his retreat. When he arrived at Burgos, he found, by the thinness

of his court, and the negligent attendance of the Spanish grandees, that

he was no longer emperor; and though this observation might convince him

still more of the vanity of the world, and make him more heartily despise

what he had renounced, he sighed to find that all former adulation and

obeisance had been paid to his fortune, not to his person. With better

reason was he struck with the ingratitude of his son Philip, who obliged

him to wait a long time for the payment of the small pension which he had

reserved, and this disappointment in his domestic enjoyments gave him a

sensible concern. He pursued, however, his resolution with inflexible

constancy; and shutting himself up in his retreat, he exerted such

self-command, that he restrained even his curiosity from any inquiry

concerning the transactions of the world which he had entirely abandoned.

The fencing against the pains and infirmities under which he labored

occupied a great part of his time; and during the intervals he employed

his leisure, either in examining the controversies of theology, with which

his age had been so much agitated, and which he had hitherto considered

only in a political light, or in imitating the works of renowned artists,

particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been a great admirer and

encourager. He is said to have here discovered a propensity to the new

doctrines, and to have frequently dropped hints of this unexpected

alteration in his sentiments. Having amused himself with the construction

of clocks and watches, he thence remarked, how impracticable the object

was in which he had so much employed himself during his grandeur; and how

impossible that he, who never could frame two machines that would go

exactly alike, could ever be able to make all mankind concur in the same

belief and opinion. He survived his retreat two years.

 

The emperor Charles had very early in the beginning of his reign found the

difficulty of governing such distant dominions; and he had made his

brother Ferdinand be elected king of the Romans, with a view to his

inheriting the imperial dignity, as well as his German dominions. But

having afterwards enlarged his schemes, and formed plans of aggrandizing

his family, he regretted that he must dismember such considerable states

and he endeavored to engage Ferdinand, by the most tempting offers, and

most earnest solicitations, to yield up his pretensions in favor of

Philip. Finding his attempts fruitless, he had resigned the imperial crown

with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to common form, applied

to the pope for his coronation. The arrogant pontiff refused the demand;

and pretended that, though on the death of an emperor he was obliged to

crown the prince elected, yet, in the case of a resignation, the right

devolved to the holy see, and it belonged to the pope alone to appoint an

emperor. The conduct of Paul was in every thing conformable to these lofty

pretensions. He thundered always in the ears of all ambassadors, that he

stood in no need of the assistance of any prince; that he was above all

potentates on the earth; that he would not accustom monarchs to pretend to

a familiarity or equality with him; that it belonged to him to alter and

regulate kingdoms; that he was successor of those who had deposed kings

and emperors; and that, rather than submit to anything below his dignity,

he would set fire to the four corners of the world. He went so far as, at

table, in the presence of many persons, and even openly, in a public

consistory, to say, that he would not admit any kings for his companions;

they were all his subjects, and he would hold them under these feet: so

saying, he stamped on the ground with his old and infirm limbs: for he was

now past fourscore years of age.[*]

 

The world could not forbear making a comparison between Charles V., a

prince who, though educated amidst wars and intrigues of state, had

prevented the decline of age, and had descended from the throne, in order

to set apart an interval for thought and reflection; and a priest who, in

the extremity of old age, exulted in his dominion, and from restless

ambition and revenge was throwing all nations into combustion. Paul had

entertained the most inveterate animosity against the house of Austria;

and though a truce of five years had been concluded between France and

Spain, he excited Henry by his solicitations to break it, and promised to

assist him in recovering Naples, and the dominions to which he laid claim

in Italy; a project which had ever proved hurtful to the predecessors of

that monarch. He himself engaged in hostilities with the duke of Alva,

viceroy of Naples; and Guise being sent with forces to support him, the

renewal of war between the two crowns seemed almost inevitable. Philip,

though less warlike than his father, was no less ambitious; and he trusted

that, by the intrigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his caution,

and secrecy, and prudence gave him the superiority, he should be able to

subdue all his enemies, and extend his authority and dominion. For this

reason, as well as from the desire of settling his new empire, he wished

to maintain peace with France; but when he found that, without sacrificing

his honor, it was impossible for him to overlook the hostile attempts of

Henry, he prepared for war with great industry. In order to give himself

the more advantage, he was desirous of embarking England in the quarrel;

and though the queen was of herself extremely averse to that measure, he

hoped that the devoted fondness which, notwithstanding repeated instances

of his indifference, she still bore to him, would effectually second his

applications. Had the matter indeed depended solely on her, she was

incapable of resisting her husband’s commands; but she had little weight

with her council, still less with her people; and her government, which

was every day becoming more odious, seemed unable to maintain itself, even

during the most profound tranquillity, much more if a war were kindled

with France, and, what seemed an inevitable consequence, with Scotland,

supported by that powerful kingdom.

 

An act of barbarity was this year exercised in England, which, added to

many other instances of the same kind, tended to render the government

extremely unpopular. Cranmer had long been detained prisoner; but the

queen now determined to bring him to punishment; and in order the more

fully to satiate her vengeance, she resolved to punish him for heresy,

rather than for treason. He was cited by the pope to stand his trial at

Rome; and though he was known to be kept in close custody at Oxford, he

was, upon his not appearing, condemned as contumacious. Bonner, bishop of

London, and Thirleby of Ely, were sent to degrade him; and the former

executed the melancholy ceremony with all the joy and exultation which

suited his savage nature.[*] The implacable spirit of the queen, not

satisfied with the eternal damnation of Cranmer, which she believed

inevitable, and with the execution of that dreadful sentence to which he

was condemned, prompted her also to seek the ruin of his honor and the

infamy of his name. Persons were employed to attack him, not in the way of

disputation, against which he was sufficiently armed, but by flattery,

insinuation, and address, by representing the dignities to which his

character still entitled him, if he would merit them by a recantation; by

giving hopes of long enjoying those powerful friends, whom his beneficent

disposition had attached to him during the course of his prosperity.[*]

 

Overcome by the fond love of life, terrified by the prospect of those

tortures which awaited him, he allowed, in an unguarded hour, the

sentiments of nature to prevail over his resolution, and he agreed to

subscribe the doctrines of the papal supremacy and of the real presence.

The court, equally perfidious and cruel, were determined that this

recantation should avail him nothing; and they sent orders that he should

be required to acknowledge his errors in church before the whole people,

and that he should thence be immediately carried to execution. Cranmer,

whether that he had received a secret intimation of their design, or had

repented of his weakness, surprised the audience by a contrary

declaration. He said, that he was well apprised of the obedience which he

owed to his sovereign and the laws; but this duly extended no further than

to submit patiently to their commands, and to bear without resistance

whatever hardships they should impose upon him: that a superior duty, the

duty which he owed to his Maker, obliged him to speak truth on all

occasions, and not to relinquish, by a base denial, the holy doctrine

which the Supreme Being had revealed to mankind: that there was one

miscarriage in his life, of which, above all others, he severely repented;

the insincere declaration of faith, to which he had the weakness to

consent, and which the fear of death alone had extorted from him: that he

took this opportunity of atoning for his error, by a sincere and open

recantation; and was willing to seal with his blood that doctrine which he

firmly believed to be communicated from Heaven; and that as his hand had

erred by betraying his heart, it should first be punished by a severe but

just doom, and should first pay the forfeit of its offences. He was thence

led to the stake amidst the insults of the Catholics; and having now

summoned up all the force of his mind, he bore their scorn, as well as the

torture of his punishment, with singular fortitude. He stretched out his

hand, and without betraying, either by his countenance or motions, the

least sign of weakness, or even of feeling, he held it in the flames till

it was entirely consumed. His thoughts seemed wholly occupied with

reflections on his former fault; and he called aloud several times, “This

hand has offended.” Satisfied with that atonement, he then discovered a

serenity in his countenance, and when the fire attacked his body, he

seemed to be quite insensible of his outward sufferings, and by the force

of hope and resolution to have collected his mind altogether within

itself, and to repel the fury of the flames. It is pretended, that after

his body was consumed, his heart was found entire and untouched amidst the

ashes; an event which, as it was the emblem of his constancy, was fondly

believed by the zealous Protestants.

 

He was undoubtedly a man of merit; possessed of learning and capacity, and

adorned with candor, sincerity, and beneficence, and all those virtues

which were fitted to render him useful and amiable in society. His moral

qualities procured him universal respect; and the courage of his

martyrdom, though he fell short of the rigid inflexibility observed in

many, made him the hero of the Protestant party.[*]

 

After Cranmer’s death, Cardinal Pole, who had now taken priest’s orders,

was installed in the see of Canterbury; and was thus, by this office, as

well as by his commission of legate, placed at the head of the church of

England. But though he was averse to all sanguinary methods of converting

heretics, and deemed the reformation of the clergy the more effectual, as

the more laudable expedient for that purpose,[**] he found his authority

too weak to oppose the barbarous and bigoted disposition of the queen and

of her counsellors. He himself, he knew, had been suspected of

Lutheranism; and as Paul, the reigning pope, was a furious persecutor, and

his personal enemy, he was prompted, by the modesty of his disposition, to

reserve his credit for other occasions, in which he had a greater

probability of success.[***]

 

1557.

 

The great object of the queen was to engage the nation in the war which

was kindled between France and Spain; and Cardinal Pole, with many other

counsellors, openly and zealously opposed this measure. Besides insisting

on the marriage articles, which provided against such an attempt, they

represented the violence of the domestic factions in England, and the

disordered state of the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of

all these measures was to reduce the kingdom to a total dependence on

Spanish counsels. Philip had come to London, in order to support his

partisans; and he told the queen that, if he were not gratified in so

reasonable a request, he never more would set foot in England. This

declaration extremely heightened her zeal for promoting his interests, and

overcoming the inflexibility of her council. After employing other menaces

of a more violent nature, she threatened to dismiss all of them, and to

appoint counsellors more obsequious; yet could she not procure a vote for

declaring war with France. At length, one Stafford, and some other

conspirators, were detected in a design of surprising Scarborough;[*] and

a confession being extorted from them, that they had been encouraged by

Henry in the attempt, the queen’s importunity prevailed; and it was

determined to make this act of hostility, with others of a like secret and

doubtful nature, the ground of the quarrel. War was accordingly declared

against France; and preparations were every where made for attacking that

kingdom.

 

The revenue of England at that time little exceeded three hundred thousand

pounds.[**] Any considerable supplies could scarcely be expected from

parliament, considering the present disposition of the nation; and as the

war would sensibly diminish that branch arising from the customs, the

finances, it was foreseen, would fall short even of the ordinary charges

of government, and must still more prove unequal to the expenses of war.

But though the queen owed great arrears to all her servants, besides the

loans extorted from her subjects, these considerations had no influence

with her; and in order to support her warlike preparations, she continued

to levy money in the same arbitrary and violent manner which she had

formerly practised. She obliged the city of London to supply her with

sixty thousand pounds on her husband’s entry; she levied before the legal

time the second year’s subsidy voted by parliament; she issued anew many

privy seals, by which she procured loans from her people; and having

equipped a fleet, which she could not victual by reason of the dearness of

provisions, she seized all the corn she could find in Suffolk and Norfolk,

without paying any price to the owners. By all these expedients, assisted

by the power of pressing, she levied an army of ten thousand men, which

she sent over to the Low Countries, under the command of the earl of

Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order to prevent any disturbance at home, many of

the most considerable gentry were thrown into the Tower; and lest they

should be known, the Spanish practice was followed: they either were

carried thither in the night-time, or were hoodwinked and muffled by the

guards who conducted them.[***]

 

The king of Spain had assembled an army, which, after the junction of the

English, amounted to above sixty thousand men, conducted by Philibert,

duke of Savoy, one of the greatest captains of the age. The constable

Montmorency, who commanded the French army, had not half the number to

oppose to him. The duke of Savoy, after menacing Mariembourgh and Rocroy,

suddenly sat down before St. Quintin: and as the place was weak, and ill

provided with a garrison, he expected in a few days to become master of

it. But Admiral Coligny, governor of the province, thinking his honor

interested to save so important a fortress, threw himself into St.

Quintin, with some troops of French and Scottish gensdarmery; and by his

exhortations and example animated the soldiers to a vigorous defence. He

despatched a messenger to his uncle Montmorency, desiring a supply of men;

and the constable approached the place with his whole army, in order to

facilitate the entry of these succors. But the duke of Savoy, falling on

the reÃ«nforcement, did such execution upon them, that not above five

hundred got into the place. He next made an attack on the French army, and

put them to total rout, killing four thousand men, and dispersing the

remainder. In this unfortunate action many of the chief nobility of France

were either slain or taken prisoners: among the latter was the old

constable himself, who, fighting valiantly, and resolute to die rather

than survive his defeat, was surrounded by the enemy, and thus fell alive

into their hands. The whole kingdom of France was thrown into

consternation: Paris was attempted to be fortified in a hurry: and had the

Spaniards presently marched thither, it could not have failed to fall into

their hands. But Philip was of a cautious temper; and he determined first

to take St. Quintin, in order to secure a communication with his own

dominions. A very little time, it was expected, would finish this

enterprise; but the bravery of Coligny still prolonged the siege seventeen

days, which proved the safety of France. Some troops were levied and

assembled. Couriers were sent to recall the duke of Guise and his army

from Italy: and the French, having recovered from their first panic, put

themselves in a posture of defence. Philip, after taking Ham and Catelet,

found the season so far advanced, that he could attempt no other

enterprise: he broke up his camp, and retired to winter quarters.

 

But the vigilant activity of Guise, not satisfied with securing the

frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of winter, to plan an enterprise

which France, during her greatest successes, had always regarded as

impracticable, and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was in that

age deemed an impregnable fortress; and as it was known to be the favorite

of the English nation, by whom it could easily be succored, the recovery

of that place by France was considered as totally desperate. But Coligny

had remarked, that as the town of Calais was surrounded with marshes,

which during the winter were impassable, except over a dike guarded by two

castles, St. Agatha and Newnam Bridge, the English were of late

accustomed, on account of the lowness of their finances, to dismiss a

great part of the garrison at the end of autumn, and to recall them in the

spring, at which time alone they judged their attendance necessary. On

this circumstance he had founded the design of making a sudden attack on

Calais; he had caused the place to be secretly viewed by some engineers;

and a plan of the whole enterprise being found among his papers, it

served, though he himself was made prisoner on the taking of St. Quintin,

to suggest the project of that undertaking, and to direct the measures of

the duke of Guise.

 

Several bodies of troops defiled towards the frontiers on various

pretences; and the whole, being suddenly assembled, formed an army, with

which Guise made an unexpected march towards Calais. At the same time, a

great number of French ships, being ordered into the Channel, under color

of cruising on the English, composed a fleet which made an attack by sea

on the fortifications. The French assaulted St. Agatha with three thousand

arquebusiers; and the garrison, though they made a vigorous defence, were

soon obliged to abandon the place, and retreat to Newnam Bridge. The siege

of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at the same time the

fleet battered the risbank, which guarded the entrance of the harbor; and

both these castles seemed exposed to imminent danger. The governor, Lord

Wentworth, was a brave officer; but finding that the greater part of his

weak garrison was enclosed in the castle of Newnam Bridge and the risbank,

he ordered them to capitulate, and to join him in Calais, which, without

their assistance, he was utterly unable to defend. The garrison of Newnam

Bridge was so happy as to effect this purpose; but that of the risbank

could not obtain such favorable conditions, and were obliged to surrender

at discretion.

 

1558.

 

The duke of Guise, now holding Calais blockaded by sea and land, thought

himself secure of succeeding in his enterprise; but in order to prevent

all accident, be delayed not a moment the attack of the place. He planted

his batteries against the castle, where he made a large breach; and having

ordered Andelot, Coligny’s brother, to drain the fossÃ©e, he commanded an

assault, which succeeded; and the French made a lodgement in the castle.

On the night following, Wentworth attempted to recover this post; but

having lost two hundred men in a furious attack which he made upon it,[*]

he found his garrison so weak, that he was obliged to capitulate. Ham and

Guisnes fell soon after; and thus the duke of Guise, in eight days, during

the depth of winter, made himself master of this strong fortress, that had

cost Edward III. a siege of eleven months, at the head of a numerous army,

which had that very year been victorious in the battle of Crecy. The

English had held it above two hundred years; and as it gave them an easy

entrance into France, it was regarded as the most important possession

belonging to the crown. The joy of the French was extreme, as well as the

glory acquired by Guise; who, at the time when all Europe imagined France

to be sunk by the unfortunate battle of St. Quintin, had, in opposition to

the English, and their allies the Spaniards, acquired possession of a

place which no former king of France, even during the distractions of the

civil wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, had ever ventured to

attempt. The English, on the other hand, bereaved of this valuable

fortress, murmured loudly against the improvidence of the queen and her

council; who, after engaging in a fruitless war for the sake of foreign

interests, had thus exposed the nation to so severe a disgrace. A treasury

exhausted by expenses, and burdened with debts; a people divided and

dejected; a sovereign negligent of her people’s welfare; were

circumstances which, notwithstanding the fair offers and promises of

Philip, gave them small hopes of recovering Calais. And as the Scots,

instigated by French counsels, began to move on the borders, they were now

necessitated rather to look to their defence at home, than to think of

foreign conquests.

 

After the peace which, in consequence of King Edward’s treaty with Henry,

took place between Scotland and England, the queen dowager, on pretence of

visiting her daughter and her relations, made a journey to France; and she

carried along with her the earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Marischal, and

many of the principal nobility. Her secret design was, to take measures

for engaging the earl of Arran to resign to her the government of the

kingdom; and as her brothers, the duke of Guise, the cardinal of Lorraine,

and the duke of Aumale, had uncontrolled influence in the court of France,

she easily persuaded Henry, and by his authority the Scottish nobles, to

enter into her measures. Having also gained Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter,

bishop of Ross, and Gavin Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning, three

creatures of the governor’s, she persuaded him, by their means, to consent

to this resignation;[*] and when every thing was thus prepared for her

purpose, she took a journey to Scotland, and passed through England in her

way thither. Edward received her with great respect and civility; though

he could not forbear attempting to renew the old treaty for his marriage

with her daughter; a marriage, he said, so happily calculated for the

tranquillity, interest, and security of both kingdoms, and the only means

of insuring a durable peace between them. For his part, he added, he never

could entertain a cordial amity for any other husband whom she should

choose; nor was it easy for him to forgive a man who, at the same time

that he disappointed so natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a bride

to whom his affections, from his earliest infancy, had been entirely

engaged. The queen dowager eluded these applications, by telling him, that

if any measures had been taken disagreeable to him, they were entirely

owing to the imprudence of the duke of Somerset, who, instead of employing

courtesy, caresses, and gentle offices, the proper means of gaining a

young princess, had had recourse to arms and violence, and had constrained

the Scottish nobility to send their sovereign into France, in order to

interest that kingdom in protecting their liberty and independence.[**]

 

When the queen dowager arrived in Scotland, she found the governor very

unwilling to fulfil his engagements; and it was not till after many delays

that he could be persuaded to resign his authority. But finding that the

majority of the young princess was approaching, and that the queen dowager

had gained the affections of all the principal nobility, he thought it

more prudent to submit; and having stipulated that he should be declared

next heir to the crown, and should be freed from giving any account of his

past administration, he placed her in possession of the power, and she

thenceforth assumed the name of regent.[*] It was a usual saying of this

princess, that, provided she could render her friends happy, and could

insure to herself a good reputation, she was entirely indifferent what

befell her; and though this sentiment is greatly censured by the zealous

reformers,[**] as being founded wholly on secular motives, it discovers a

mind well calculated for the government of kingdoms. D’Oisel, a Frenchman,

celebrated for capacity, had attended her as ambassador from Henry, but in

reality to assist her with his counsels in so delicate an undertaking as

the administration of Scotland; and this man had formed a scheme for

laying a general tax on the kingdom, in order to support a standing

military force, which might at once repel the inroads of foreign enemies,

and check the turbulence of the Scottish nobles. But though some of the

courtiers were gained over to this project, it gave great and general

discontent to the nation; and the queen regent, after ingenuously

confessing that it would prove pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence

to desist from it, and to trust entirely for her security to the good will

and affections of her subjects.[***]

 

This laudable purpose seemed to be the chief object of her administration;

yet was she sometimes drawn from it by her connections with France, and by

the influence which her brothers had acquired over her. When Mary

commenced hostilities against that kingdom, Henry required the queen

regent to take part in the quarrel; and she summoned a convention of

states at Newbottle, and requested them to concur in a declaration of war

against England. The Scottish nobles, who were become as jealous of French

as the English were of Spanish influence, refused their assent; and the

queen was obliged to have recourse to stratagem in order to effect her

purpose. She ordered D’Oisel to begin some fortifications at Eyemouth, a

place which had been dismantled by the last treaty with Edward; and when

the garrison of Berwick, as she foresaw, made an inroad to prevent the

undertaking, she effectually employed this pretence to inflame the

Scottish nation, and to engage them in hostilities against England.[****]

 

The enterprises however, of the Scots proceeded no farther than some

inroads on the borders: when D’Oisel of himself conducted artillery and

troops to besiege the Castle of Werke, he was recalled, and sharply

rebuked by the council.[*]

 

In order to connect Scotland more closely with France, and to increase the

influence of the latter kingdom, it was thought proper by Henry to

celebrate the marriage between the young queen and the dauphin; and a

deputation was sent by the Scottish parliament to assist at the ceremony,

and to settle the terms of the contract.

 

The close alliance between France and Scotland threatened very nearly the

repose and security of Mary; and it was foreseen, that though the factions

and disorders which might naturally be expected in the Scottish government

during the absence of the sovereign, would make its power less formidable,

that kingdom would at least afford to the French a means of invading

England. The queen, therefore, found it necessary to summon a parliament,

and to demand of them some supplies to her exhausted exchequer. As such an

emergency usually gives great advantage to the people; and as the

parliaments during this reign had shown that, where the liberty and

independency of the kingdom were menaced with imminent danger, they were

not entirely overawed by the court; we shall naturally expect that the

late arbitrary methods of extorting money should at least be censured, and

perhaps some remedy be for the future provided against them. The commons,

however, without making any reflections on the past, voted, besides a

fifteenth, a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land, and two

shillings and eightpence on goods. The clergy granted eight shillings in

the pound, payable, as was also the subsidy of the laity, in four years by

equal portions.

 

The parliament also passed an act, confirming all the sales and grants of

crown lands, which either were already made by the queen, or should be

made during the seven ensuing years. It was easy to foresee that, in

Mary’s present disposition and situation, this power would be followed by

a great alienation of the royal demesnes; and nothing could be more

contrary to the principles of good government, than to establish a prince

with very extensive authority, yet permit him to be reduced to beggary.

This act met with opposition in the house of commons. One Copely expressed

his fears lest the queen, under color of the power there granted, might

alter the succession, and alienate the crown from the lawful heir; but his

words were thought “irreverent” to her majesty: he was committed to the

custody of the serjeant at arms, and though he expressed sorrow for his

offence, he was not released till the queen was applied to for his pardon.

 

The English nation, during this whole reign, were under great

apprehensions with regard not only to the succession, but the life of the

lady Elizabeth. The violent hatred which the queen bore to her broke out

on every occasion; and it required all the authority of Philip, as well as

her own great prudence, to prevent the fatal effects of it. The princess

retired into the country, and knowing that she was surrounded with spies,

she passed her time wholly in reading and study, intermeddled in no

business, and saw very little company. While she remained in this

situation, which for the present was melancholy, but which prepared her

mind for those great actions by which her life was afterwards so much

distinguished, proposals of marriage were made to her by the Swedish

Ambassador, in his master’s name. As her first question was, whether the

queen had been informed of these proposals, the ambassador told her, that

his master thought, as he was a gentleman, it was his duty first to make

his addresses to herself, and having obtained her consent, he would next,

as a king, apply to her sister. But the princess would allow him to

proceed no further; and the queen, after thanking her for this instance of

duty, desired to know how she stood affected to the Swedish proposals.

Elizabeth, though exposed to many present dangers and mortifications, had

the magnanimity to reserve herself for better fortune; and she covered her

refusal with professions of a passionate attachment to a single life,

which, she said, she infinitely preferred before any other.[*] The

princess showed like prudence in concealing her sentiments of religion, in

complying with the present modes of worship, and in eluding all questions

with regard to that delicate subject.[**]

 

The money granted by parliament enabled the queen to fit out a fleet of a

hundred and forty sail, which, being joined by thirty Flemish ships, and

carrying six thousand land forces on board, was sent to make an attempt on

the coast of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by Lord Clinton; the land

forces by the earls of Huntingdon and Rutland. But the equipment of the

fleet and army was so dilatory that the French got intelligence of the

design, and were prepared to receive them. The English found Brest so well

guarded as to render an attempt on that place impracticable; but, landing

at Conquet, they plundered and burnt the town, with some adjacent

villages, and were proceeding to commit greater disorders, when Kersimon,

a Breton gentleman, at the head of some militia, fell upon them, put them

to rout, and drove them to their ships with considerable loss. But a small

squadron of ten English ships had an opportunity of amply revenging this

disgrace upon the French. The mareschal de Thermes, governor of Calais,

had made an irruption into Flanders, with an army of fourteen thousand

men, and, having forced a passage over the River Aa, had taken Dunkirk and

Berg St. Winoc, and had advanced as far as Newport; but Count Egmont

coming suddenly upon him with superior forces, he was obliged to retreat;

and being overtaken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, and finding a battle

inevitable, he chose very skilfully his ground for the engagement. He

fortified his left wing with all the precautions possible, and posted his

right along the River Aa, which, he reasonably thought, gave him full

security from that quarter. But the English ships, which were accidently

on the coast, being drawn by the noise of the firing, sailed up the river,

and, flanking the French, did such execution by their artillery that they

put them to flight, and the Spaniards gained a complete victory.[*]

 

Meanwhile the principal army of France under the duke of Guise, and that

of Spain under the duke of Savoy, approached each other on the frontiers

of Picardy; and as the two kings had come into their respective camps,

attended by the flower of their nobility, men expected that some great and

important event would follow from the emulation of these warlike nations.

But Philip, though actuated by the ambition, possessed not the

enterprising genius of a conqueror; and he was willing, notwithstanding

the superiority of his numbers, and the two great victories which he had

gained at St. Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by

treaty. Negotiations were entered into for that purpose; and as the terms

offered by the two monarchs were somewhat wide of each other, the armies

were put into winter quarters till the princes could come to better

agreement. Among other conditions, Henry demanded the restitution of

Navarre to its lawful owner; Philip, that of Calais and its territory to

England; but in the midst of these negotiations, news arrived of the death

of Mary; and Philip, no longer connected with England, began to relax in

his firmness on that capital article. This was the only circumstance that

could have made the death of that princess be regretted by the nation.

 

Mary had long been in a declining state of health; and having mistaken her

dropsy for a pregnancy, she had made use of an improper regimen, and her

malady daily augmented. Every reflection now tormented her. The

consciousness of being hated by her subjects, the prospect of Elizabeth’s

succession, apprehensions of the danger to which the Catholic religion

stood exposed, dejection for the loss of Calais, concern for the ill state

of her affairs, and, above all, anxiety for the absence of her husband,

who, she knew, intended soon to depart for Spain, and to settle there

during the remainder of his life,—all these melancholy reflections

preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which she

died, after a short and unfortunate reign of five years four months and

eleven days.

 

It is not necessary to employ many words in drawing the character of this

princess. She possessed few qualities either estimable or amiable; and her

person was as little engaging as her behavior and address. Obstinacy,

bigotry, violence, cruelty, malignity, revenge, tyranny; every

circumstance of her character took a tincture from her bad temper and

narrow understanding. And amidst that complication of vices which entered

into her composition, we shall scarcely find any virtue but sincerity; a

quality which she seems to have maintained throughout her whole life;

except in the beginning of her reign, when the necessity of her affairs

obliged her to make some promises to the Protestants, which she certainly

never intended to perform. But in these cases a weak, bigoted woman, under

the government of priests, easily finds casuistry sufficient to justify to

herself the violation of a promise. She appears, also, as well as her

father, to have been susceptible of some attachments of friendship; and

that without the caprice and inconstancy which were so remarkable in the

conduct of that monarch. To which we may add, that in many circumstances

of her life she gave indications of resolution and vigor of mind, a

quality which seems to have been inherent in her family.

 

Cardinal Pole had long been sickly from an intermitting fever; and he died

the same day with the queen, about sixteen hours after her. The benign

character of this prelate, the modesty and humanity of his deportment,

made him be universally beloved; insomuch that in a nation where the most

furious persecution was carried on, and where the most violent religious

factions prevailed, entire justice, even by most of the reformers, has

been done to his merit. The haughty pontiff, Paul IV., had entertained

some prejudices against him; and when England declared war against Henry,

the ally of that pope, he seized the opportunity of revenge; and revoking

Pole’s legatine commission, appointed in his room Cardinal Peyto, an

Observantine friar, and confessor to the queen. But Mary would never

permit the new legate to act upon the commission; and Paul was afterwards

obliged to restore Cardinal Pole to his authority.

 

There occur few general remarks, besides what have already been made in

the course of our narration, with regard to the general state of the

kingdom during this reign. The naval power of England was then so

inconsiderable, that fourteen thousand pounds being ordered to be applied

to the fleet, both for repairing and victualling it, it was computed that

ten thousand pounds a year would afterwards answer all necessary

charges.[*]

 

The arbitrary proceedings of the queen above mentioned, joined to many

monopolies granted by this princess, as well as by her father, checked the

growth of commerce; and so much the more, as all other princes in Europe

either were not permitted, or did not find it necessary, to proceed in so

tyrannical a manner. Acts of parliament, both in the last reign and in the

beginning of the present, had laid the same impositions on the merchants

of the still-yard as on other aliens; yet the queen, immediately after her

marriage, complied with the solicitations of the emperor, and by her

prerogative suspended those laws.[*] Nobody in that age pretended to

question this exercise of prerogative. The historians are entirely silent

with regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public papers that

it is handed down to us.

 

An absurd law had been made in the preceding reign, by which every one was

prohibited from making cloth unless he had served an apprenticeship of

seven years. The law was repealed in the first year of the queen; and this

plain reason given, that it had occasioned the decay of the woollen

manufacture, and had ruined several towns.[**] It is strange that Edward’s

law should have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and still more

strange that it should still subsist.

 

A passage to Archangel had been discovered by the English during the last

reign; and a beneficial trade with Muscovy had been established. A solemn

embassy was sent by the czar to Queen Mary. The ambassadors were

shipwrecked on the coast of Scotland; but being hospitably entertained

there, they proceeded on the journey, and were received at London with

great pomp and solemnity.[***] This seems to have been the first

intercourse which that empire had with any of the western potentates of

Europe.

 

A law was passed in this reign,[****] by which the number of horses, arms

and furniture, was fixed which each person, according to the extent of his

property, should be provided with for the defence of the kingdom. A man of

a thousand pounds a year, for instance, was obliged to maintain at his own

charge six horses fit for demi-lances, of which three at least to be

furnished with sufficient harness, steel saddles, and weapons proper for

the demi-lances; and ten horses fit for light horsemen, with furniture and

weapons proper for them: he was obliged to have forty corselets furnished;

fifty almain revets, or, instead of them, forty coats of plate, corse,

etc. or brigandines furnished; forty pikes, thirty long bows, thirty

sheafs of arrows, thirty steel caps or skulls, twenty black bills or

halberts, twenty harquebuts, and twenty morions or sallets. We may remark

that a man of a thousand marks of stock was rated equal to one of two

hundred pounds a year; a proof that few or none at that time lived on

their stock in money, and that great profits were made by the merchants in

the course of trade. There is no class above a thousand pounds a year.

 

We pay form a notion of the little progress made in arts and refinement

about this time, from one circumstance; a man of no less rank than the

comptroller of Edward VI.‘s household paid only thirty shillings a year of

our present money for his house in Channel Row;[*] yet labor and

provisons, and consequently houses, were only about a third of the present

price. Erasmus ascribes the frequent plagues in England to the nastiness,

and dirt, and slovenly habits among the people. “The floors,” says he,

“are commonly of clay, strewed with rushes, under which lies unmolested an

ancient collection of beer, grease, fragments, bones, spittle, excrements

of dogs and cats, and every thing that is nasty.”[**]

 

Holingshed, who lived in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, gives a very curious

account of the plain, or rather rude way of living of the preceding

generation. There scarcely was a chimney to the houses, even in

considerable towns; the fire was kindled by the wall, and the smoke sought

its way out at the roof, or door, or windows: the houses were nothing but

watling plastered over with clay; the people slept on straw pallets, and

had a good round log under their head for a pillow; and almost all the

furniture and utensils were of wood.[***] 22
 

In this reign we find the first general law with regard to highways, which

were appointed to be repaired by parish duty all over England.[****
