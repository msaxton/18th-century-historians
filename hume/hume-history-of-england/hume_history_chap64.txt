The next session of parliament discovered a continuance of the same

principles which had prevailed in all the foregoing. Monarchy and the

church were still the objects of regard and affection. During no period of

the present reign did this spirit more evidently pass the bounds of reason

and moderation.

 

The king, in his speech to the parliament, had ventured openly to demand a

repeal of the triennial act; and he even went so far as to declare that,

notwithstanding the law, he never would allow any parliament to be

assembled by the methods prescribed in that statute. The parliament,

without taking offence at this declaration, repealed the law; and in lieu

of all the securities formerly provided, satisfied themselves with a

general clause, “that parliament should not be interrupted above three

years at the most.” As the English parliament had now raised itself to be

a regular check and control upon royal power, it is evident that they

ought still to have preserved a regular security for their meeting, and

not have trusted entirely to the good will of the king, who, if ambitious

or enterprising, had so little reason to be pleased with these assemblies.

Before the end of Charles’s reign, the nation had occasion to feel very

sensibly the effects of this repeal.

 

By the act of uniformity, every clergyman who should officiate without

being properly qualified, was punishable by fine and imprisonment: but

this security was not thought sufficient for the church. It was now

enacted, that, wherever five persons above those of the same household

should assemble in a religious congregation, every one of them was liable,

for the first offence, to be imprisoned three months, or pay five pounds;

for the second, to be imprisoned six months, or pay ten pounds; and for

the third, to be transported seven years, or pay a hundred pounds. The

parliament had only in their eye the malignity of the sectaries; they

should have carried their attention further, to the chief cause of that

malignity, the restraint under which they labored.

 

The commons likewise passed a vote, that the wrongs, dishonors, and

indignities offered to the English by the subjects of the United

Provinces, were the greatest obstructions to all foreign trade: and they

promised to assist the king with their lives and fortunes in asserting the

rights of his crown against all opposition whatsoever. This was the first

open step towards a Dutch war. We must explain the causes and motives of

this measure.

 

That close union and confederacy which, during a course of near seventy

years, has subsisted, almost without interruption or jealousy, between

England and Holland, is not so much founded on the natural, unalterable

interests of these states, as on their terror of the growing power of the

French monarch, who, without their combination, it is apprehended, would

soon extend his dominion over Europe. In the first years of Charles’s

reign, when the ambitious genius of Lewis had not as yet displayed itself,

and when the great force of his people was in some measure unknown even to

themselves, the rival-ship of commerce, not checked by any other jealousy

or apprehension, had in England begotten a violent enmity against the

neighboring republic.

 

Trade was beginning among the English to be a matter of general concern;

but notwithstanding all their efforts and advantages, their commerce

seemed hitherto to stand upon a footing which was somewhat precarious. The

Dutch, who by industry and frugality were enabled to undersell them in

every market, retained possession of the most lucrative branches of

commerce; and the English merchants had the mortification to find, that

all attempts to extend their trade were still turned, by the vigilance of

their rivals, to their loss and dishonor. Their indignation increased,

when they considered the superior naval power of England; the bravery of

her officers and seamen; her favorable situation, which enabled her to

intercept the whole Dutch commerce. By the prospect of these advantages,

they were strongly prompted, from motives less just and political, to make

war upon the states; and at once to ravish from them by force what they

could not obtain, or could obtain but slowly, by superior skill and

industry.

 

The careless, unambitious temper of Charles rendered him little capable of

forming so vast a project as that of engrossing the commerce and naval

power of Europe; yet could he not remain altogether insensible to such

obvious and such tempting prospects. His genius, happily turned towards

mechanics, had inclined him to study naval affairs, which, of all branches

of business, he both loved the most and understood the best. Though the

Dutch, during his exile, had expressed towards him more civility and

friendship than he had received from any other foreign power, the

Louvestein or aristocratic faction, which at this time ruled the

commonwealth, had fallen into close union with France; and could that

party be subdued, he might hope that his nephew, the young prince of

Orange, would be reinstated in the authority possessed by his ancestors,

and would bring the states to a dependence under England. His narrow

revenues made it still requisite for him to study the humors of his

people, which now ran violently towards war; and it has been suspected,

though the suspicion was not justified by the event, that the hopes of

diverting some of the supplies to his private use were not overlooked by

this necessitous monarch.

 

The duke of York, more active and enterprising, pushed more eagerly the

war with Holland. He desired an opportunity of distinguishing himself: he

loved to cultivate commerce: he was at the head of a new African company,

whose trade was extremely checked by the settlements of the Dutch: and

perhaps the religious prejudices by which that prince was always so much

governed, began, even so early, to instil into him an antipathy against a

Protestant commonwealth, the bulwark of the reformation. Clarendon and

Southampton, observing that the nation was not supported by any foreign

alliance, were averse to hostilities; but their credit was now on the

decline.

 

By these concurring motives, the court and parliament were both of them

inclined to a Dutch war. The parliament was prorogued without voting

supplies: but as they had been induced, without any open application from

the crown, to pass that vote above mentioned against the Dutch

encroachments, it was reasonably considered as sufficient sanction for the

rigorous measures which were resolved on.

 

Downing, the English minister at the Hague, a man of an insolent,

impetuous temper, presented a memorial to the states, containing a list of

those depredations of which the English complained. It is remarkable, that

all the pretended depreciations preceded the year 1662, when a treaty of

league and alliance had been renewed with the Dutch; and these complaints

were then thought either so ill grounded or so frivolous, that they had

not been mentioned in the treaty. Two ships alone, the Bonaventure and the

Good Hope, had been claimed by the English; and it was agreed that the

claim should be prosecuted by the ordinary course of justice. The states

had consigned a sum of money, in case the cause should be decided against

them; but the matter was still in dependence. Cary who was intrusted by

the proprietors with the management of the lawsuit for the Bonaventure,

had resolved to accept of thirty thousand pounds, which were offered him;

but was hindered by Downing, who told him that the claim was a matter of

state between the two nations, not a concern of private persons.[*] These

circumstances give us no favorable idea of the justice of the English

pretensions.

 

Charles confined not himself to memorials and remonstrances. Sir Robert

Holmes was secretly despatched with a squadron of twenty-two ships to the

coast of Africa. He not only expelled the Dutch from Cape Corse, to which

the English had some pretensions; he likewise seized the Dutch settlements

of Cape Verde and the Isle of Goree, together with several ships trading

on that coast. And having sailed to America, he possessed himself of Nova

Belgia, since called New York; a territory which James I. had given by

patent to the earl of Stirling, but which had never been planted but by

the Hollanders. When the states complained of these hostile measures, the

king, unwilling to avow what he could not well justify, pretended to be

totally ignorant of Holmes’s enterprise. He likewise confined that admiral

to the Tower; but some time after released him.

 

The Dutch, finding that their applications for redress were likely to be

eluded, and that a ground of quarrel was industriously sought for by the

English, began to arm with diligence. They even exerted, with some

precipitation, an act of vigor which hastened on the rupture. Sir John

Lawson and De Ruyter had been sent with combined squadrons into the

Mediterranean, in order to chastise the piratical states on the coast of

Barbary; and the time of their separation and return was now approaching.

The states secretly despatched orders to De Ruyter, that he should take in

provisions at Cadiz; and sailing towards the coast of Guinea, should

retaliate on the English, and put the Dutch in possession of those

settlements whence Holmes had expelled them. De Ruyter, having a

considerable force on board, met with no opposition in Guinea.

 

All the new acquisitions of the English, except Cape Corse were recovered

from them. They were even dispossessed of some old settlements. Such of

their ships as fell into his hands were seized by De Ruyter. That admiral

sailed next to America. He attacked Barbadoes, but was repulsed. He

afterwards committed hostilities on Long Island.

 

Meanwhile the English preparations for war were advancing with vigor and

industry. The king had received no supplies from parliament; but by his

own funds and credit he was enabled to equip a fleet: the city of London

lent him one hundred thousand pounds: the spirit of the nation seconded

his armaments: he himself went from port to port, inspecting with great

diligence, and encouraging the work; and in a little time the English navy

was put in a formidable condition. Eight hundred thousand pounds are said

to have been expended on this armament. When Lawson arrived, and

communicated his suspicion of De Ruyter’s enterprise, orders were issued

for seizing all Dutch ships; and one hundred and thirty-five fell into the

hands of the English. These were not declared prizes till afterwards, when

war was proclaimed.

 

The parliament, when it met, granted a supply, the largest by far that had

ever been given to a king of England, yet scarcely sufficient for the

present undertaking. Near two millions and a half were voted, to be levied

by quarterly payments in three years. The avidity of the merchants,

together with the great prospect of success, had animated the whole nation

against the Dutch.

 

A great alteration was made this session in the method of taxing the

clergy. In almost all the other monarchies of Europe, the assemblies,

whose consent was formerly requisite to the enacting of laws, were

composed of three estates, the clergy, the nobility, and the commonalty,

which formed so many members of the political body, of which the king was

considered as the head. In England too, the parliament was always

represented as consisting of three estates; but their separation was never

so distinct as in other kingdoms. A convocation, however, had usually

sitten at the same time with the parliament; though they possessed not a

negative voice in the passing of laws, and assumed no other temporal power

than that of imposing taxes on the clergy. By reason of ecclesiastical

preferments, which he could bestow, the king’s influence over the church

was more considerable than over the laity; so that the subsidies granted

by the convocation were commonly greater than those which were voted by

parliament. The church, therefore, was not displeased to depart tacitly

from the right of taxing herself, and allow the commons to lay impositions

on ecclesiastical revenues, as on the rest of the kingdom. In recompense,

two subsidies, which the convocation had formerly granted, were remitted,

and the parochial clergy were allowed to vote at elections. Thus the

church of England made a barter of power for profit. Their convocations,

having become insignificant to the crown, have been much disused of late

years.

 

The Dutch saw, with the utmost regret, a war approaching, whence they

might dread the most fatal consequences, but which afforded no prospect of

advantage. They tried every art of negotiation, before they would come to

extremities. Their measures were at that time directed by John de Wit, a

minister equally eminent for greatness of mind, for capacity, and for

integrity. Though moderate in his private deportment, he knew how to adopt

in his public counsels that magnanimity which suits the minister of a

great state. It was ever his maxim, that no independent government should

yield to another any evident point of reason or equity; and that all such

concessions, so far from preventing war, served to no other purpose than

to provoke fresh claims and insults. By his management a spirit of union

was preserved in all the provinces; great sums were levied; and a navy was

equipped, composed of larger ships than the Dutch had ever built before,

and able to cope with the fleet of England.

 

1665

 

As soon as certain intelligence arrived of De Ruyter’s enterprises,

Charles declared war against the states. His fleet, consisting of one

hundred and fourteen sail, besides fireships and ketches, was commanded by

the duke of York, and under him by Prince Rupert and the earl of Sandwich.

It had about twenty-two thousand men on board. Obdam, who was admiral of

the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force, declined not the combat. In the

heat of action, when engaged in close fight with the duke of York, Obdam’s

ship blew up. This accident much discouraged the Dutch, who fled towards

their own coast. Tromp alone, son of the famous admiral killed during the

former war, bravely sustained with his squadron the efforts of the

English, and protected the rear of his countrymen. The vanquished had

nineteen ships sunk and taken. The victors lost only one. Sir John Lawson

died soon after of his wounds. It is affirmed, and with an appearance of

reason, that this victory might have been rendered more complete, had not

orders been issued to slacken sail by Brounker, one of the duke’s

bed-chamber, who pretended authority from his master. The duke disclaimed

the orders; but Brounker never was sufficiently punished for his

temerity.[*] It is allowed, however, that the duke behaved with great

bravery during the action. He was long in the thickest of the fire. The

earl of Falmouth, Lord Muskerry, and Mr. Boyle, were killed by one shot at

his side, and covered him all over with their brains and gore. And it is

not likely, that, in a pursuit, where even persons of inferior station,

and of the most cowardly disposition, acquire courage, a commander should

feel his spirits to flag ana should turn from the back of an enemy, whose

face he had not been afraid to encounter.

 

This disaster threw the Dutch into consternation, and determined De Wit,

who was the soul of their councils, to exert his military capacity, in

order to support the declining courage of his countrymen. He went on board

the fleet, which he took under his command; and he soon remedied all those

disorders which had been occasioned by the late misfortune. The genius of

this man was of the most extensive nature. He quickly became as much

master of naval affairs, as if he had from his infancy been educated in

them; and he even made improvements in some parts of pilotage and sailing,

beyond what men expert in those arts had ever been able to attain.

 

The misfortunes of the Dutch determined their allies to act for their

assistance and support. The king of France was engaged in a defensive

alliance with the states; but as his naval force was yet in its infancy,

he was extremely averse, at that time, from entering into a war with so

formidable a power as England. He long tried to mediate a peace between

the states, and for that purpose sent an embassy to London, which returned

without effecting any thing. Lord Hollis, the English ambassador at Paris,

endeavored to draw over Lewis to the side of England; and, in his master’s

name, made him the most tempting offers. Charles was content to abandon

all the Spanish Low Countries to the French, without pretending to a foot

of ground for himself, provided Lewis would allow him to pursue his

advantages against the Dutch.[*] But the French monarch, though the

conquest of that valuable territory was the chief object of his ambition,

rejected the offer as contrary to his interests: he thought, that if the

English had once established an uncontrollable dominion over the sea and

over commerce, they would soon be able to render his acquisitions a dear

purchase to him. When De Lionne, the French secretary, assured Van

Beuninghen, ambassador of the states, that this offer had been pressed on

his master during six months, “I can readily believe it,” replied the

Dutchman; “I am sensible that it is the interest of England.”[**]

 

Such were the established maxims at that time with regard to the interests

of princes. It must, however, be allowed, that the politics of Charles, in

making this offer, were not a little hazardous. The extreme weakness of

Spain would have rendered the French conquests easy and infallible; but

the vigor of the Dutch, it might be foreseen, would make the success of

the English much more precarious. And even were the naval force of Holland

totally annihilated, the acquisition of the Dutch commerce to England

could not be relied on as a certain consequence; nor is trade a constant

attendant of power, but depends on many other, and some of them very

delicate, circumstances.

 

Though the king of France was resolved to support the Hollanders in that

unequal contest in which they were engaged, he yet protracted his

declaration, and employed the time in naval preparations, both in the

ocean and the Mediterranean. The king of Denmark, meanwhile, was resolved

not to remain an idle spectator of the contest between the maritime

powers. The part which he acted was the most extraordinary: he made a

secret agreement with Charles to seize all the Dutch ships in his harbors,

and to share the spoils with the English, provided they would assist him

in executing this measure. In order to increase his prey, he perfidiously

invited the Dutch to take shelter in his ports; and accordingly the East

India fleet, very richly laden, had put into Bergen. Sandwich, who now

commanded the English navy, (the duke having gone ashore,) despatched Sir

Thomas Tiddiman with a squadron to attack them; but whether from the king

of Denmark’s delay in sending orders to the governor, or, what is more

probable, from his avidity in endeavoring to engross the whole booty, the

English admiral, though he behaved with great bravery, failed of his

purpose. The Danish governor fired upon him; and the Dutch, having had

leisure to fortify themselves, made a gallant resistance.

 

The king of Denmark, seemingly ashamed of his conduct, concluded with Sir

Gilbert Talbot, the English envoy, an offensive alliance against the

states; and at the very same time, his resident at the Hague, by his

orders, concluded an offensive alliance against England. To this latter

alliance he adhered, probably from jealousy of the increasing naval power

of England; and he seized and confiscated all the English ships in his

harbors. This was a sensible check to the advantages which Charles had

obtained over the Dutch. Not only a blow was given to the English

commerce; the king of Denmark’s naval force was also considerable, and

threatened every moment a conjunction with the Hollanders. That prince

stipulated to assist his ally with a fleet of thirty sail; and he received

in return a yearly subsidy of one million five hundred thousand crowns, of

which three hundred thousand were paid by France.

 

The king endeavored to counterbalance these confederacies by acquiring new

friends and allies. He had despatched Sir Richard Fanshaw into Spain, who

met with a very cold reception. That monarchy was sunk into a state of

weakness, and was menaced with an invasion from France; yet could not any

motive prevail with Philip to enter into cordial friendship with England.

Charles’s alliance with Portugal, the detention of Jamaica and Tangiers,

the sale of Dunkirk to the French, all these offences sunk so deep in the

mind of the Spanish monarch, that no motive of interest was sufficient to

outweigh them.

 

The bishop of Munster was the only ally that Charles could acquire. This

prelate, a man of restless enterprise and ambition, had entertained a

violent animosity against the states and he was easily engaged, by the

promise of subsidies from England, to make an incursion on that republic.

With a tumultuary army of near twenty thousand men, he invaded her

territories, and met with weak resistance. The land forces of the states

were as feeble and ill governed, as their fleets were gallant and

formidable. But after his committing great ravages in several of the

provinces, a stop was put to the progress of this warlike prelate. He had

not military skill sufficient to improve the advantages which fortune had

put into his hands: the king of France sent a body of six thousand men to

oppose him: subsidies were not regularly remitted him from England; and

many of his troops deserted for want of pay: the elector of Brandenburgh

threatened him with an invasion in his own state; and on the whole, he was

glad to conclude a peace under the mediation of France. On the first

surmise of his intentions, Sir William Temple was sent from London with

money to fix him in his former alliance; but found that he arrived too

late.

 

The Dutch, encouraged by all these favorable circumstances, continued

resolute to exert themselves to the utmost in their own defence. De

Ruyter, their great admiral, was arrived from his expedition to Guinea:

their Indian fleet was come home in safety: their harbors were crowded

with merchant ships: faction at home was appeased: the young prince of

Orange had put himself under the tuition of the states of Holland, and of

De Wit, their pensionary, who executed his trust with honor and fidelity;

and the animosity which the Hollanders entertained against the attack of

the English, so unprovoked, as they thought it, made them thirst for

revenge, and hope for better success in their next enterprise. Such vigor

was exerted in the common cause, that, in order to man the fleet, all

merchant ships were prohibited to sail, and even the fisheries were

suspended.[*]

 

The English likewise continued in the same disposition, though another

more grievous calamity had joined itself to that of war. The plague had

broken out in London; and that with such violence as to cut off, in a

year, near ninety thousand inhabitants. The king was obliged to summon the

Parliament at Oxford.

 

A good agreement still subsisted between the king and parliament. They, on

their part, unanimously voted him the supply demanded, twelve hundred and

fifty thousand pounds, to be levied in two years by monthly assessments.

And he, to gratify them, passed the five-mile act, which has given

occasion to grievous and not unjust complaints. The church, under pretence

of guarding monarchy against its inveterate enemies, persevered in the

project of wreaking her own enmity against the nonconformists. It was

enacted, that no dissenting teacher, who took not the nonresistance oath

above mentioned, should, except upon the road, come within five miles of

any corporation, or of any place, where he had preached after the act of

oblivion. The penalty was a fine of fifty pounds, and six months’

imprisonment. By ejecting the nonconforming clergy from their churches,

and prohibiting all separate congregations, they had been rendered

incapable of gaining any livelihood by their spiritual profession. And

now, under color of removing them from places where their influence might

be dangerous, an expedient was fallen upon to deprive them of all means of

subsistence. Had not the spirit of the nation undergone a change, these

violences were preludes to the most furious persecution.

 

However prevalent the hierarchy, this law did not pass without opposition.

Besides several peers, attached to the old parliamentary party,

Southampton himself, though Clarendon’s great friend, expressed his

disapprobation of these measures. But the church party, not discouraged

with this opposition, introduced into the house of commons a bill for

imposing the oath of nonresistance on the whole nation. It was rejected

only by three voices. The parliament, after a short session, was

prorogued.

 

1666

 

After France had declared war, England was evidently overmatched in force.

Yet she possessed this advantage by her situation, that she lay between

the fleets of her enemies, and might be able, by speedy and well-concerted

operations, to prevent their junction. But such was the unhappy conduct of

her commanders, or such the want of intelligence in her ministers, that

this circumstance turned rather to her prejudice. Lewis had given orders

to the duke of Beaufort, his admiral, to sail from Toulon; and the French

squadron under his command, consisting of above forty sail,[*] was now

commonly supposed to be entering the Channel.

 

The Dutch fleet, to the number of seventy-six sail, was at sea, under the

command of De Ruyter and Tromp, in order to join him. The duke of

Albemarle and Prince Rupert commanded the English fleet, which exceeded

not seventy-four sail. Albemarle, who, from his successes under the

protector, had too much learned to despise the enemy, proposed to detach

Prince Rupert with twenty ships, in order to oppose the duke of Beaufort.

Sir George Ayscue, well acquainted with the bravery and conduct of De

Ruyter, protested against the temerity of this resolution: but Albemarle’s

authority prevailed. The remainder of the English set sail to give battle

to the Dutch; who, seeing the enemy advance quickly upon them, cut their

cables, and prepared for the combat. The battle that ensued is one of the

most memorable that we read of in story; whether we consider its long

duration, or the desperate courage with which it was fought. Albemarle

made here some atonement by his valor for the rashness of the attempt. No

youth, animated by glory and ambitious hopes, could exert himself more

than did this man, who was now in the decline of life, and who had reached

the summit of honors. We shall not enter minutely into particulars. It

will be sufficient to mention the chief events of each day’s engagement.

 

In the first day, Sir William Berkeley, vice-admiral, leading the van,

fell into the thickest of the enemy, was overpowered, and his ship taken.

He himself was found dead in his cabin, all covered with blood. The

English had the weather-gage of the enemy; but as the wind blew so hard

that they could not use their lower tier, they derived but small advantage

from this circumstance. The Dutch shot, however, fell chiefly on their

sails and rigging; and few ships were sunk or much damaged. Chain-shot was

at that time a new invention; commonly attributed to De Wit. Sir John

Harman exerted himself extremely on this day. The Dutch admiral, Evertz,

was killed in engaging him. Darkness parted the combatants.

 

The second day, the wind was somewhat fallen, and the combat became more

steady and more terrible. The English now found, that the greatest valor

cannot compensate the superiority of numbers, against an enemy who is well

conducted, and who is not defective in courage. De Ruyter and Van Tromp,

rivals in glory and enemies from faction, exerted themselves in emulation

of each other; and De Ruyter had the advantage of disengaging and saving

his antagonist, who had been surrounded by the English, and was in the

most imminent danger. Sixteen fresh ships joined the Dutch fleet during

the action: and the English were so shattered, that their fighting ships

were reduced to twenty-eight, and they found themselves obliged to retreat

towards their own coast. The Dutch followed them, and were on the point of

renewing the combat; when a calm, which came a little before night,

prevented the engagement.

 

Next morning, the English were obliged to continue their retreat; and a

proper disposition was made for that purpose. The shattered ships were

ordered to stretch ahead; and sixteen of the most entire followed them in

good order, and kept the enemy in awe. Albemarle himself closed the rear,

and presented an undaunted countenance to his victorious foes. The earl of

Ossory, son of Ormond, a gallant youth, who sought honor and experience in

every action throughout Europe, was then on board the admiral. Albemarle

confessed to him his intention rather to blow up his ship and perish

gloriously, than yield to the enemy. Ossory applauded this desperate

resolution.

 

About two o’clock, the Dutch had come up with their enemy, and were ready

to renew the fight; when a new fleet was descried from the south, crowding

all their sail to reach the scene of action. The Dutch flattered

themselves that Beaufort was arrived to cut off the retreat of the

vanquished: the English hoped, that Prince Rupert had come, to turn the

scale of action. Albemarle, who had received intelligence of the prince’s

approach, bent his course towards him. Unhappily, Sir George Ayscue, in a

ship of a hundred guns, the largest in the fleet, struck on the Galloper

sands, and could receive no assistance from his friends, who were

hastening to join the reÃ«nforcement. He could not even reap the

consolation of perishing with honor, and revenging his death on his

enemies. They were preparing fireships to attack him, and he was obliged

to strike. The English sailors, seeing the necessity, with the utmost

indignation surrendered themselves prisoners.

 

Albemarle and Prince Rupert were now determined to face the enemy; and

next morning, the battle began afresh, with more equal force than ever,

and with equal valor. After long cannonading, the fleets came to a close

combat; which was continued with great violence, till parted by a mist.

The English retired first into their harbors.

 

Though the English, by their obstinate courage, reaped the chief honor in

this engagement it is somewhat uncertain who obtained the victory. The

Hollanders took a few ships; and having some appearances of advantage,

expressed their satisfaction by all the signs of triumph and rejoicing.

But as the English fleet was repaired in a little time, and put to sea

more formidable than ever, together with many of those ships which the

Dutch had boasted to have burned or destroyed, all Europe saw, that those

two brave nations were engaged in a contest which was not likely, on

either side, to prove decisive.

 

It was the conjunction alone of the French, that could give a decisive

superiority to the Dutch. In order to facilitate this conjunction, De

Ruyter, having repaired his fleet, posted himself at the mouth of the

Thames. The English, under Prince Rupert and Albemarle, were not long in

coming to the attack. The numbers of each fleet amounted to about eighty

sail; and the valor and experience of the commanders, as well as of the

seamen, rendered the engagement fierce and obstinate. Sir Thomas Allen,

who commanded the white squadron of the English, attacked the Dutch van,

which he entirely routed; and he killed the three admirals who commanded

it. Van Tromp engaged Sir Jeremy Smith; and during the heat of action, he

was separated from De Ruyter and the main body, whether by accident or

design was never certainly known. De Ruyter, with conduct and valor,

maintained the combat against the main body of the English; and, though

overpowered by numbers, kept his station, till night ended the engagement.

Next day, finding the Dutch fleet scattered and discouraged, his high

spirit submitted to a retreat, which yet he conducted with such skill, as

to render it equally honorable to himself as the greatest victory. Full of

indignation, however, at yielding the superiority to the enemy, he

frequently exclaimed, “My God! what a wretch am I! Among so many thousand

bullets, is there not one to put an end to my miserable life?” One De

Witte, his son-in-law, who stood near, exhorted him, since he sought

death, to turn upon the English, and render his life a dear purchase to

the victors. But De Ruyter esteemed it more worthy a brave man to

persevere to the uttermost, and, as long as possible, to render service to

his country. All that night and next day, the English pressed upon the

rear of the Dutch; and it was chiefly by the redoubled efforts of De

Ruyter, that the latter saved themselves in their harbors.

 

The loss sustained by the Hollanders in this action was not very

considerable; but as violent animosities had broken out between the two

admirals, who engaged all the officers on one side or other, the

consternation which took place was great among the provinces. Tromp’s

commission was at last taken from him; but though several captains had

misbehaved, they were so effectually protected by their friends in the

magistracy of the towns, that most of them escaped punishment, and many

were still continued in their commands.

 

The English now rode incontestable masters of the sea, and insulted the

Dutch in their harbors. A detachment under Holmes was sent into the road

of Vlie, and burned a hundred and forty merchantmen, two men-of-war,

together with Brandaris, a large and rich village on the coast. The Dutch

merchants, who lost by this enterprise, uniting themselves to the Orange

faction, exclaimed against an administration which, they pretended, had

brought such disgrace and ruin on their country. None but the firm and

intrepid mind of De Wit could have supported itself under such a

complication of calamities.

 

The king of France, apprehensive that the Dutch would sink under their

misfortunes, at least that De Wit, his friend, might be dispossessed of

the administration, hastened the advance of the duke of Beaufort. The

Dutch fleet likewise was again equipped; and under the command of De

Ruyter, cruised near the Straits of Dover. Prince Rupert with the English

navy, now stronger than ever, came full sail upon them. The Dutch admiral

thought proper to decline the combat, and retired into St. John’s road,

near Bulloigne. Here he sheltered himself, both from the English, and from

a furious storm which arose. Prince Rupert, too, was obliged to retire

into St. Helens; where he staid some time, in order to repair the damages

which he had sustained. Meanwhile the duke of Beaufort proceeded up the

Channel, and passed the English fleet unperceived; but he did not find the

Dutch, as he expected. De Ruyter had been seized with a fever: many of the

chief officers had fallen into sickness: a contagious distemper was spread

through the fleet: and the states thought it necessary to recall them into

their harbors, before the enemy should be refitted. The French king,

anxious for his navy, which with so much care and industry he had so

lately built, despatched orders to Beaufort, to make the best of his way

to Brest. That admiral had again the good fortune to pass the English. One

ship alone, the Ruby, fell into the hands of the enemy.

 

While the war continued without any decisive success on either side, a

calamity happened in London which threw the people into great

consternation. Fire, breaking out in a baker’s house near the bridge,

spread itself on all sides with such rapidity, that no efforts could

extinguish it, till it laid in ashes a considerable part of the city. The

inhabitants, without being able to provide effectually for their relief,

were reduced to be spectators of their own ruin; and were pursued from

street to street by the flames, which unexpectedly gathered round them.

Three days and nights did the fire advance; and it was only by the blowing

up of houses that it was at last extinguished. The king and duke used

their utmost endeavors to stop the progress of the flames; but all their

industry was unsuccessful. About four hundred streets and thirteen

thousand houses were reduced to ashes.

 

The causes of this calamity were evident. The narrow streets of London,

the houses built entirely of wood, the dry season, and a violent east wind

which blew; these were so many concurring circumstances, which rendered it

easy to assign the reason of the destruction that ensued. But the people

were not satisfied with this obvious account. Prompted by blind rage, some

ascribed the guilt to the republicans, others to the Catholics; though it

is not easy to conceive how the burning of London could serve the purposes

of either party. As the Papists were the chief objects of public

detestation, the rumor which threw the guilt on them was more favorably

received by the people. No proof, however, or even presumption, after the

strictest inquiry by a committee of parliament, ever appeared to authorize

such a calumny; yet, in order to give countenance to the popular

prejudice, the inscription, engraved by authority on the monument,

ascribed this calamity to that hated sect. This clause was erased by order

of King James, when he came to the throne; but after the revolution it was

replaced: so credulous, as well as obstinate, are the people in believing

every thing which flatters their prevailing passion.

 

The fire of London, though at that time a great calamity, has proved in

the issue beneficial both to the city and the kingdom. The city was

rebuilt in a very little time; and care was taken to make the streets

wider and more regular than before. A discretionary power was assumed by

the king to regulate the distribution of the buildings, and to forbid the

use of lath and timber, the materials of which the houses were formerly

composed. The necessity was so urgent, and the occasion so extraordinary

that no exceptions were taken at an exercise of authority which otherwise

might have been deemed illegal. Had the king been enabled to carry his

power still further, and made the houses be rebuilt with perfect

regularity, and entirely upon one plan, he had much contributed to the

convenience, as well as embellishment of the city. Great advantages,

however, have resulted from the alterations though not carried to the full

length. London became much more healthy after the fire. The plague, which

used to break out with great fury twice or thrice every century, and

indeed was always lurking in some corner or other of the city, has

scarcely ever appeared since that calamity.

 

The parliament met soon after, and gave the sanction of law to those

regulations made by royal authority; as well as appointed commissioners

for deciding all such questions of property as might arise from the fire.

They likewise voted a supply of one million eight hundred thousand pounds,

to be levied, partly by a poll-bill, partly by assessments. Though their

inquiry brought out no proofs which could fix on the Papists the burning

of London, the general aversion against that sect still prevailed; and

complaints were made, probably without much foundation, of its dangerous

increase. Charles, at the desire of the commons, issued a proclamation for

the banishment of all priests and Jesuits; but the bad execution of this,

as well as of former edicts, destroyed all confidence in his sincerity,

whenever he pretended an aversion towards the Catholic religion. Whether

suspicions of this nature had diminished the king’s popularity, is

uncertain; but it appears that the supply was voted much later than

Charles expected, or even than the public necessities seemed to require.

The intrigues of the duke of Buckingham, a man who wanted only steadiness

to render him extremely dangerous, had somewhat embarrassed the measures

of the court: and this was the first time that the king found any

considerable reason to complain of a failure of confidence in this house

of commons. The rising symptoms of ill humor tended, no doubt, to quicken

the steps which were already making towards a peace with foreign enemies.

 

Charles began to be sensible, that all the ends for which the war had been

undertaken were likely to prove entirely abortive. The Dutch, even when

single, had defended themselves with vigor, and were every day improving

in their military skill and preparations.

 

1667

 

Though their trade had suffered extremely, their extensive credit enabled

them to levy great sums; and while the seamen of England loudly complained

of want of pay, the Dutch navy was regularly supplied with money and every

thing requisite for its subsistence. As two powerful kings now supported

them, every place, from the extremity of Norway to the coasts of Bayonne,

was become hostile to the English. And Charles, neither fond of action,

nor stimulated by any violent ambition, earnestly sought for means of

restoring tranquillity to his people, disgusted with a war, which, being

joined with the plague and fire, had proved so fruitless and destructive.

 

The first advances towards an accommodation were made by England. When the

king sent for the body of Sir William Berkeley, he insinuated to the

states his desire of peace on reasonable terms; and their answer

corresponded in the same amicable intentions. Charles, however, to

maintain the appearance of superiority, still insisted that the states

should treat at London; and they agreed to make him this compliment so far

as concerned themselves: but being engaged in alliance with two crowned

heads, they could not, they said, prevail with these to depart in that

respect from their dignity. On a sudden, the king went so far on the other

side as to offer the sending of ambassadors to the Hague; but this

proposal, which seemed honorable to the Dutch, was meant only to divide

and distract them, by affording the English an opportunity to carry on

cabals with the disaffected party. The offer was therefore rejected; and

conferences were secretly held in the queen mother’s apartments at Paris,

where the pretensions of both parties were discussed. The Dutch made

equitable proposals; either that all things should be restored to the same

condition in which they stood before the war, or that both parties should

continue in possession of their present acquisitions. Charles accepted of

the latter proposal; and almost every thing was adjusted, except the

disputes with regard to the Isle of Polerone. This island lies in the East

Indies, and was formerly valuable for its produce of spices. The English

had been masters of it, but were dispossessed at the time when the

violences were committed against them at Amboyna. Cromwell had stipulated

to have it restored; and the Hollanders, having first entirely destroyed

all the spice trees, maintained that they had executed the treaty, but

that the English had been anew expelled during the course of the war.

Charles renewed his pretensions to this island; and as the reasons on both

sides began to multiply, and seemed to require a long discussion, it was

agreed to transfer the treaty to some other place; and Charles made choice

of Breda.

 

Lord Hollis and Henry Coventry were the English ambassadors. They

immediately desired that a suspension of arms should be agreed to, till

the several claims should be adjusted; but this proposal, seemingly so

natural, was rejected by the credit of De Wit. That penetrating and active

minister, thoroughly acquainted with the characters of princes and the

situation of affairs, had discovered an opportunity of striking a blow,

which might at once restore to the Dutch the honor lost during the war,

and severely revenge those injuries which he ascribed to the wanton

ambition and injustice of the English.

 

Whatever projects might have been formed by Charles for secreting the

money granted him by parliament, he had hitherto failed in his intention.

The expenses of such vast armaments had exhausted all the supplies,[*] and

even a great debt was contracted to the seamen. The king, therefore, was

resolved to save, as far as possible, the last supply of one million eight

hundred thousand pounds; and to employ it for payment of his debts, as

well those which had been occasioned by the war, as those which he had

formerly contracted. He observed, that the Dutch had been with great

reluctance forced into the war, and that the events of it were not such as

to inspire them with great desire of its continuance. The French, he knew,

had been engaged into hostilities by no other motive than that of

supporting their ally; and were now more desirous than ever of putting an

end to the quarrel. The differences between the parties were so

inconsiderable, that the conclusion of peace appeared infallible; and

nothing but forms, at least some vain points of honor, seemed to remain

for the ambassadors at Breda to discuss. In this situation, Charles, moved

by an ill-timed frugality, remitted his preparations, and exposed England

to one of the greatest affronts which it has ever received. Two small

squadrons alone were equipped, and during a war with such potent and

martial enemies, every thing was left almost in the same situation as in

times of the most profound tranquillity.

 

De Wit protracted the negotiations at Breda, and hastened the naval

preparations. The Dutch fleet appeared in the Thames, under the command of

De Ruyter, and threw the English into the utmost consternation. A chain

had been drawn across the River Medway; some fortifications had been added

to Sheerness and Upnore Castle; but all these preparations were unequal to

the present necessity. Sheerness was soon taken; nor could it be saved by

the valor of Sir Edward Sprague, who defended it. Having the advantage of

a spring tide and an easterly wind, the Dutch pressed on, and broke the

chain, though fortified by some ships, which had been there sunk by orders

of the duke of Albemarle. They burned the three ships which lay to guard

the chain—the Matthias, the Unity, and the Charles V. After damaging

several vessels, and possessing themselves of the hull of the Royal

Charles, which the English had burned, they advanced with six men-of-war

and five fireships as far as Upnore Castle, where they burned the Royal

Oak, the Loyal London, and the Great James. Captain Douglas, who commanded

on board the Royal Oak, perished in the flames, though he had an easy

opportunity of escaping. “Never was it known,” he said, “that a Douglas

had left his post without orders.”[*] The Hollanders fell down the Medway

without receiving any considerable damage; and it was apprehended, that

they might next tide sail up the Thames, and extend their hostilities even

to the bridge of London. Nine ships were sunk at Woolwich, four at

Blackwall: platforms were raised in many places, furnished with artillery;

the train bands were called out, and every place was in a violent

agitation. The Dutch sailed next to Portsmouth, where they made a

fruitless attempt: they met with no better success at Plymouth: they

insulted Harwich: they sailed again up the Thames as far as Tilbury, where

they were repulsed. The whole coast was in alarm; and had the French

thought proper at this time to join the Dutch fleet, and to invade

England, consequences the most fatal might justly have been apprehended.

But Lewis had no intention to push the victory to such extremities. His

interest required that a balance should be kept between the two maritime

powers; not that an uncontrolled superiority should be given to either.

 

Great indignation prevailed amongst the English, to see an enemy, whom

they regarded as inferior, whom they had expected totally to subdue, and

over whom they had gained many honorable advantages, now of a sudden ride

undisputed masters of the ocean, burn their ships in their very harbors,

fill every place with confusion, and strike a terror into the capital

itself. But though the cause of all these disasters could be ascribed

neither to bad fortune, to the misconduct of admirals, nor to the ill

behavior of seamen, but solely to the avarice, at least to the

improvidence, of the government, no dangerous symptoms of discontent

appeared, and no attempt for an insurrection was made by any of those

numerous sectaries who had been so openly branded for their rebellious

principles, and who, upon that supposition, had been treated with such

severity.[*]

 

In the present distress, two expedients were embraced: an army of twelve

thousand men was suddenly levied; and the parliament, though it lay under

prorogation, was summoned to meet. The houses were very thin; and the only

vote which the commons passed, was an address for breaking the army; which

was complied with. This expression of jealousy showed the court what they

might expect from that assembly; and it was thought more prudent to

prorogue them till next winter.

 

But the signing of the treaty at Breda extricated the king from his

present difficulties. The English ambassadors received orders to recede

from those demands, which, how ever frivolous in themselves, could not now

be relinquished without acknowledging a superiority in the enemy. Polerone

remained with the Dutch; satisfaction for the ships Bonaventure and Good

Hope, the pretended grounds of the quarrel, was no longer insisted on;

Acadie was yielded to the French. The acquisition of New York, a

settlement so important by its situation, was the chief advantage which

the English reaped from a war, in which the national character of bravery

had shone out with lustre, but where the misconduct of the government,

especially in the conclusion, had been no less apparent.

 

To appease the people by some sacrifice seemed requisite before the

meeting of parliament; and the prejudices of the nation pointed out the

victim. The chancellor was at this time much exposed to the hatred of the

public, and of every party which divided the nation. All the numerous

sectaries regarded him as their determined enemy; and ascribed to his

advice and influence those persecuting laws to which they had lately been

exposed. The Catholics knew, that while he retained any authority, all

their credit with the king and the duke would be entirely useless to them,

nor must they ever expect any favor or indulgence. Even the royalists,

disappointed in their sanguine hopes of preferment, threw a great load of

envy on Clarendon, into whose hands the king seemed at first to have

resigned the whole power of government. The sale of Dunkirk, the bad

payment of the seamen, the disgrace at Chatham, the unsuccessful

conclusion of the war all these misfortunes were charged on the

chancellor, who though he had ever opposed the rupture with Holland,

thought it still his duty to justify what he could not prevent. A

building, likewise, of more expense and magnificence than his slender

fortune could afford, being unwarily undertaken by him, much exposed him

to public reproach, as if he had acquired great riches by corruption. The

populace gave it commonly the appellation of Dunkirk House.

 

 ENLARGE
 

The king himself, who had always more revered than loved the chancellor,

was now totally estranged from him. Amidst the dissolute manners of the

court, that minister still maintained an inflexible dignity, and would not

submit to any condescensions which he deemed unworthy of his age and

character. Buckingham, a man of profligate morals, happy in his talent for

ridicule, but exposed in his own conduct to all the ridicule which he

threw on others, still made him the object of his raillery, and gradually

lessened in the king that regard which he bore to his minister. When any

difficulties arose, either for want of power or money, the blame was still

thrown on him, who, it was believed, had carefully at the restoration

checked all lavish concessions to the king. And what, perhaps, touched

Charles more nearly, he found in Clarendon, it is said, obstacles to his

pleasures, as well as to his ambition.

 

The king, disgusted with the homely person of his consort, and desirous of

having children, had hearkened to proposals of obtaining a divorce, on

pretence either of her being pre-engaged to another, or having made a vow

of chastity before her marriage. He was further stimulated by his passion

for Mrs. Stuart, daughter of a Scotch gentleman; a lady of great beauty,

and whose virtue he had hitherto found impregnable: but Clarendon,

apprehensive of the consequences attending a disputed title, and perhaps

anxious for the succession of his own grandchildren, engaged the duke of

Richmond to marry Mrs. Stuart, and thereby put an end to the king’s hopes.

It is pretended that Charles never forgave this disappointment.

 

When politics, therefore, and inclination both concurred to make the king

sacrifice Clarendon to popular prejudices, the memory of his past services

was not able any longer to delay his fall. The great seal was taken from

him, and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, by the title of lord keeper.

Southampton, the treasurer, was now dead, who had persevered to the utmost

in his attachments to the chancellor. The last time he appeared at the

council table, he exerted his friendship with a vigor which neither age

nor infirmities could abate. “This man,” said he, speaking of Clarendon,

“is a true Protestant, and an honest Englishman; and while he enjoys

power, we are secure of our laws, liberties, and religion. I dread the

consequences of his removal.”

  

But the fall of the chancellor was not sufficient to gratify the malice of

his enemies: his total ruin was resolved on. The duke of York in vain

exerted his interest in behalf of his father-in-law. Both prince and

people united in promoting that violent measure; and no means were thought

so proper for ingratiating the court with a parliament, which had so long

been governed by that very minister who was now to be the victim of their

prejudices.

 

Some popular acts paved the way for the session; and the parliament, in

their first address, gave the king thanks for these instances of his

goodness; and, among the rest, they took care to mention his dismission of

Clarendon. The king, in reply, assured the houses, that he would never

again employ that nobleman in any public office whatsoever. Immediately

the charge against him was opened in the house of commons by Mr. Seymour,

afterwards Sir Edward, and consisted of seventeen articles. The house,

without examining particulars, further than hearing general affirmations

that all would be proved, immediately voted his impeachment. Many of the

articles[*] 1

we know to be either false or frivolous; and such of them as we are less

acquainted with, we may fairly presume to be no better grounded. His

advising the sale of Dunkirk seems the heaviest and truest part of the

charge; but a mistake in judgment, allowing it to be such, where there

appear no symptoms of corruption or bad intentions, it would be very hard

to impute as a crime to any minister. The king’s necessities, which

occasioned that measure, cannot with any appearance of reason be charged

on Clarendon; and chiefly proceeded from the over frugal maxims of the

parliament itself, in not granting the proper supplies to the crown.

 

When the impeachment was carried up to the peers, as it contained an

accusation of treason in general, without specifying any particulars, it

seemed not a sufficient ground for committing Clarendon to custody. The

precedents of Strafford and Laud were not, by reason of the violence of

the times, deemed a proper authority; but as the commons still insisted

upon his commitment, it was necessary to appoint a free conference between

the houses. The lords persevered in their resolution; and the commons

voted this conduct to be an obstruction to public justice, and a precedent

of evil and dangerous tendency. They also chose a committee to draw up a

vindication of their own proceedings.

 

Clarendon, finding that the popular torrent, united to the violence of

power, ran with impetuosity against him, and that a defence offered to

such prejudiced ears would be entirely ineffectual, thought proper to

withdraw. At Calais he wrote a paper addressed to the house of lords. He

there said, that his fortune, which was but moderate, had been gained

entirely by the lawful, avowed profits of his office, and by the voluntary

bounty of the king; that, during the first years after the restoration, he

had always concurred in opinion with the other counsellors, men of such

reputation that no one could entertain suspicions of their wisdom or

integrity: that his credit soon declined; and however he might disapprove

of some measures, he found it vain to oppose them; that his repugnance to

the Dutch war, the source of all the public grievances, was always

generally known, as well as his disapprobation of many unhappy steps taken

in conducting it: and that, whatever pretence might be made of public

offences, his real crime, that which had exasperated his powerful enemies,

was his frequent opposition to exorbitant grants, which the importunity of

suitors had extorted from his majesty.

 

The lords transmitted this paper to the commons, under the appellation of

a libel; and by a vote of both houses it was condemned to be burned by the

hands of the hangman. The parliament next proceeded to exert their

legislative power against Clarendon, and passed a bill of banishment and

incapacity, which received the royal assent. He retired into France, where

he lived in a private manner. He survived his banishment six years; and he

employed his leisure chiefly in reducing into order the History of the

Civil Wars, for which he had before collected materials. The performance

does honor to his memory; and, except Whitlocke’s Memorials, is the most

candid account of those times composed by any contemporary author.

 

Clarendon was always a friend to the liberty and constitution of his

country. At the commencement of the civil wars, he had entered into the

late king’s service, and was honored with a great share in the esteem and

friendship of that monarch: he was pursued with unrelenting animosity by

the long parliament: he had shared all the fortunes and directed all the

counsels of the present king during his exile: he had been advanced to the

highest trust and offices after the restoration: yet all these

circumstances, which might naturally operate with such force, either on

resentment, gratitude, or ambition, had no influence on his uncorrupted

mind. It is said, that when he first engaged in the study of the law, his

father exhorted him with great earnestness to shun the practice, too

common in that profession, of straining every point in favor of

prerogative, and perverting so useful a science to the oppression of

liberty; and in the midst of these rational and virtuous counsels, which

he reiterated, he was suddenly seized with an apoplexy, and expired in his

son’s presence. This circumstance gave additional weight to the principles

which he inculcated.

 

The combination of king and subject to oppress so good a minister, affords

to men of opposite dispositions an equal occasion of inveighing against

the ingratitude of princes, or ignorance of the people. Charles seems

never to have mitigated his resentment against Clarendon; and the national

prejudices pursued him to his retreat in France. A company of English

soldiers, being quartered near him, assaulted his house, broke open the

doors, gave him a dangerous wound on the head, and would have proceeded to

the last extremities, had not their officers, hearing of the violence,

happily interposed.

 

1668

 

The next expedient which the king embraced in order to acquire popularity,

is more deserving of praise; and, had it been steadily pursued, would

probably have rendered his reign happy, certainly his memory respected. It

is the triple alliance of which I speak; a measure which gave entire

satisfaction to the public.

 

The glory of France, which had long been eclipsed, either by domestic

factions, or by the superior force of the Spanish monarchy, began now to

break out with great lustre, and to engage the attention of the

neighboring nations. The independent power and mutinous spirit of the

nobility were subdued; the popular pretensions of the parliament

restrained; the Hugonot party reduced to subjection: that extensive and

fertile country, enjoying every advantage both of climate and situation,

was fully peopled with ingenious and industrious inhabitants: and while

the spirit of the nation discovered all the vigor and bravery requisite

for great enterprises, it was tamed to an entire submission under the will

of the sovereign.

 

The sovereign who now filled the throne was well adapted, by his personal

character, both to increase and to avail himself of these advantages.

Lewis XIV., endowed with every quality which could enchant the people,

possessed many which merit the approbation of the wise. The masculine

beauty of his person was embellished with a noble air: the dignity of his

behavior was tempered with affability and politeness: elegant without

effeminacy, addicted to pleasure without neglecting business, decent in

his very vices, and beloved in the midst of arbitrary power, he surpassed

all contemporary monarchs, as in grandeur, so likewise in fame and glory.

 

His ambition, regulated by prudence, not by justice, had carefully

provided every means of conquest; and before he put himself in motion, he

seemed to have absolutely insured success. His finances were brought into

order; a naval power created; his armies increased and disciplined;

magazines and military stores provided; and though the magnificence of his

court was supported beyond all former example; so regular was the economy

observed, and so willingly did the people, now enriched by arts and

commerce, submit to multiplied taxes, that his military force much

exceeded what in any preceding age had ever been employed by any European

monarch.

 

The sudden decline, and almost total fall of the Spanish monarchy, opened

an inviting field to so enterprising a prince, and seemed to promise him

easy and extensive conquests*[**missing period] The other nations of

Europe, feeble or ill governed, were astonished at the greatness of his

rising empire; and all of them cast their eyes towards England, as the

only power which could save them from that subjection with which they

seemed to be so nearly threatened.

 

The animosity which had anciently subsisted between the English and French

nations, and which had been suspended for above a century by the jealousy

of Spanish greatness, began to revive and to exert itself. The glory of

preserving the balance of Europe, a glory so much founded on justice and

humanity, flattered the ambition of England; and the people were eager to

provide for their own future security, by opposing the progress of so

hated a rival. The prospect of embracing such measures had contributed,

among other reasons, to render the peace of Breda so universally

acceptable to the nation. By the death of Philip IV., king of Spain, an

inviting opportunity, and some very slender pretences, had been afforded

to call forth the ambition of Lewis.

 

At the treaty of the Pyrenees, when Lewis espoused the Spanish princess,

he had renounced every title of succession to every part of the Spanish

monarchy; and this renunciation had been couched in the most accurate and

most precise terms that language could afford. But on the death of his

father-in-law, he retracted his renunciation, and pretended that natural

rights, depending on blood and succession, could not be annihilated by any

extorted deed or contract. Philip had left a son, Charles II. of Spain;

but as the queen of France was of a former marriage, she laid claim to a

considerable province of the Spanish monarchy, even to the exclusion of

her brother. By the customs of some parts of Brabant, a female of a first

marriage was preferred to a male of a second, in the succession to private

inheritances; and Lewis thence inferred, that his queen had acquired a

right to the dominion of that important duchy.

 

A claim of this nature was more properly supported by military force than

by argument and reasoning. Lewis appeared on the frontiers of the

Netherlands with an army of forty thousand men, commanded by the best

generals of the age, and provided with every thing necessary for action.

The Spaniards, though they might have foreseen this measure, were totally

unprepared. Their towns, without magazines, fortifications or garrisons,

fell into the hands of the French king, as soon as he presented himself

before them. Athe, Lisle, Tournay, Oudenarde, Courtray, Charleroi, Binche,

were immediately taken: and it was visible, that no force in the Low

Countries was able to stop or retard the progress of the French arms.

 

This measure, executed with such celerity and success, gave great alarm to

almost every court in Europe. It had been observed with what dignity, or

even haughtiness, Lewis, from the time he began to govern, had ever

supported all his rights and pretensions. D’Estrades, the French

ambassador, and Watteville, the Spanish, having quarrelled in London, on

Account of their claims for precedency, the French monarch was not

satisfied, till Spain sent to Paris a solemn embassy, and promised never

more to revive such contests. Crequi, his ambassador at Rome, had met with

an affront from the pope’s guards: the pope, Alexander VII., had been

constrained to break his guards, to send his nephew to ask pardon, and to

allow a pillar to be erected in Rome itself, as a monument of his own

humiliation. The king of England too had experienced the high spirit and

unsubmitting temper of Lewis. A pretension to superiority in the English

flag having been advanced, the French monarch remonstrated with such

vigor, and prepared himself to resist with such courage, that Charles

found it more prudent to desist from his vain and antiquated claims. “The

king of England,” said Lewis to his ambassador D’Estrades, “may know my

force, but he knows not the sentiments of my heart: every thing appears to

me contemptible in comparison of glory.”[*] These measures of conduct had

given strong indications of his character: but the invasion of Flanders

discovered an ambition, which, being supported by such overgrown power,

menaced the general liberties of Europe.

 

As no state lay nearer the danger, none was seized with more terror than

the United Provinces. They were still engaged, together with France, in a

war against England; and Lewis had promised them, that he would take no

step against Spain without previously informing them: but, contrary to

this assurance, he kept a total silence, till on the very point of

entering upon action. If the renunciation made at the treaty of the

Pyrenees was not valid, it was foreseen, that upon the death of the king

of Spain, a sickly infant, the whole monarchy would be claimed by Lewis;

after which it would be vainly expected to set bounds to his pretensions.

Charles acquainted with these well-grounded apprehensions of the Dutch,

had been the more obstinate in insisting on his own conditions at Breda;

and by delaying to sign the treaty, had imprudently exposed himself to the

signal disgrace which he received at Chatham. De Wit, sensible that a few

weeks’ delay would be of no consequence in the Low Countries, took this

opportunity of striking an important blow, and of finishing the war with

honor to himself and to his country.

 

Negotiations meanwhile commenced for the saving of Flanders; but no

resistance was made to the French arms. The Spanish ministers exclaimed

every where against the flagrant injustice of Lewis’s pretensions, and

represented it to be the interest of every power in Europe, even more than

of Spain itself, to prevent his conquest of the Low Countries. The emperor

and the German princes discovered evident symptoms of discontent; but

their motions were slow and backward. The states, though terrified at the

prospect of having their frontier exposed to so formidable a foe, saw no

resource, no means of safety. England indeed seemed disposed to make

opposition to the French; but the variable and impolitic conduct of

Charles kept that republic from making him any open advances, by which she

might lose the friendship of France, without acquiring any new ally. And

though Lewis, dreading a combination of all Europe, had offered terms of

accommodation, the Dutch apprehended lest these, either from the obstinacy

of the Spaniards, or the ambition of the French, would never be carried

into execution.

 

Charles resolved with great prudence to take the first step towards a

confederacy. Sir William Temple, his resident at Brussels, received orders

to go secretly to the Hague, and to concert with the states the means of

saving the Netherlands. This man, whom philosophy had taught to despise

the world, without rendering him unfit for it, was frank, open, sincere,

superior to the little tricks of vulgar politicians; and meeting in De Wit

with a man of the same generous and enlarged sentiments, he immediately

opened his master’s intentions, and pressed a speedy conclusion. A treaty

was from the first negotiated between these two statesmen with the same

cordiality as if it were a private transaction between intimate

companions. Deeming the interests of their country the same, they gave

full scope to that sympathy of character, which disposed them to an entire

reliance on each other’s professions and engagements. And though jealousy

against the house of Orange might inspire De Wit with an aversion to a

strict union with England, he generously resolved to sacrifice all private

considerations to the public service.

 

Temple insisted on an offensive league between England and Holland, in

order to oblige France to relinquish all her conquests: but De Wit told

him, that this measure was too bold and precipitate to be agreed to by the

states. He said that the French were the old and constant allies of the

republic; and till matters came to extremities, she never would deem it

prudent to abandon a friendship so well established, and rely entirely on

a treaty with England, which had lately waged so cruel a war against her:

that ever since the reign of Elizabeth, there had been such a fluctuation

in the English councils, that it was not possible, for two years together,

to take any sure or certain measures with that kingdom: that though the

present ministry, having entered into views so conformable to national

interest, promised greater firmness and constancy, it might still be

unsafe, in a business of such consequence, to put entire confidence in

them: that the French monarch was young, haughty, and powerful; and if

treated in so imperious a manner, would expose himself to the greatest

extremities rather than submit: that it was sufficient, if he could be

constrained to adhere to the offers which he himself had already made, and

if the remaining provinces of the Low Countries could be thereby saved

from the danger with which they were at present threatened: and that the

other powers in Germany and the north, whose assistance they might expect,

would be satisfied with putting a stop to the French conquests, without

pretending to recover the places already lost.

 

The English minister was content to accept of the terms proposed by the

pensionary. Lewis had offered to relinquish all the queen’s rights, on

condition either of keeping the conquests which he had made last campaign,

or of receiving, in lieu of them, Franche Compte, together with Cambray,

Aire, and St. Omers. De Wit and Temple founded their treaty upon this

proposal. They agreed to offer their mediation to the contending powers,

and oblige France to adhere to this alternative, and Spain to accept of

it. If Spain refused, they agreed that France should not prosecute her

claim by arms, but leave it entirely to England and Holland to employ

force for making the terms effectual. And the remainder of the Low

Countries they thenceforth guarantied to Spain. A defensive alliance was

likewise concluded between Holland and England.

 

The articles of this confederacy were soon adjusted by such candid and

able negotiators: but the greatest difficulty still remained. By the

constitution of the republic, all the towns in all the provinces must give

their consent to every alliance; and besides that this formality could not

be despatched in less than two months, it was justly to be dreaded that

the influence of France would obstruct the passing of the treaty in some

of the smaller cities. D’Estrades, the French ambassador, a man of

abilities, hearing of the league which was on the carpet, treated it

lightly. “Six weeks hence,” said he, “we shall speak to it.” To obviate

this difficulty, De Wit had the courage, for the public good, to break

through the laws in so fundamental an article; and by his authority, he

prevailed with the states general at once to sign and ratify the league:

though they acknowledged that, if that measure should displease their

constituents, they risked their heads by this irregularity. After sealing,

all parties embraced with great cordiality. Temple cried out, “At Breda,

as friends: here, as brothers.” And De Wit added, that now the matter was

finished, it looked like a miracle.

 

Room had been left in the treaty for the accession of Sweden, which was

soon after obtained; and thus was concluded in five days the triple

league; an event received with equal surprise and approbation by the

world. Notwithstanding the unfortunate conclusion of the last war, England

now appeared in her proper station, and, by this wise conduct, had

recovered all her influence and credit in Europe. Temple likewise received

great applause; but to all the compliments made him on the occasion, he

modestly replied, that to remove things from their centre, or proper

element, required force and labor; but that of themselves they easily

returned to it.

 

The French monarch was extremely displeased with this measure. Not only

bounds were at present set to his ambition; such a barrier was also raised

as seemed forever impregnable. And though his own offer was made the

foundation of the treaty, he had prescribed so short a time for the

acceptance of it that he still expected, from the delays and reluctance of

Spain, to find some opportunity of eluding it. The court of Madrid showed

equal displeasure. To relinquish any part of the Spanish provinces, in

lieu of claims so apparently unjust, and these urged with such violence

and haughtiness, inspired the highest disgust. Often did the Spaniards

threaten to abandon entirely the Low Countries, rather than submit to so

cruel a mortification; and they endeavored, by this menace, to terrify the

mediating powers into more vigorous measures for their support. But Temple

and De Wit were better acquainted with the views and interests of Spain.

They knew that she must still retain the Low Countries, as a bond of

connection with the other European powers, who alone, if her young monarch

should happen to die without issue, could insure her independency against

the pretensions of France. They still urged, therefore, the terms of the

triple league, and threatened Spain with war in case of refusal. The

plenipotentiaries of all the powers met at Aix-la-Chapelle. Temple was

minister for England; Van Beuninghen for Holland; D’Ohna for Sweden.

 

Spain at last, pressed on all hands, accepted of the alternative offered;

but in her very compliance, she gave strong symptoms of ill humor and

discontent. It had been apparent that the Hollanders, entirely neglecting

the honor of the Spanish monarchy, had been anxious only for their own

security; and, provided they could remove Lewis to a distance from their

frontier, were more indifferent what progress he made in other places.

Sensible of these views, the queen regent of Spain resolved still to keep

them in an anxiety, which might for the future be the foundation of a

union more intimate than they were willing at present to enter into

Franche Compte, by a vigorous and well-concerted plan of the French king,

had been conquered in fifteen days, during a rigorous season, and in the

midst of winter. She chose therefore to recover this province, and to

abandon all the towns conquered in Flanders during the last campaign. By

this means Lewis extended his garrisons into the heart of the Low

Countries; and a very feeble barrier remained to the Spanish provinces.

 

But notwithstanding the advantages of his situation, the French monarch

could entertain small hopes of ever extending his conquests on that

quarter, which lay the most exposed to his ambition, and where his

acquisitions were of most importance. The triple league guarantied the

remaining provinces to Spain; and the emperor and other powers of Germany,

whose interest seemed to be intimately concerned, were invited to enter

into the same confederacy. Spain herself, having about this time, under

the mediation of Charles, made peace on equal terms with Portugal, might

be expected to exert more vigor and opposition to her haughty and

triumphant rival. The great satisfaction expressed in England on account

of the counsels now embraced by the court, promised the hearty concurrence

of parliament in every measure which could be proposed for opposition to

the grandeur of France. And thus all Europe seemed to repose herself with

security under the wings of that powerful confederacy which had been so

happily formed for her protection. It is now time to give some account of

the state of affairs in Scotland and in Ireland.

 

The Scottish nation, though they had never been subject to the arbitrary

power of their prince, had but very imperfect notions of law and liberty;

and scarcely in any age had they ever enjoyed an administration which had

confined itself within the proper boundaries. By their final union alone

with England, their once hated adversary, they have happily attained the

experience of a government perfectly regular, and exempt from all violence

and injustice. Charles, from his aversion to business, had intrusted the

affairs of that country to his ministers, particularly Middleton; and

these could not forbear making very extraordinary stretches of authority.

 

There had been intercepted a letter, written by Lord Lorne to Lord Duffus,

in which, a little too plainly, but very truly, he complained, that his

enemies had endeavored by falsehood to prepossess the king against him.

But he said, that he had now discovered them, had defeated them, and had

gained the person, meaning the earl of Clarendon, upon whom the chief of

them depended. This letter was produced before the parliament; and Lorne

was tried upon an old, tyrannical, absurd law against leasing-making; by

which it was rendered criminal to belie the subjects to the king, or

create in him an ill opinion of them. He was condemned to die: but Charles

was much displeased with the sentence, and granted him a pardon.[*]

 

It was carried in parliament, that twelve persons, without crime, witness,

trial, or accuser, should be declared incapable of all trust or office;

and to render this injustice more egregious, it was agreed, that these

persons should be named by ballot; a method of voting which several

republics had adopted at elections, in order to prevent faction and

intrigue; but which could serve only as a cover to malice and iniquity in

the inflicting of punishments. Lauderdale, Crawford, and Sir Robert

Murray, among others, were incapacitated: but the king, who disapproved of

this injustice, refused his assent.[*]

 

An act was passed against all persons who should move the king for

restoring the children of those who were attainted by parliament; an

unheard-of restraint on applications for grace and mercy. No penalty was

affixed; but the act was but the more violent and tyrannical on that

account. The court lawyers had established it as a maxim, that the

assigning of a punishment was a limitation of the crown; whereas a law

forbidding any thing, though without a penalty, made the offenders

criminal. And in that case, they determined that the punishment was

arbitrary; only that it could not extend to life. Middleton, as

commissioner, passed this act; though he had no instructions for that

purpose.

 

An act of indemnity passed; but at the same time it was voted, that all

those who had offended during the late disorders, should be subjected to

fines; and a committee of parliament was appointed for imposing them.

These proceeded without any regard to some equitable rules which the king

had prescribed to them.[*] The most obnoxious compounded secretly.

 

No consideration was had, either of men’s riches, or of the degrees of

their guilt: no proofs were produced: inquiries were not so much as made:

but as fast as information was given in against any man, he was marked

down for a particular fine: and all was transacted in a secret committee.

When the list was read in parliament, exceptions were made to several:

some had been under age during the civil wars; some had been abroad. But

it was still replied, that a proper time would come when every man should

be heard in his own defence. The only intention, it was said, of setting

the fines was, that such persons should have no benefit by the act of

indemnity, unless they paid the sum demanded: every one that chose to

stand upon his innocence, and renounce the benefit of the indemnity, might

do it at his peril. It was well known, that no one would dare so far to

set at defiance so arbitrary an administration. The king wrote to the

council, ordering them to supersede the levying of those fines: but

Middleton found means, during some time, to elude these orders.[*] And at

last, the king obliged his ministers to compound for half the sums which

had been imposed. In all these transactions, and in most others which

passed during the present reign, we still find the moderating hand of the

king interposed to protect the Scots from the oppressions which their own

countrymen, employed in the ministry, were desirous of exercising over

them.

 

But the chief circumstance whence were derived all the subsequent tyranny

and disorders in Scotland, was the execution of the laws for the

establishment of Episcopacy; a mode of government to which a great part of

the nation had entertained an unsurmountable aversion. The rights of

patrons had for some years been abolished; and the power of electing

ministers had been vested in the kirk session and lay elders. It was now

enacted, that all incumbents who had been admitted upon this title, should

receive a presentation from the patron, and should be instituted anew by

the bishop, under the penalty of deprivation. The more rigid Presbyterians

concerted measures among themselves, and refused obedience: they imagined

that their number would protect them. Three hundred and fifty parishes,

above a third of the kingdom, were at once declared vacant. The western

counties chiefly were obstinate in this particular. New ministers were

sought for all over the kingdom; and no one was so ignorant or vicious as

to be rejected. The people, who loved extremely and respected their former

teachers; men remarkable for the severity of their manners, and their

fervor in preaching; were inflamed against these intruders, who had

obtained their livings under such invidious circumstances, and who took no

care, by the regularity of their manners, to soften the prejudices

entertained against them. Even most of those who retained their livings by

compliance, fell under the imputation of hypocrisy, either by their

showing a disgust to the new model of ecclesiastical government which they

had acknowledged; or, on the other hand, by declaring, that their former

adherence to Presbytery and the covenant had been the result of violence

and necessity. And as Middleton and the new ministry indulged themselves

in great riot and disorder, to which the nation had been little

accustomed, an opinion universally prevailed, that any form of religion,

offered by such hands, must be profane and impious.

 

The people, notwithstanding their discontents, were resolved to give no

handle against them, by the least symptom of mutiny or sedition: but this

submissive disposition, instead of procuring a mitigation of the rigors,

was made use of as an argument for continuing the same measures, which, by

their vigor, it was pretended, had produced so prompt an obedience. The

king, however, was disgusted with the violence of Middleton;[*] and he

made Rothes commissioner in his place. This nobleman was already president

of the council; and soon after was made lord keeper and treasurer.

Lauderdale still continued secretary of state, and commonly resided at

London.

 

Affairs remained in a peaceable state, till the severe law was made in

England against conventicles.[**] The Scottish parliament imitated that

violence, by passing a like act. A kind of high commission court was

appointed by the privy council, for executing this rigorous law, and for

the direction of ecclesiastical affairs. But even this court, illegal as

it might be deemed, was much preferable to the method next adopted.

Military force was let loose by the council. Wherever the people had

generally forsaken their churches, the guards were quartered throughout

the country. Sir James Turner commanded them, a man whose natural ferocity

of temper was often inflamed by the use of strong liquors. He went about,

and received from the clergy lists of those who absented themselves from

church, or were supposed to frequent conventicles. Without any proof or

legal conviction, he demanded a fine from them, and quartered soldiers on

the supposed delinquents, till he received payment. As an insurrection was

dreaded during the Dutch war, new forces were levied, and intrusted to the

command, of Dalziel and Drummond; two officers who had served the king

during the civil wars, and had afterwards engaged in the service of

Russia, where they had increased the native cruelty of their disposition.

A full career was given to their tyranny by the Scottish ministry.

Representations were made to the king against these enormities. He seemed

touched with the state of the country; and besides giving orders that the

ecclesiastical commission should be discontinued, he signified his

opinion, that another way of proceeding was necessary for his

service.[***]

 

This lenity of the king’s came too late to remedy the disorders. The

people, inflamed with bigotry, and irritated by ill usage, rose in arms.

They were instigated by Guthry, Semple, and other preachers. They

surprised Turner in Dumfries, and resolved to have put him to death; but

finding that his orders, which fell into their hands, were more violent

than his execution of them, they spared his life. At Laneric, after many

prayers, they renewed the covenant, and published their manifesto; in

which they professed all submission to the king: they desired only the

reÃ«stablishment of Presbytery, and of their former ministers. As many

gentlemen of their party had been confined on suspicion, Wallace and

Learmont, two officers who had served, but in no high rank, were intrusted

by the populace with the command. Their force never exceeded two thousand

men; and though the country in general bore them favor, men’s spirits were

so subdued, that the rebels could expect no further accession of numbers.

Dalziel took the field to oppose their progress. Their number was now

diminished to eight hundred; and these, having advanced near Edinburgh,

attempted to find their way back into the west by Pentland Hills. They

were attacked by the king’s forces.[*] Finding that they could not escape,

they stopped their march. Their clergy endeavored to infuse courage into

them. After singing some psalms, the rebels turned on the enemy; and being

assisted by the advantage of the ground, they received the first charge

very resolutely. But that was all the action: immediately they fell into

disorder, and fled for their lives. About forty were killed on the spot,

and a hundred and thirty taken prisoners. The rest, favored by the night,

and by the weariness, and even by the pity of the king’s troops, made

their escape.

 

The oppressions which these people had suffered, the delusions under which

they labored, and their inoffensive behavior during the insurrection, made

them the objects of compassion: yet were the king’s ministers,

particularly Sharpe, resolved to take severe vengeance. Ten were hanged on

one gibbet at Edinburgh; thirty-five before their own doors in different

places. These criminals might all have saved their lives, if they would

have renounced the covenant. The executions were going on, when the king

put a stop to them. He said, that blood enough had already been shed; and

he wrote a letter to the privy council, in which he ordered, that such of

the prisoners as should simply promise to obey the laws for the future,

should be set at liberty, and that the incorrigible should be sent to the

plantations.[*] This letter was brought by Burnet, archbishop of Glasgow;

but not being immediately delivered to the council by Sharpe, the

president,[**] one Maccail had in the interval been put to the torture,

under which he expired. He seemed to die in an ecstasy of joy. “Farewell,

sun, moon, and stars; farewell, world and time; farewell, weak and frail

body: welcome, eternity; welcome, angels and saints; welcome, Savior of

the world; and welcome, God, the Judge of all!” Such were his last words:

and these animated speeches he uttered with an accent and manner which

struck all the bystanders with astonishment.

 

The settlement of Ireland, after the restoration, was a work of greater

difficulty than that of England, or even of Scotland. Not only the power,

during the former usurpations, had there been vested in the king’s

enemies; the whole property, in a manner, of the kingdom had also been

changed: and it became necessary to redress, but with as little violence

as possible, many grievous hardships and iniquities which were there

complained of.

 

The Irish Catholics had in 1648 concluded a treaty with Ormond, the king’s

lieutenant; in which they had stipulated pardon for their past rebellion,

and had engaged, under certain conditions, to assist the royal cause: and

though the violence of the priests and the bigotry of the people had

prevented, in a great measure, the execution of this treaty, yet were

there many, who, having strictly, at the hazard of their lives, adhered to

it, seemed on that account well entitled to reap the fruits of their

loyalty. Cromwell, having without distinction expelled all the native

Irish from the three provinces of Munster, Leinster, and Ulster, had

confined them to Connaught and the county of Clare; and among those who

had thus been forfeited, were many whose innocence was altogether

unquestionable. Several Protestants likewise, and Ormond among the rest,

had all along opposed the Irish rebellion; yet having afterwards embraced

the king’s cause against the parliament, they were all of them attainted

by Cromwell. And there were many officers who had from the commencement of

the insurrection served in Ireland, and who, because they would not desert

the king, had been refused all their arrears by the English commonwealth.

 

To all these unhappy sufferers some justice seemed to be due: but the

difficulty was, to find the means of redressing such great and extensive

iniquities. Almost all the valuable parts of Ireland had been measured out

and divided, either to the adventurers, who had lent money to the

parliament for the suppression of the Irish rebellion, or to the soldiers,

who had received land in lieu of their arrears. These could not be

dispossessed, because they were the most powerful and only armed part of

Ireland; because it was requisite to favor them, in order to support the

Protestant and English interest in that kingdom; and because they had

generally, with a seeming zeal and alacrity, concurred in the king’s

restoration. The king, therefore, issued a proclamation, in which he

promised to maintain their settlement, and at the same time engaged to

give redress to the innocent sufferers. There was a quantity of land as

yet undivided in Ireland; and from this and some other funds, it was

thought possible for the king to fulfil both these engagements.

 

A court of claims was erected, consisting altogether of English

commissioners, who had no connection with any of the parties into which

Ireland was divided. Before these were laid four thousand claims of

persons craving restitution on account of their innocence; and the

commissioners had found leisure to examine only six hundred. It already

appeared, that if all these were to be restored, the funds, whence the

adventurers and soldiers must get reprisals, would fall short of giving

them any tolerable satisfaction. A great alarm and anxiety seized all

ranks of men: the hopes and fears of every party were excited: these

eagerly grasped at recovering their paternal inheritance; those were

resolute to maintain their new acquisitions.

 

The duke of Ormond was created lord lieutenant; being the only person

whose prudence and equity could compose such jarring interests. A

parliament was assembled at Dublin; and as the lower house was almost

entirely chosen by the soldiers and adventurers, who still kept

possession, it was extremely favorable to that interest. The house of

peers showed greater impartiality.

 

An insurrection was projected, together with a surprisal of the Castle of

Dublin, by some of the disbanded soldiers; but this design was happily

defeated by the vigilance of Ormond. Some of the criminals were punished.

Blood, the most desperate of them, escaped into England.

 

But affairs could not long remain in the confusion and uncertainty into

which they had fallen. All parties seemed willing to abate somewhat of

their pretensions, in order to attain some stability; and Ormond

interposed his authority for that purpose. The soldiers and adventurers

agreed to relinquish a third of their possessions; and as they had

purchased their lands at very low prices, they had reason to think

themselves favored by this composition. All those who had been attainted

on account of their adhering to the king, were restored; and some of the

innocent Irish. It was a hard situation that a man was obliged to prove

himself innocent, in order to recover possession of the estate which he

and his ancestors had ever enjoyed: but the hardship was augmented by the

difficult conditions annexed to this proof. If the person had ever lived

in the quarters of the rebels, he was not admitted to plead his innocence;

and he was, for that reason alone, supposed to have been a rebel. The

heinous guilt of the Irish nation made men the more readily overlook any

iniquity which might fall on individuals; and it was considered that,

though it be always the interest of all good governments to prevent

injustice, it is not always possible to remedy it, after it has had a long

course, and has been attended with great successes.

 

Ireland began to attain a state of some composure, when it was disturbed

by a violent act passed by the English parliament, which prohibited the

importation of Irish cattle into England.[*]

 

Ormond remonstrated strongly against this law. He said, that the present

trade carried on between England and Ireland was extremely to the

advantage of the former kingdom, which received only provisions or rude

materials in return for every species of manufacture: that if the cattle

of Ireland were prohibited, the inhabitants of that island had no other

commodity by which they could pay England for their importations, and must

have recourse to other nations for a supply: that the industrious

inhabitants of England, if deprived of Irish provisions, which made living

cheap, would be obliged to augment the price of labor, and thereby render

their manufactures too dear to be exported to foreign markets: that the

indolent inhabitants of Ireland, finding provisions fall almost to

nothing, would never be induced to labor, but would perpetuate to all

generations their native sloth and barbarism: that by cutting off almost

entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all the natural bands of union

were dissolved, and nothing remained to keep the Irish in their duty but

force and violence: and that by reducing that kingdom to extreme poverty,

it would be even rendered incapable of maintaining that military power, by

which, during its well-grounded discontents, it must necessarily be

retained in subjection.

 

The king was so much convinced of the justness of these reasons, that he

used all his interest to oppose the bill; and he openly declared, that he

could not give his assent to it with a safe conscience. But the commons

were resolute in their purpose. Some of the rents of England had fallen of

late years, which had been ascribed entirely to the importation of Irish

cattle: several intrigues had contributed to inflame that prejudice,

particularly those of Buckingham and Ashley, who were desirous of giving

Ormond disturbance in his government: and the spirit of tyranny, of which

nations are as susceptible as individuals, had extremely animated the

English to exert their superiority over their dependent state. No affair

could be conducted with greater violence than this was by the commons.

They even went so far, in the preamble of the bill, as to declare the

importation of Irish cattle to be a nuisance. By this expression they gave

scope to their passion, and at the same time barred the king’s

prerogative, by which he might think himself entitled to dispense with a

law so full of injustice and bad policy. The lords expunged the word; but

as the king was sensible that no supply would be given by the commons,

unless they were gratified in their prejudices, he was obliged both to

employ his interest with the peers for making the bill pass, and to give

the royal assent to it. He could not, however, forbear expressing his

displeasure at the jealousy entertained against him, and at the intention

which the commons discovered of retrenching his prerogative.

 

This law brought great distress for some time upon the Irish; but it has

occasioned their applying with greater industry to manufactures, and has

proved in the issue beneficial to that kingdom.
