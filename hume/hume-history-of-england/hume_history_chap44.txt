Though the dominion of the English over Ireland had been seemingly

established above four centuries, it may safely be affirmed, that their

authority had hitherto been little more than nominal. The Irish princes

and nobles, divided among themselves, readily paid the exterior marks of

obeisance to a power which they were not able to resist; but, as no

durable force was ever kept on foot to retain them in their duty, they

relapsed still into their former state of independence. Too weak to

introduce order and obedience among the rude inhabitants, the English

authority was yet sufficient to check the growth of any enterprising

genius among the natives: and though it could bestow no true form of civil

government, it was able to prevent the rise of any such form from the

internal combination or policy of the Irish.[*]

 

Most of the English institutions, likewise, by which that island was

governed, were to the last degree absurd, and such as no state before had

ever thought of, for preserving dominion over its conquered provinces.

 

The English nation, all on fire for the project of subduing France,—a

project whose success was the most improbable, and would to them have

proved the most pernicious,—neglected all other enterprises, to

which their situation so strongly invited them, and which, in time, would

have brought them an accession of riches, grandeur, and security. The

small army which they maintained in Ireland, they never supplied regularly

with pay; and as no money could be levied on the island, which possessed

none, they gave their soldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the

natives. Rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred which prevailed between

the conquerors and the conquered: want of security among the Irish,

introducing despair, nourished still more the sloth natural to that

uncultivated people.

 

But the English carried further their ill-judged tyranny, instead of

inviting the Irish to adopt the more civilized customs of their

conquerors, they even refused, though earnestly solicited, to communicate

to them the privilege of their laws and every where marked them out as

aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of the protection of justice, the

natives could find no security but in force; and flying the neighborhood

of cities, which they could not approach with safety, they sheltered

themselves in their marshes and forests from the insolence of their

inhuman masters. Being treated like wild beasts, they became such; and

joining the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity, they grew

every day more intractable and more dangerous.[*]

 

As the English princes deemed the conquest of the dispersed Irish to be

more the object of time and patience than the source of military glory,

they willingly delegated that office to private adventurers; who,

enlisting soldiers at their own charge, reduced provinces of that island,

which they converted to their own profit. Separate jurisdictions and

principalities were established by these lordly conquerors: the power of

peace and war was assumed: military law was exercised over the Irish whom

they subdued, and, by degrees, over the English by whose assistance they

conquered; and, after their authority had once taken root, deeming the

English institutions less favorable to barbarous dominion, they

degenerated into mere Irish, and abandoned the garb, language, manners,

and laws of their mother country.[**]

 

By all this imprudent conduct of England, the natives of its dependent

state remained still in that abject condition into which the northern and

western parts of Europe were sunk, before they received civility and

slavery from the refined policy and irresistible bravery of Rome. Even at

the end of the sixteenth century, when every Christian nation was

cultivating with ardor every civil art of life, that island, lying in a

temperate climate, enjoying a fertile soil, accessible in its situation,

possessed of innumerable harbors, was still, notwithstanding these

advantages, inhabited by a people whose customs and manners approached

nearer those of savages than of barbarians.[***]

 

As the rudeness and ignorance of the Irish were extreme they were sunk

below the reach of that curiosity and love of novelty by which every other

people in Europe had been seized at the beginning of that century, and

which had engaged them in innovations and religious disputes, with which

they were still so violently agitated. The ancient superstition, the

practices and observances of their fathers, mingled and polluted with many

wild opinions, still maintained an unshaken empire over them; and the

example alone of the English was sufficient to render the reformation

odious to the prejudiced and discontented Irish. The old opposition of

manners, laws, and interest was now inflamed by religious antipathy; and

the subduing and civilizing of that country seemed to become every day

more difficult and more impracticable.

 

The animosity against the English was carried so far by the Irish, that,

in an insurrection raised by two sons of the earl of Clanricarde, they put

to the sword all the inhabitants of the town of Athenry, though Irish,

because they began to conform themselves to English customs, and had

embraced a more civilized form of life than had been practised by their

ancestors.[*]

 

The usual revenue of Ireland amounted only to six thousand pounds a

year:[**] the queen, though with much repining,[***] commonly added twenty

thousand more, which she remitted from England; and with this small

revenue a body of a thousand men was supported, which, on extraordinary

emergencies, was augmented to two thousand.[****] No wonder that a force

so disproportioned to the object, instead of subduing a mutinous kingdom,

served rather to provoke the natives, and to excite those frequent

insurrections, which still further inflamed the animosity between the two

nations, and increased the disorders to which the Irish were naturally

subject.

 

In 1560, Shan O’Neale, or the great O’Neale, as the Irish called him,

because head of that potent clan, raised a rebellion in Ulster; but after

some skirmishes, he was received into favor, upon his submission, and his

promise of a more dutiful behavior for the future.[v]

 

This impunity tempted him to undertake a new insurrection in 1567; but

being pushed by Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, he retreated into

Clandeboy, and rather than submit to the English, he put himself into the

hands of some Scottish islanders, who commonly infested those parts by

their incursions. The Scots, who retained a quarrel against him on account

of former injuries, violated the laws of hospitality, and murdered him at

a festival to which they had invited him. He was a man equally noted for

his pride, his violence, his debaucheries, and his hatred of the English

nation. He is said to have put some of his followers to death because they

endeavored to introduce the use of bread after the English fashion.[*]

Though so violent an enemy to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot;

and was accustomed, after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever, to

plunge his body into mire, that he might allay the flame which he had

raised by former excesses.[**] Such was the life led by this haughty

barbarian; who scorned the title of the earl of Tyrone, which Elizabeth

intended to have restored to him, and who assumed the rank and appellation

of king of Ulster. He used also to say, that though the queen was his

sovereign lady, he never made peace with her but at her seeking.[***]

 

Sir Henry Sidney was one of the wisest and most active governors that

Ireland had enjoyed for several reigns;[****] and he possessed his

authority eleven years; during which he struggled with many difficulties,

and made some progress in repressing those disorders which had become

inveterate among the people. The earl of Desmond, in 1569, gave him

disturbance, from the hereditary animosity which prevailed between that

nobleman and the earl of Ormond, descended from the only family,

established in Ireland, that had steadily maintained its loyalty to the

English crown.[v] The earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted a rebellion in

Connaught, but was obliged to fly into France before his designs were ripe

for execution. Stukely, another fugitive, found such credit with the pope,

Gregory XIII., that he flattered that pontiff with the prospect of making

his nephew, Buon Compagno, king of Ireland; and, as if this project had

already taken effect, he accepted the title of marquis of Leinster from

the new sovereign.[v*] He passed next into Spain; and after having

received much encouragement and great rewards from Philip, who intended to

employ him as an instrument in disturbing Elizabeth, he was found to

possess too little interest for executing those high promises which he had

made to that monarch.

 

He retired into Portugal; and following the fortunes of Don Sebastian, he

perished with that gallant prince in his bold but unfortunate expedition

against the Moors.

 

Lord Gray, after some interval, succeeded to the government of Ireland;

and in 1579 suppressed a new rebellion of the earl of Desmond, though

supported by a body of Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks

followed a few years after; occasioned by the strict and equitable

administration of Sir Richard Bingham, governor of Connaught, who

endeavored to repress the tyranny of the chieftains over their vassals.[*]

The queen, finding Ireland so burdensome to her, tried several expediants

for reducing it to a state of greater order and submission. She encouraged

the earl of Essex, father to that nobleman who was afterwards her

favorite, to attempt the subduing and planting of Clandeboy, Ferny, and

other territories, part of some late forfeitures; but that enterprise

proved unfortunate; and Essex died of a distemper, occasioned, as is

supposed, by the vexation which he had conceived from his disappointments.

A university was founded in Dublin with a view of introducing arts and

learning into that kingdom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the

inhabitants.[**] But the most unhappy expedient employed in the government

of Ireland, was that made use of in 1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time

lord deputy; he put arms into the hands of the Irish inhabitants of

Ulster, in order to enable them, without the assistance of the government,

to repress the incursions of the Scottish islanders, by which these parts

were much infested.[***] At the same time, the invitations of Philip,

joined to their zeal for the Catholic religion, engaged many of the gentry

to serve in the Low Country wars, and thus Ireland, being provided with

officers and soldiers, with discipline and arms, became formidable to the

English, and was thenceforth able to maintain a more regular war against

her ancient masters.

 

Hugh O’Neale, nephew to Shan O’Neale, had been raised by the queen to the

dignity of earl of Tyrone; but having murdered his cousin, son of that

rebel, and being acknowledged head of his clan, he preferred the pride of

barbarous license and dominion to the pleasures of opulence and

tranquillity, and he fomented all those disorders by which he hoped to

weaken or overturn the English government. He was noted for the vices of

perfidy and cruelty, so common among uncultivated nations; and was also

eminent for courage, a virtue which their disorderly course of life

requires, and which, notwithstanding, being less supported by the

principle of honor, is commonly more precarious among them than among a

civilized people. Tyrone actuated by this spirit, secretly fomented the

discontents of the Maguires, O’Donnels, O’Rourks, Macmahons, and other

rebels; yet, trusting to the influence of his deceitful oaths and

professions, he put himself into the hands of Sir William Russel, who, in

the year 1594, was sent over deputy to Ireland. Contrary to the advice and

protestation of Sir Henry Bagnal, marshal of the army, he was dismissed;

and returning to his own country, he embraced the resolution of raising an

open rebellion, and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of

the English government. He entered into a correspondence with Spain; he

procured thence a supply of arms and ammunition; and having united all the

Irish chieftains in a dependence upon himself, he began to be regarded as

a formidable enemy.

 

The native Irish were so poor, that their country afforded few other

commodities than cattle and oatmeal, which were easily concealed or driven

away on the approach of the enemy; and as Elizabeth was averse to the

expense requisite for supporting her armies, the English found much

difficulty in pushing their advantages, and in pursuing the rebels into

the bogs, woods, and other fastnesses to which they retreated. These

motives rendered Sir John Norris, who commanded the English army, the more

willing to hearken to any proposals of truce or accommodation made him by

Tyrone; and after the war was spun out by these artifices for some years,

that gallant Englishman, finding that he had been deceived by treacherous

promises, and that he had performed nothing worthy of his ancient

reputation, was seized with a languishing distemper, and died of vexation

and discontent. Sir Henry Bagnal, who succeeded him in the command, was

still more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the fort of Black Water,

besieged by the rebels, he was surrounded in disadvantageous ground: his

soldiers, discouraged by part of their powders accidentally taking fire,

were put to flight; and, though the pursuit was stopped by Montacute, who

commanded the English horse, fifteen hundred men, together with the

general himself, were left dead upon the spot. This victory, so unusual to

the Irish, roused their courage, supplied them with arms and ammunition,

and raised the reputation of Tyrone, who assumed the character of the

deliverer of his country, and patron of Irish liberty.[*]

 

The English council were now sensible, that the rebellion of Ireland was

come to a dangerous head, and that the former temporizing arts, of

granting truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing them to

purchase pardons by resigning part of the plunder acquired during their

insurrection, served only to encourage the spirit of mutiny and disorder

among them. It was therefore resolved to push the war by more vigorous

measures; and the queen cast her eye on Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, as

a man, who, though hitherto less accustomed to arms than to books and

literature, was endowed, she thought, with talents equal to the

undertaking. But the young earl of Essex, ambitious of fame, and desirous

of obtaining this government for himself, opposed the choice of Mountjoy;

and represented the necessity of appointing for that important employment,

some person more experienced in war than this nobleman, more practised in

business, and of higher quality and reputation. By this description, he

was understood to mean himself;[**] and no sooner was his desire known,

than his enemies, even more zealously than his friends, conspired to

gratify his wishes. Many of his friends thought, that he never ought to

consent, except for a short time, to accept of any employment which must

remove him from court, and prevent him from cultivating that personal

inclination which the queen so visibly bore him.[***]

 

His enemies hoped, that if by his absence she had once leisure to forget

the charms of his person and conversation, his impatient and lofty

demeanor would soon disgust a princess who usually exacted such profound

submission and implicit obedience from all her servants. But Essex was

incapable of entering into such cautious views; and even Elizabeth, who

was extremely desirous of subduing the Irish rebels, and who was much

prepossessed in favor of Essex’s genius, readily agreed to appoint him

governor of Ireland, by the title of lord lieutenant. The more to

encourage him in his undertaking, she granted him by his patent more

extensive authority had ever before been conferred on any lieutenant; the

power of carrying on or finishing the war as he pleased, of pardoning the

rebels, and of filling all the most considerable employments of the

kingdom.[*] And to insure him of success, she levied a numerous army of

sixteen thousand foot and thirteen hundred horse, which she afterwards

augmented to twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse; a force which,

it was apprehended, would be able in one campaign to overwhelm the rebels,

and make an entire conquest of Ireland. Nor did Essex’s enemies, the earl

of Nottingham, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord Cobham,

throw any obstacles in the way of these preparations; but hoped that the

higher the queen’s expectations of success were raised, the more difficult

it would be for the event to correspond to them. In a like view, they

rather seconded than opposed those exalted encomiums, which Essex’s

numerous and sanguine friends dispersed, of his high genius, of his

elegant endowments, his heroic courage, his unbounded generosity, and his

noble birth; nor were they displeased to observe that passionate fondness

which the people every where expressed for this nobleman. These artful

politicians had studied his character; and finding that his open and

undaunted spirit, if taught temper and reserve from opposition, must

become invincible, they resolved rather to give full breath to those sails

which were already too much expanded and to push him upon dangers of which

he seemed to make such small account.[**] And the better to make advantage

of his indiscretions, spies were set upon all his actions, and even

expressions; and his vehement spirit, which, while he was in the midst of

the court and environed by his rivals, was unacquainted with disguise,

could not fail, after he thought himself surrounded by none but friends,

to give a pretence for malignant suspicions and constructions.

 

Essex left London in the month of March, attended with the acclamations of

the populace; and, what did him more honor, accompanied by a numerous

train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to his person, had

attached themselves to his fortunes, and sought fame and military

experience under so renowned a commander. The first act of authority which

he exercised after his arrival in Ireland, was an indiscretion, but of the

generous kind, and in both these respects suitable to his character. He

appointed his intimate friend the earl of Southampton, general of the

horse; a nobleman who had incurred the queen’s displeasure by secretly

marrying without her consent, and whom she had therefore enjoined Essex

not to employ in any command under him. She no sooner heard of this

instance of disobedience, than she reprimanded him, and ordered him to

recall his commission to Southampton. But Essex, who had imagined that

some reasons which he opposed to her first injunctions had satisfied her,

had the imprudence to remonstrate against these second orders;[*] and it

was not till she reiterated her commands that he could be prevailed on to

displace his friend.

 

Essex, on his landing at Dublin, deliberated with the Irish council

concerning the proper methods of carrying on the war against the rebels;

and here he was guilty of a capital error, which was the ruin of his

enterprise. He had always, while in England, blamed the conduct of former

commanders, who artfully protracted the war, who harassed their troops in

small enterprises, and who, by agreeing to truces and temporary

pacifications with the rebels, had given them leisure to recruit their

broken forces.[**] In conformity to these views, he had ever insisted upon

leading his forces immediately into Ulster against Tyrone, the chief

enemy; and his instructions had been drawn agreeably to these his declared

resolutions. But the Irish counsellors persuaded him that the season was

too early for the enterprise, and that as the morasses, in which the

northern Irish usually sheltered themselves, would not as yet be passable

to the English forces, it would be better to employ the present time in an

expedition into Munster. Their secret reason for this advice was, that

many of them possessed estates in that province, and were desirous to have

the enemy dislodged from their neighborhood;[***] but the same selfish

spirit which had induced them to give this counsel, made them soon after

disown it, when they found the bad consequences with which it was

attended.[****]

 

Essex obliged all the rebels of Munster either to submit or to fly into

the neighboring provinces: but as the Irish, from the greatness of the

queen’s preparations, had concluded that she intended to reduce them to

total subjection, or even utterly to exterminate them, they considered

their defence as a common cause; and the English forces were no sooner

withdrawn, than the inhabitants of Munster relapsed into rebellion, and

renewed their confederacy with their other countrymen. The army,

meanwhile, by the fatigue of long and tedious marches, and by the

influence of the climate, was become sickly; and on its return to Dublin,

about the middle of July, was surprisingly diminished in number. The

courage of the soldiers was even much abated: for though they had

prevailed in some lesser enterprises against Lord Cahir and others, yet

had they sometimes met with more stout resistance than they expected from

the Irish, whom they were wont to despise; and as they were raw troops and

unexperienced, a considerable body of them had been put to flight at the

Glins by an inferior number of the enemy. Essex was so enraged at this

misbehavior, that he cashiered all the officers, and decimated the private

men.[*] But this act of seventy, though necessary, had intimidated the

soldiers, and increased their aversion to the service.

 

The queen was extremely disgusted, when she heard that so considerable a

part of the season was consumed in these frivolous enterprises; and was

still more surprised, that Essex persevered in the same practice which he

had so much condemned in others, and which he knew to be so much contrary

to her purpose and intention. That nobleman, in order to give his troops

leisure to recruit from their sickness and fatigue, left the main army in

quarters, and marched with a small body of fifteen hundred men into the

county of Ophelie against the O’Connors and O’Mores, whom he forced to a

submission: but, on his return to Dublin, he found the army so much

diminished, that he wrote to the English council an account of its

condition, and informed them, that if he did not immediately receive a

reÃ«nforcement of two thousand men, it would be impossible for him this

season to attempt any thing against Tyrone. That there might be no

pretence for further inactivity, the queen immediately sent over the

number demanded;[**] and Essex began at last to assemble his forces for

the expedition into Ulster.

 

The army was so averse to this enterprise, and so terrified with the

reputation of Tyrone, that many of them counterfeited sickness, many of

them deserted;[*] and Essex found, that after leaving the necessary

garrisons, he could scarcely lead four thousand men against the rebels. He

marched, however, with this small army; but was soon sensible, that in so

advanced a season, it would be impossible for him to effect any thing

against an enemy who, though superior in number, was determined to avoid

every decisive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a message sent him by

Tyrone, who desired a conference; and a place near the two camps was

appointed for that purpose. The generals met without any of their

attendants; and a river ran between them, into which Tyrone entered to the

depth of his saddle; but Essex stood on the opposite bank. After half an

hour’s conference, where Tyrone behaved with great submission to the lord

lieutenant, a cessation of arms was concluded to the first of May,

renewable from six weeks to six weeks; but which might be broken off by

either party upon a fortnight’s warning.[**] Essex also received from

Tyrone proposals for a peace, in which that rebel had inserted many

unreasonable and exorbitant conditions: and there appeared afterwards some

reason to suspect that he had here commenced a very unjustifiable

correspondence with the enemy.[***]

 

So unexpected an issue of an enterprise, the greatest and most expensive

that Elizabeth had ever undertaken, provoked her extremely against Essex;

and this disgust was much augmented by other circumstances of that

nobleman’s conduct. He wrote many letters to the queen and council, full

of peevish and impatient expressions; complaining of his enemies,

lamenting that their calumnies should be believed against him, and

discovering symptoms of a mind equally haughty and discontented. She took

care to inform him of her dissatisfaction: but commanded him to remain in

Ireland till further orders.

 

Essex heard at once of Elizabeth’s anger, and of the promotion of his

enemy, Sir Robert Cecil, to the office of master of the wards, an office

to which he himself aspired: and dreading that, if he remained any longer

absent, the queen would be totally alienated from him, he hastily embraced

a resolution which, he knew, had once succeeded with the earl of

Leicester, the former favorite of Elizabeth. Leicester, being informed,

while in the Low Countries, that his mistress was extremely displeased

with his conduct, disobeyed her orders by coming over to England; and

having pacified her by his presence, by his apologies, and by his flattery

and insinuation, disappointed all the expectations of his enemies.[*]

Essex, therefore, weighing more the similarity of circumstances than the

difference of character between himself and Leicester, immediately set out

for England; and making speedy journeys, he arrived at court before any

one was in the least apprised of his intentions.[**] Though besmeared with

dirt and sweat, he hastened upstairs to the presence chamber, thence to

the privy chamber; nor stopped till he was in the queen’s bed-chamber, who

was newly risen, and was sitting with her hair about her face. He threw

himself on his knees, kissed her hand, and had some private conference

with her; where he was so graciously received, that on his departure he

was heard to express great satisfaction, and to thank God that, though he

had suffered much trouble and many storms abroad, he found a sweet calm at

home.[***]

 

But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the result of her surprise,

and of the momentary satisfaction which she felt on the sudden and

unexpected appearance of her favorite: after she had leisure for

recollection, all his faults recurred to her; and she thought it

necessary, by some severe discipline to subdue that haughty, imperious

spirit, who, presuming on her partiality, had pretended to domineer in her

councils, to engross all her favor, and to act, in the most important

affairs, without regard to her orders and instructions. When Essex waited

on her in the afternoon, he found her extremely altered in her carriage

towards him: she ordered him to be confined to his chamber; to be twice

examined by the council; and though his answers were calm and submissive,

she committed him to the custody of Lord Keeper Egerton, and held him

sequestered from all company, even from that of his countess, nor was so

much as the intercourse of letters permitted between them. Essex dropped

many expressions of humiliation and sorrow, none of resentment: he

professed an entire submission to the queen’s will; declared his intention

of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth a private life

remote from courts and business: but though he affected to be so entirely

cured of his aspiring ambition, the vexation of this disappointment, and

of the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon his haughty spirit, and

he fell into a distemper which seemed to put his life in danger.

 

The queen had always declared to all the world, and even to the earl

himself, that the purpose of her severity was to correct, not to ruin

him;[*] and when she heard of his sickness, she was not a little alarmed

with his situation. She ordered eight physicians of the best reputation

and experience to consult of his case; and being informed that the issue

was much to be apprehended, she sent Dr. James to him with some broth, and

desired that physician to deliver him a message, which she probably deemed

of still greater virtue, that if she thought such a step consistent with

her honor, she would herself pay him a visit. The bystanders, who

carefully observed her countenance, remarked, that in pronouncing these

words her eyes were suffused with tears.[**]

 

When these symptoms of the queen’s returning affection towards Essex were

known, they gave a sensible alarm to the faction which had declared their

opposition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh in particular, the most violent as

well as the most ambitious of his enemies, was so affected with the

appearance of this sudden revolution, that he was seized with sickness in

his turn; and the queen was obliged to apply the same salve to his wound,

and to send him a favorable message, expressing her desire of his

recovery.[***]

 

1600.

 

The medicine which the queen administered to these aspiring rivals was

successful with both; and Essex, being now allowed the company of his

countess, and having entertained more promising hopes of his future

fortunes, was so much restored in his health as to be thought past danger.

A belief was instilled into Elizabeth, that his distemper had been

entirely counterfeit, in order to move her compassion;[****] and she

relapsed into her former rigor against him. He wrote her a letter, and

sent her a rich present on new-year’s day, as was usual with the courtiers

at that time: she read the letter but rejected the present.[v] After some

interval, however, of severity, she allowed him to retire to his own

house; and though he remained still under custody, and was sequestered

from all company, he was so grateful for this mark of lenity, that he sent

her a letter of thanks on the occasion.

 

“This further degree of goodness,” said he, “doth sound in my ears, as if

your majesty spake these words: ‘Die not, Essex; for though I punish thine

offence, and humble thee for thy good yet will I one day be served again

by thee.’ My prostrate soul makes this answer: ‘I hope for that blessed

day.’ And in expectation of it, all my afflictions of body and mind are

humbly, patiently, and cheerfully borne by me.”[*] The countess of Essex,

daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, possessed, as well as her husband, a

refined taste in literature; and the chief consolation which Essex

enjoyed, during this period of anxiety and expectation, consisted in her

company, and in reading with her those instructive and entertaining

authors, which, even during the time of his greatest prosperity, he had

never entirely neglected.

 

There were several incidents which kept alive the queen’s anger against

Essex. Every account which she received from Ireland, convinced her more

and more of his misconduct in that government, and of the insignificant

purposes to which he had employed so much force and treasure. Tyrone, so

far from being quelled, had thought proper, in less than three months, to

break the truce, and joining with O’Donnel and other rebels, had overrun

almost the whole kingdom. He boasted that he was certain of receiving a

supply of men, money, and arms from Spain: he pretended to be champion of

the Catholic religion: and he openly exulted in the present of a phoenix

plume, which the pope, Clement VIII., in order to encourage him in the

prosecution of so good a cause, had consecrated, and had conferred upon

him.[**]

 

The queen, that she might check his progress, returned to her former

intention of appointing Mountjoy lord deputy; and though that nobleman,

who was an intimate friend of Essex, and desired his return to the

government of Ireland, did at first very earnestly excuse himself on

account of his bad state of health, she obliged him to accept of the

employment. Mountjoy found the island almost in a desperate condition; but

being a man of capacity and vigor, he was so little discouraged, that he

immediately advanced against Tyrone in Ulster. He penetrated into the

heart of that country, the chief seat of the rebels; he fortified Derry

and Mount-Norris, in order to bridle the Irish: he chased them from the

field, and obliged them to take shelter in the woods and morasses: he

employed, with equal success, Sir George Carew in Munster: and by these

promising enterprises, he gave new life to the queen’s authority in that

island.

 

As the comparison of Mountjoy’s administration with that of Essex

contributed to alienate Elizabeth from her favorite, she received

additional disgust from the partiality of the people, who, prepossessed

with an extravagant idea of Essex’s merit, complained of the injustice

done him by his removal from court, and by his confinement. Libels were

secretly dispersed against Cecil and Raleigh and all his enemies: and his

popularity, which was always great, seemed rather to be increased than

diminished by his misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to justify to the

public her conduct with regard to him, had often expressed her intentions

of having him tried in the star chamber for his offences: but her

tenderness for him prevailed at last over her severity; and she was

contented to have him only examined by the privy council. The

attorney-general, Coke, opened the cause against him, and treated him with

the cruelty and insolence which that great lawyer usually exercised

against the unfortunate. He displayed in the strongest colors all the

faults committed by Essex in his administration of Ireland: his making

Southampton general of the horse, contrary to the queen’s injunctions; his

deserting the enterprise against Tyrone, and marching to Leinster and

Munster, his conferring knighthood on too many persons; his secret

conference with Tyrone; and his sudden return from Ireland, in contempt of

her majesty’s commands. He also exaggerated the indignity of the

conditions which Tyrone had been allowed to propose; odious and abominable

conditions, said he; a public toleration of an idolatrous religion, pardon

for himself and every traitor in Ireland, and full restitution of lands

and possessions to all of them.[*] The solicitor-general, Fleming,

insisted upon the wretched situation in which the earl had left that

kingdom; and Francis, son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who had been lord keeper

in the beginning of the present reign, closed the charge with displaying

the undutiful expressions contained in some letters written by the earl.

 

Essex, when he came to plead in his own defence renounced, with great

submission and humility, all pretensions to an apology;[*] and declared

his resolution never, on this or any other occasion, to have any contest

with his sovereign. He said, that having severed himself from the world,

and abjured all sentiments of ambition, he had no scruple to confess every

failing or error into which his youth, folly, or manifold infirmities

might have betrayed him; that his inward sorrow for his offences against

her majesty was so profound, that it exceeded all his outward crosses and

afflictions, nor had he any scruple of submitting to a public confession

of whatever she had been pleased to impute to him; that in his

acknowledgments he retained only one reserve, which he never would

relinquish but with his life, the assertion of a loyal and unpolluted

heart, of an unfeigned affection, of an earnest desire ever to perform to

her majesty the best service which his pool abilities would permit; and

that, if this sentiment were allowed by the council, he willingly

acquiesced in any condemnation or sentence which they could pronounce

against him. This submission was uttered with so much eloquence, and in so

pathetic a manner, that it drew tears from many of the audience.[**] All

the privy counsellors, in giving their judgment, made no scruple of doing

the earl justice with regard to the loyalty of his intentions. Even Cecil,

whom he believed his capital enemy, treated him with regard and humanity.

And the sentence pronounced by the lord keeper, (to which the council

assented,) was in these words: “If this cause,” said he, “had been heard

in the star chamber, my sentence must have been for as great a fine as

ever was set upon any man’s head in that court, together with perpetual

confinement in that prison which belongeth to a man of his quality, the

Tower. But since we are now in another place, and in a course of favor, my

censure is, that the earl of Essex is not to execute the office of a

counsellor, nor that of earl marshal of England, nor of master of the

ordnance; and to return to his own house, there to continue a prisoner

till it shall please her majesty to release this and all the rest of his

sentence.”[***] The earl of Cumberland made a slight opposition to this

sentence; and said, that if he thought it would stand, he would have

required a little more time to deliberate; that he deemed it somewhat

severe; and that any commander-in-chief might easily incur a like penalty.

 

“But however,” added he, “in confidence of her majesty’s mercy, I agree

with the rest.” The earl of Worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of

Latin verses; importing, that where the gods are offended, even,

misfortunes ought to be imputed as crimes, and that accident is no excuse

for transgressions against the Divinity.

 

Bacon, so much distinguished afterwards by his high offices, and still

more by his profound genius for the sciences, was nearly allied to the

Cecil family, being nephew to Lord Burleigh, and cousin-german to the

secretary: but notwithstanding his extraordinary talents, he had met with

so little protection from his powerful relations, that he had not yet

obtained any preferment in the law, which was his profession. But Essex,

who could distinguish merit, and who passionately loved it, had entered

into an intimate friendship with Bacon; had zealously attempted, though

without success, to procure him the office of solicitor-general; and in

order to comfort his friend under the disappointment, had conferred on him

a present of land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds.[*] The public

could ill excuse Bacon’s appearance before the council against so

munificent a benefactor; though he acted in obedience to the queen’s

commands: but she was so well pleased with his behavior, that she imposed

on him a new task, of drawing a narrative of that day’s proceedings, in

order to satisfy the public of the justice and lenity of her conduct.

Bacon, who wanted firmness of character more than humanity, gave to the

whole transaction the most favorable turn for Essex; and, in particular,

painted out, in elaborate expression, the dutiful submission which that

nobleman discovered in the defence that he made for his conduct. When he

read the paper to her, she smiled at that passage, and observed to Bacon,

that old love, she saw, could not easily be forgotten. He replied, that he

hoped she meant that of herself.[**]

 

All the world, indeed, expected that Essex would soon be reinstated in his

former credit;[***] perhaps, as is usual in reconcilements founded on

inclination, would acquire an additional ascendant over the queen, and

after all his disgraces would again appear more a favorite than ever.

 

They were confirmed in this hope, when they saw that, though he was still

prohibited from appearing at court, he was continued in his office of

master of horse, and was restored to his liberty, and that all his friends

had access to him. Essex himself seemed determined to persevere in that

conduct which had hitherto been so successful, and which the queen, by all

this discipline, had endeavored to render habitual to him: he wrote to

her, that he kissed her majesty’s hands, and the rod with which she had

corrected him; but that he could never recover his wonted cheerfulness,

till she deigned to admit him to that presence which had ever been the

chief source of his happiness and enjoyment: and that he had now resolved

to make amends for his past errors, to retire into a country solitude, and

say with Nebucidnezzar, “Let my dwelling be with the beasts of the field;

let me eat grass as an ox, and be wet with the dew of heaven; till it

shall please the queen to restore me to my understanding.” The queen was

much pleased with these sentiments; and replied, that she heartily wished

his actions might correspond with his expressions; that he had tried her

patience a long time, and it was but fitting she should now make some

experiment of his submission; that her father would never have pardoned so

much obstinacy; but that, if the furnace of affliction produced such good

effects, she should ever after have the better opinion of her

chemistry.[*]

 

The earl of Essex possessed a monopoly of sweet wines; and as his patent

was near expiring, he patiently expected that the queen would renew it;

and he considered this event as the critical circumstance of his life,

which would determine whether he could ever hope to be reinstated in

credit and authority.[**] But Elizabeth, though gracious in her

deportment, was of a temper somewhat haughty and severe; and being

continually surrounded with Essex’s enemies, means were found to persuade

her, that his lofty spirit was not yet sufficiently subdued, and that he

must undergo this further trial, before he could again be safely received

into favor. She therefore denied his request; and even added, in a

contemptuous style, that an ungovernable beast must be stinted in his

provender.[***]

 

This rigor, pushed one step too far, proved the final ruin of this young

nobleman, and was the source of infinite sorrow and vexation to the queen

herself. Essex, who had with great difficulty so long subdued his proud

spirit, and whose patience was now exhausted, imagining that the queen was

entirely inexorable, burst at once all restraints of submission and of

prudence, and determined to seek relief by proceeding to the utmost

extremities against his enemies. Even during his greatest favor, he had

ever been accustomed to carry matters with a high hand towards his

sovereign, and as this practice gratified his own temper, and was

sometimes successful, he had imprudently imagined that it was the only

proper method of managing her: [*] but being now reduced to despair, he

gave entire reins to his violent disposition, and threw off all appearance

of duty and respect. Intoxicated with the public favor which he already

possessed, he practised anew every art of popularity; and endeavored to

increase the general good will by a hospitable manner of life, little

suited to his situation and circumstances. His former employments had

given him great connections, with men of the military profession; and he

now entertained, by additional caresses and civilities, a friendship with

all desperate adventurers, whose attachment, he hoped, might, in his

present views, prove serviceable to him. He secretly courted the

confidence of the Catholics; but his chief trust lay in the Puritans, whom

he openly caressed, and whose manners he seemed to have entirely adopted.

He engaged the most celebrated preachers of that sect to resort to Essex

House; he had daily prayers and sermons in his family; and he invited all

the zealots in London to attend those pious exercises. Such was the

disposition now beginning to prevail among the English, that, instead of

feasting and public spectacles, the methods anciently practised to gain

the populace, nothing so effectually ingratiated an ambitious leader with

the public as these fanatical entertainments. And as the Puritanical

preachers frequently inculcated in their sermons the doctrine of

resistance to the civil magistrate, they prepared the minds of their

hearers for those seditious projects which Essex was secretly

meditating.[**]

 

But the greatest imprudence of this nobleman proceeded from the openness

of his temper, by which he was ill qualified to succeed in such difficult,

and dangerous enterprises. He indulged himself in great liberties of

speech, and was even heard to say of the queen, that she was now grown an

old woman and was become as crooked in her mind as in her body.[*] Some

court ladies, whose favors Essex had formerly neglected, carried her these

stories, and incensed her to a high degree against him. Elizabeth was ever

remarkably jealous on this head; and though she was now approaching to her

seventieth year, she allowed her courtiers,[**] and even foreign

ambassadors,[***] to compliment her upon her beauty; nor had all her good

sense been able to cure her of this preposterous vanity.[****] 37
 

There was also an expedient employed by Essex, which, if possible, was

more provoking to the queen than those sarcasms on her age and deformity;

and that was, his secret applications to the king of Scots, her heir and

successor. That prince had this year very narrowly escaped a dangerous,

though ill-formed conspiracy of the earl of Gowry; and even his

deliverance was attended with this disagreeable circumstance, that the

obstinate ecclesiastics persisted, in spite of the most incontestable

evidence, to maintain to his face, that there had been no such conspiracy.

James, harassed with his turbulent and factious subjects, cast a wishful

eye to the succession of England; and in proportion as the queen advanced

in years, his desire increased of mounting that throne, on which, besides

acquiring a great addition of power and splendor, he hoped to govern a

people so much more tractable and submissive. He negotiated with all the

courts of Europe, in order to insure himself friends and partisans: he

even neglected not the court of Rome and that of Spain; and though he

engaged himself in no positive promise, he flattered the Catholics with

hopes that, in the event of his succession, they might expect some more

liberty than was at present indulged them. Elizabeth was the only

sovereign in Europe to whom he never dared to mention his right of

succession: he knew that, though her advanced age might now invite her to

think of fixing an heir to the crown, she never could bear the prospect of

her own death without horror, and was determined still to retain him, and

all other competitors, in an entire dependence upon her.

 

Essex was descended by females from the royal family and some of his

sanguine partisans had been so imprudent as to mention his name among

those of other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care, by means

of Henry Lee, whom he secretly sent into Scotland, to assure James, that

so far from entertaining such ambitious views, he was determined to use

every expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in favor of that

monarch’s right of succession. James willingly hearkened to this proposal,

but did not approve of the violent methods which Essex intended to employ.

Essex had communicated his scheme to Mountjoy, deputy of Ireland; and as

no man ever commanded more the cordial affection and attachment of his

friends, he had even engaged a person of that virtue and prudence to

entertain thoughts of bringing over part of his army into England, and of

forcing the queen to declare the king of Scots her successor.[*] And such

was Essex’s impatient ardor, that, though James declined this dangerous

expedient, he still endeavored to persuade Mountjoy not to desist from the

project; but the deputy, who thought that such violence, though it might

be prudent, and even justifiable, when supported by a sovereign prince,

next heir to the crown, would be rash and criminal if attempted by

subjects, absolutely refused his concurrence. The correspondence, however,

between Essex and the court of Scotland was still conducted with great

secrecy and cordiality; and that nobleman, besides conciliating the favor

of James, represented all his own adversaries as enemies to that prince’s

succession, and as men entirely devoted to the interests of Spain, and

partisans of the chimerical title of the infanta.

 

The infanta and the archduke Albert had made some advances to the queen

for peace; and Boulogne, as a neutral town, was chosen for the place of

conference. Sir Henry Nevil, the English resident in France, Herbert,

Edmondes, and Beale, were sent thither as ambassadors from England; and

negotiated with Zuniga, Carillo, Richetrdot, and Verheiken, ministers of

Spain and the archduke: but the conferences were soon broken off, by

disputes with regard to the ceremonial. Among the European states, England

had ever been allowed the precedency above Castile, Arragon, Portugal, and

the other kingdoms of which the Spanish monarchy was composed; and

Elizabeth insisted, that this ancient right was not lost on account of the

junction of these states, and that that monarchy in its present situation,

though it surpassed the English in extent as well as in power, could not

be compared with it in point of antiquity, the only durable and regular

foundation of precedency among kingdoms as well as noble families. That

she might show, however, a pacific disposition, she was content to yield

to an equality; but the Spanish ministers, as their nation had always

disputed precedency even with France, to which England yielded, would

proceed no further in the conference till their superiority of rank were

acknowledged.[*] During the preparations for this abortive negotiation,

the earl of Nottingham, the admiral, Lord Buckhurst, treasurer, and

Secretary Cecil, had discovered their inclination to peace, but as the

English nation, flushed with success, and sanguine in their hopes of

plunder and conquest, were in general averse to that measure, it was easy

for a person so popular as Essex to infuse into the multitude an opinion,

that these ministers had sacrificed the interests of their country to

Spain, and would even make no scruple of receiving a sovereign from that

hostile nation.

 

1601.

 

But Essex, not content with these arts for decrying his adversaries,

proceeded to concert more violent methods of ruining them; chiefly

instigated by Cuffe, his secretary, a man of a bold and arrogant spirit,

who had acquired a great ascendant over his patron. A select council of

malecontents was formed, who commonly met at Drury House, and were

composed of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the house belonged, the earl of

Southampton, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Christopher Blount, Sir John

Davies, and John Littleton; and Essex, who boasted that he had a hundred

and twenty barons, knights, and gentlemen of note at his devotion, and who

trusted still more to his authority with the populace, communicated to his

associates those secret designs with which his confidence in so powerful a

party had inspired him. Among other criminal projects, the result of blind

rage and despair, he deliberated with them concerning the method of taking

arms; and asked their opinion, whether he had best begin with seizing the

palace or the Tower, or set out with making himself master at once of both

places. The first enterprise being preferred, a method was concerted for

executing it. It was agreed, that Sir Christopher Blount, with a choice

detachment, should possess himself of the palace gates; that Davies should

seize the hall, Davers the guard chamber and presence chamber; and that

Essex should rush in from the Meuse, attended by a body of his partisans;

should entreat the queen, with all demonstrations of humility, to remove

his enemies; should oblige her to assemble a parliament; and should, with

common consent, settle a new plan of government.[*]

 

While these desperate projects were in agitation, many reasons of

suspicion were carried to the queen; and she sent Robert Sacville, son of

the treasurer, to Essex House, on pretence of a visit, but, in reality,

with a view of discovering whether there were in that place any unusual

concourse of people, or any extraordinary preparations which might

threaten an insurrection. Soon after, Essex received a summons to attend

the council, which met at the treasurer’s house; and while he was musing

on this circumstance, and comparing it with the late unexpected visit from

Sacville, a private note was conveyed to him, by which he was warned to

provide for his own safety. He concluded, that all his conspiracy was

discovered, at least suspected; and that the easiest punishment which he

had reason to apprehend, was a new and more severe confinement: he

therefore excused himself to the council on pretence of an indisposition;

and he immediately despatched messages to his more intimate confederates,

requesting their advice and assistance in the present critical situation

of his affairs. They deliberated, whether they should abandon all their

projects, and fly the kingdom; or instantly seize the palace with the

force which they could assemble; or rely upon the affections of the

citizens, who were generally known to have a great attachment to the earl.

Essex declared against the first expedient, and professed himself

determined to undergo any fate rather than submit to live the life of a

fugitive. To seize the palace seemed impracticable without more

preparations; especially as the queen seemed now aware of their projects,

and, as they heard, had used the precaution of doubling her ordinary

guards. There remained, therefore, no expedient but that of betaking

themselves to the city; and while the prudence and feasibility of this

resolution was under debate, a person arrived, who, as if he had received

a commission for the purpose, gave them assurance of the affections of the

Londoners, and affirmed that they might securely rest any project on that

foundation. The popularity of Essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his

vain undertakings; and he fondly imagined, that, with no other assistance

than the good will of the multitude, he might overturn Elizabeth’s

government, confirmed by time, revered for wisdom, supported by vigor, and

concurring with the general sentiments of the nation. The wild project of

raising the city was immediately resolved on; the execution of it was

decayed till next day; and emissaries were despatched to all Essex’s

friends, informing them that Cobham and Raleigh had laid schemes against

his life, and entreating their presence and assistance.

 

Next day, there appeared at Essex House the earls of Southampton and

Rutland, the lords Sandys and Monteagle, with about three hundred

gentlemen of good quality and fortune; and Essex informed them of the

danger to which, he pretended, the machinations of his enemies exposed

him. To some, he said that he would throw himself at the queen’s feet, and

crave her justice and protection; to others, he boasted of his interest in

the city, and affirmed that, whatever might happen, this resource could

never fail him. The queen was informed of these designs, by means of

intelligence conveyed, as is supposed, to Raleigh by Sir Ferdinando

Gorges; and having ordered the magistrates of London to keep the citizens

in readiness, she sent Egerton, lord keeper; to Essex House, with the earl

of Worcester, Sir William Knollys, comptroller, and Popham, chief justice,

in order to learn the cause of these unusual commotions. They were with

difficulty admitted through a wicket; but all their servants were

excluded, except the purse-bearer. After some altercation, in which they

charged Essex’s retainers, upon their allegiance, to lay down, their arms,

and were menaced in their turn by the angry multitude who surrounded them,

the earl, who found that matters were past recall, resolved to leave them

prisoners in his house, and to proceed to the execution of his former

project. He sallied forth with about two hundred attendants, armed only

with walking swords; and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl

of Bedford and Lord Cromwell He cried aloud, “For the queen! for the

queen! a plot is laid for my life;” and then proceeded to the house of

Smith the sheriff, on whose aid he had great reliance. The citizens

flocked about him in amazement; but though he told them that England was

sold to the infanta, and exhorted them to arms instantly otherwise they

could not do him any service, no one showed a disposition to join him. The

sheriff, on the earl’s approach to his house, stole out at the back door,

and made the best of his way to the mayor. Essex, meanwhile, observing the

coldness of the citizens, and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by

the earl of Cumberland and Lord Burleigh, began to despair of success, and

thought of retreating to his own house. He found the streets in his

passage barricaded and guarded by the citizens under the command of Sir

John Levison. In his attempt to force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman to

whom he bore great friendship, was killed, with two or three of the

Londoners; and the earl himself, attended by a few of his partisans, (for

the greater part began secretly to withdraw themselves,) retired towards

the river, and taking boat, arrived at Essex House. He there found that

Gorges, whom he had sent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the

other counsellors, had given all of them their liberty, and had gone to

court with them. He was now reduced to despair; and appeared determined,

in prosecution of Lord Sandy’s advice, to defend himself to the last

extremity, and rather to perish like a brave man, with his sword in his

hand, than basely by the hands of the executioner: but after some parley,

and after demanding in vain, first hostages, then conditions, from the

besiegers, he surrendered at discretion; requesting only civil treatment,

and a fair and impartial hearing.[*]

 

The queen, who, during all this commotion, had behaved with as great

tranquillity and security as if there had only passed a fray in the

streets, in which she was nowise concerned,[**] soon gave orders for the

trial of the most considerable of the criminals.

 

The earls of Essex and Southampton were arraigned before a jury of

twenty-five peers, where Buckhurst acted as lord steward. The guilt of the

prisoners was too apparent to admit of any doubt; and, besides the

insurrection known to every body, the treasonable conferences at Drury

House were proved by undoubted evidence. Sir Ferdinando Gorges was

produced in court: the confessions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords

Cromwell, Sandys, and Monteagle, of Davers, Blount, and Davies, were only

read to the peers, according to the practice of that age. Essex’s best

friends were scandalized at his assurance in insisting so positively on

his innocence, and the goodness of his intentions, and still more at his

vindictive disposition, in accusing, without any appearance of reason,

Secretary Cecil as a partisan of the infanta’s title. The secretary, who

had expected this charge, stepped into the court, and challenged Essex to

produce his authority, which, on examination, was found extremely weak and

frivolous.[*]

 

When sentence was pronounced, Essex spoke like a man who expected nothing

but death; but he added, that he should be sorry if he were represented to

the queen as a person that despised her clemency; though he should not, he

believed, make any cringing submissions to obtain it. Southampton’s

behavior was more mild and submissive; he entreated the good offices of

the peers in so modest and becoming a manner, as excited compassion in

every one.

 

The most remarkable circumstance in Essex’s trial was Bacon’s appearance

against him. He was none of the crown lawyers; so was not obliged by his

office to assist at this trial: yet did he not scruple, in order to obtain

the queen’s favor, to be active in bereaving of life his friend and

patron, whose generosity he had often experienced. He compared Essex’s

conduct, in pretending to fear the attempts of his adversaries, to that of

Pisistratus the Athenian, who cut and wounded his own body, and, making

the people believe that his enemies had committed the violence, obtained a

guard for his person, by whose assistance he afterwards subdued the

liberties of his country.

 

After Essex had passed some days in the solitude and reflections of a

prison, his proud heart was at last subdued, not by the fear of death, but

by the sentiments of religion; a principle which he had before attempted

to make the instrument of his ambition, but which now took a more firm

hold of his mind, and prevailed over every other motive and consideration.

His spiritual directors persuaded him, that he never could obtain the

pardon of Heaven, unless he made a full confession of his disloyalty; and

he gave in to the council an account of all his criminal design, as well

as of his correspondence with the king of Scots. He spared not even his

most intimate friends, such as Lord Mountjoy, whom he had engaged in these

conspiracies; and he sought to pacify his present remorse by making such

atonements as, in any other period of his life, he would have deemed more

blamable than those attempts themselves which were the objects of his

penitence.[*] Sir Henry Nevil, in particular, a man of merit, he accused

of a correspondence with the conspirators though it appears that this

gentleman had never assented to the proposals made him, and was no further

criminal than in not revealing the earl’s treason; an office to which

every man of honor naturally bears the strongest reluctance.[**] Nevil was

thrown into prison, and underwent a severe persecution but as the queen

found Mountjoy an able and successful commander, she continued him in his

government, and sacrificed her resentment to the public service.

 

Elizabeth affected extremely the praise of clemency; and in every great

example which she had made during her reign, she had always appeared full

of reluctance and hesitation: but the present situation of Essex called

forth all her tender affections, and kept her in the most real agitation

and irresolution. She felt a perpetual combat between resentment and

inclination, pride and compassion, the care of her own safety and concern

for her favorite; and her situation, during this interval, was perhaps

more an object of pity than that to which Essex himself was reduced. She

signed the warrant for his execution; she countermanded it; she again

resolved on his death; she felt a new return of tenderness. Essex’s

enemies told her, that he himself desired to die, and had assured her,

that she could never be in safety while he lived: it is likely that this

proof of penitence and of concern for her would produce a contrary effect

to what they intended, and would revive all the fond affection which she

had so long indulged towards the unhappy prisoner. But what chiefly

hardened her heart against him was his supposed obstinacy, in never

making, as she hourly expected, any application to her for mercy; and she

finally gave her consent to his execution. He discovered at his death

symptoms rather of penitence and piety than of fear; and willingly

acknowledged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered. The

execution was private in the Tower, agreeably to his own request. He was

apprehensive, he said, lest the favor and compassion of the people would

too much raise his heart in those moments, when humiliation under the

afflicting hand of Heaven was the only proper sentiment which he could

indulge.[***] And the queen no doubt, thought that prudence required the

removing of so melancholy a spectacle from the public eye.

 

Sir Walter Raleigh, who came to the Tower on purpose, and who beheld

Essex’s execution from a window, increased much by this action the general

hatred under which he already labored: it was thought, that his sole

intention was to feast his eyes with the death of an enemy; and no apology

which he could make for so ungenerous a conduct could be accepted by the

public. The cruelty and animosity with which he urged on Essex’s fate,

even when Cecil relented,[*] were still regarded as the principles of this

unmanly behavior.

 

The earl of Essex was but thirty-four years of age, when his rashness,

imprudence, and violence brought him to this untimely end. We must here,

as in many other instances, lament the inconstancy of human nature, that a

person endowed with so many noble virtues—generosity, sincerity,

friendship, valor, eloquence, and industry—should, in the latter

period of his life, have given reins to his ungovernable passions, and

involved, not only himself, but many of his friends, in utter ruin. The

queen’s tenderness and passion for him, as it was the cause of those

premature honors which he attained, seems, on the whole, the chief

circumstance which brought on his unhappy fate. Confident of her

partiality towards him, as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a

haughtiness which neither her love nor her dignity could bear; and as her

amorous inclinations, in so advanced an age, would naturally make her

appear ridiculous, if not odious, in his eyes, he was engaged, by an

imprudent openness, of which he made profession, to discover too easily

those sentiments to her. The many reconciliations and returns of

affection, of which he had still made advantage, induced him to venture on

new provocations, till he pushed her beyond all bounds of patience; and he

forgot, that though the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her,

those of the sovereign had still in the end appeared predominant.

 

Some of Essex’s associates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount, Meric, and Davies, were

tried and condemned, and all of these except Davies, were executed. The

queen pardoned the rest; being persuaded that they were drawn in merely

from their friendship to that nobleman, and their care of his safety, and

were ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions.

 

Southampton’s life was saved with great difficulty; but he was detained in

prison during the remainder of this reign.

 

The king of Scots, apprehensive lest his correspondence with Essex might

have been discovered, and have given offence to Elizabeth sent the earl of

Marre and Lord Kinloss as ambassadors to England, in order to congratulate

the queen on her escape from the late insurrection and conspiracy. They

were also ordered to make secret inquiry, whether any measures had been

taken by her for excluding him from the succession, as well as to discover

the inclinations of the chief nobility and counsellors, in case of the

queen’s demise.[*] They found the dispositions of men as favorable as they

could wish; and they even entered into a correspondence with Secretary

Cecil, whose influence, after the fall of Essex, was now uncontrolled,[**]

and who was resolved, by this policy, to acquire in time the confidence of

the successor. He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of her authority,

and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to James: but

he afterwards asserted, that nothing could be more advantageous to her

than this correspondence; because the king of Scots, secure of mounting

the throne by his undoubted title, aided by those connections with the

English ministry was the less likely to give any disturbance to the

present sovereign. He also persuaded that prince to remain in quiet, and

patiently to expect that time should open to him the inheritance of the

crown, without pushing his friends on desperate enterprises, which would

totally incapacitate them from serving him. James’s equity, as well as his

natural facility of disposition, easily inclined him to embrace that

resolution;[***] and in this manner the minds of the English were silently

but universally disposed to admit, without opposition, the succession of

the Scottish line: the death of Essex, by putting an end to faction, had

been rather favorable than prejudicial to that great event.

 

The French king, who was little prepossessed in favor of James, and who,

for obvious reasons, was averse to the union of England and

Scotland,[****] made his ambassador drop some hints to Cecil of Henry’s

willingness to concur in any measure for disappointing the hopes of the

Scottish monarch; but as Cecil showed an entire disapprobation of such

schemes.

 

The court of France took no further steps in that matter; and thus the

only foreign power which could give much disturbance to James’s

succession, was induced to acquiesce in it.[*]

 

Henry made a journey this summer to Calais; and the queen, hearing of his

intentions, went to Dover, in hopes of having a personal interview with a

monarch, whom, of all others, she most loved and most respected. The king

of France, who felt the same sentiments towards her, would gladly have

accepted of the proposal; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared

necessary to lay aside, by common consent, the project of an interview.

Elizabeth, however, wrote successively two letters to Henry, one by

Edmondes, another by Sir Robert Sidney; in which she expressed a desire of

conferring about a business of importance, with some minister in whom that

prince reposed entire confidence. The marquis of Rosni the king’s favorite

and prime minister, came to Dover in disguise; and the memoirs of that

able statesman contain a full account of his conference with Elizabeth.

This princess had formed a scheme for establishing, in conjunction with

Henry, a new system in Europe, and of fixing a durable balance of power,

by the erection of new states on the ruins of the house of Austria. She

had even the prudence to foresee the perils which might ensue from the

aggrandizement of her ally; and she purposed to unite all the seventeen

provinces of the Low Countries in one republic, in order to form a

perpetual barrier against the dangerous increase of the French as well as

of the Spanish monarchy. Henry had himself long meditated such a project

against the Austrian family; and Rosni could not forbear expressing his

astonishment, when he found that Elizabeth and his master, though they had

never communicated their sentiments on this subject, not only had entered

into the same general views, but had also formed the same plan for their

execution. The affairs, however, of France were not yet brought to a

situation which might enable Henry to begin that great enterprise; and

Rosni satisfied the queen that it would be necessary to postpone for some

years their united attack on the house of Austria. He departed, filled

with just admiration at the solidity of Elizabeth’s judgment, and the

greatness of her mind; and he owns, that she was entirely worthy of that

high reputation which she enjoyed in Europe.

 

The queen’s magnanimity in forming such extensive projects was the more

remarkable, as, besides her having fallen so far into the decline of life,

the affairs of Ireland, though conducted with abilities and success, were

still in disorder, and made a great diversion of her forces. The expense

incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues; and her

ministers, taking advantage of her disposition to frugality, proposed to

her an expedient of saving, which, though she at first disapproved of it,

she was at last induced to embrace. It was represented to her, that the

great sums of money remitted to Ireland for the pay of the English forces,

came, by the necessary course of circulation, into the hands of the

rebels, and enabled them to buy abroad all necessary supplies of arms and

ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty of that kingdom and its want

of every useful commodity, they could not otherwise find means to

purchase. It was therefore recommended to her, that she should pay her

forces in base money; and it was asserted that, besides the great saving

to the revenue, this species of coin could never be exported with

advantage, and would not pass in any foreign market. Some of her wiser

counsellors maintained, that if the pay of the soldiers were raised in

proportion, the Irish rebels would necessarily reap the same benefit from

the base money, which would always be taken at a rate suitable to its

value; if the pay were not raised, there would be danger of a mutiny among

the troops, who, whatever names might be affixed to the pieces of metal,

would soon find from experience that they were defrauded in their

income.[*] But Elizabeth, though she justly valued herself on fixing the

standard of the English coin, much debased by her predecessors, and had

innovated very little in that delicate article, was seduced by the

specious arguments employed by the treasurer on this occasion; and she

coined a great quantity of base money, which he made use of in the pay of

her forces in Ireland.[**]

 

Mountjoy, the deputy, was a man of abilities; and foreseeing the danger of

mutiny among the troops, he led them instantly into the field, and

resolved, by means of strict discipline, and by keeping them employed

against the enemy, to obviate those inconveniencies which were justly to

be apprehended. He made military roads, and built a fortress at Moghery;

he drove the Mac-Genises out of Lecale; he harassed Tyrone in Ulster with

inroads and lesser expeditions; and by destroying every where, and during

all seasons, the provisions of the Irish, he reduced them to perish by

famine in the woods and morasses, to which they were obliged to retreat.

At the same time, Sir Henry Docwray, who commanded another body of troops,

took the Castle of Derry, and put garrisons into Newton and Ainogh; and

having seized the monastery of Donnegal, near Balishannon, he threw troops

into it, and defended it against the assaults of O’Donnel and the Irish.

Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Munster. He seized the

titular earl of Desmond, and sent him over, with Florence Macarty, another

chieftain, prisoner to England. He arrested many suspected persons, and

took hostages from others. And having got a reÃ«nforcement of two thousand

men from England, he threw himself into Corke, which he supplied with arms

and provisions; and he put every thing in a condition for resisting the

Spanish invasion, which was daily expected. The deputy, informed of the

danger to which the southern provinces were exposed, left the prosecution

of the war against Tyrone, who was reduced to great extremities; and he

marched with his army into Munster.

 

At last the Spaniards, under Don John d’Aquila, arrived at Kinsale; and

Sir Richard Piercy, who commanded in the town with a small garrison of a

hundred and fifty men, found himself obliged to abandon it on their

appearance. These invaders amounted to four thousand men, and the Irish

discovered a strong propensity to join them, in order to free themselves

from the English government, with which they were extremely discontented.

One chief ground of their complaint, was the introduction of trials by

jury;[*] an institution abhorred by that people, though nothing

contributes more to the support of that equity and liberty for which the

English laws are so justly celebrated.

 

The Irish, also, bore a great favor to the Spaniards, having entertained

the opinion that they themselves were descended from that nation; and

their attachment to the Catholic religion proved a new cause of affection

to the invaders. D’Aquila assumed the title of general “in the holy war

for the preservation of the faith” in Ireland; and he endeavored to

persuade the people that Elizabeth was, by several bulls of the pope,

deprived of her crown; that her subjects were absolved from their oaths of

allegiance; and that the Spaniards were come to deliver the Irish from the

dominion of the devil.[*] Mountjoy found it necessary to act with vigor,

in order to prevent a total insurrection of the Irish; and having

collected his forces, he formed the siege of Kinsale by land, while Sir

Richard Levison, with a small squadron, blockaded it by sea. He had no

sooner begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of another body

of two thousand Spaniards under the command of Alphonso Ocampo, who had

taken possession of Baltimore and Berehaven; and he was obliged to detach

Sir George Carew to oppose their progress. Tyrone, meanwhile, with Randal,

Mac-Surley, Tirel, baron of Kelley, and other chieftains of the Irish, had

joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were marching to the relief of

Kinsale. The deputy, informed of their design by intercepted letters, made

preparations to receive them; and being reenforced by Levison with six

hundred marines, he posted his troops on an advantageous ground, which lay

on the passage of the enemy, leaving some cavalry to prevent a sally from

D’Aquila and the Spanish garrison. When Tyrone, with a detachment of Irish

and Spaniards, approached, he was surprised to find the English so well

posted, and ranged in good order, and he immediately sounded a retreat:

but the deputy gave orders to pursue him; and having thrown these advanced

troops into disorder, he followed them to the main body, whom he also

attacked and put to flight, with the slaughter of twelve hundred men.[**]

Ocampo was taken prisoner; Tyrone fled into Ulster; O’Donnel made his

escape into Spain; and D’Aquila, finding himself reduced to the greatest

difficulties, was obliged to capitulate upon such terms as the deputy

prescribed to him; he surrendered Kinsale and Baltimore, and agreed to

evacuate the kingdom. This great blow, joined to other successes gained by

Wlimot, governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin Harvey, threw the rebels

into dismay, and gave a prospect of the final reduction of Ireland.

 

The Irish war, though successful, was extremely burdensome on the queen’s

revenue; and besides the supplies granted by parliament, which were indeed

very small, but which they ever regarded as mighty concessions, she had

been obliged, notwithstanding her great frugality, to employ other

expedients, such as selling the royal demesnes and crown jewels,[***] and

exacting loans from the people,[****] in order to support this cause, so

essential to the honor and interests of England.

 

The necessity of her affairs obliged her again to summon a parliament; and

it here appeared, that though old age was advancing fast upon her, though

she had lost much of her popularity by the unfortunate execution of Essex,

insomuch that when she appeared in public she was not attended with the

usual acclamations,[*] yet the powers of her prerogative, supported by her

vigor, still remained as high and uncontrollable as ever.

 

The active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many persons to distinguish

themselves in civil and military employments; and the queen, who was not

able from her revenue to give them any rewards proportioned to their

services, had made use of an expedient which had been employed by her

predecessors, but which had never been carried to such an extreme as under

her administration. She granted her servants and courtiers patents for

monopolies; and these patents they sold to others, who were thereby

enabled to raise commodities to what price they pleased, and who put

invincible restraints upon all commerce, industry, and emulation in the

arts. It is astonishing to consider the number and importance of those

commodities which were thus assigned over to patentees. Currants, salt,

iron, powder, cards, calf-skins, fells, pouldavies, ox-shin-bones, train

oil, lists of cloth, potashes, aniseseeds, vinegar, seacoals, steel,

aquavitÃ¦, brushes, pots, bottles, saltpetre, lead, accidences, oil,

calamine stone, oil of blubber, glasses, paper, starch, tin, sulphur, new

drapery, dried pilchards, transportation of iron ordnance, of beer, of

horn, of leather, importation of Spanish wool, of Irish yarn: these are

but a part of the commodities which had been appropriated to

monopolists.[**] When this list was read in the house, a member cried, “Is

not bread in the number?” “Bread,” said every one with astonishment. “Yes,

I assure you,” replied he, “if affairs go on at this rate, we shall have

bread reduced to a monopoly before next parliament.” [***] These

monopolists were so exorbitant in their demands, that in some places they

raised the price of salt from sixteen pence a bushel, to fourteen or

fifteen shillings.[****]

 

Such high profits naturally begat intruders upon their commerce; and in

order to secure themselves against encroachments, the patentees were armed

with high and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they were

enabled to oppress the people at pleasure, and to exact money from such as

they thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent.[*] The

patentees of saltpetre, having the power of entering into every house, and

of committing what havoc they pleased in stables, cellars, or wherever

they suspected saltpetre might be gathered, commonly extorted money from

those who desired to free themselves from this damage or trouble.[**] And

while all domestic intercourse was thus restrained, lest any scope should

remain for industry, almost every species of foreign commerce was confined

to exclusive companies, who bought and sold at any price that they

themselves thought proper to offer or exact.

 

These grievances, the most intolerable for the present, and the most

pernicious in their consequences, that ever were known in any age or under

any government, had been mentioned in the last parliament, and a petition

had even been presented to the queen, complaining of the patents; but she

still persisted in defending her monopolists against her people. A bill

was now introduced into the lower house, abolishing all these monopolies;

and as the former application had been unsuccessful, a law was insisted on

as the only certain expedient for correcting these abuses. The courtiers,

on the other hand, maintained, that this matter regarded the prerogative,

and that the commons could never hope for success, if they did not make

application, in the most humble and respectful manner, to the queen’s

goodness and beneficence. The topics which were advanced in the house, and

which came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen, and were

admitted by both, will appear the most extraordinary to such as are

prepossessed with an idea of the privileges enjoyed by the people during

that age, and of the liberty possessed under the administration of

Elizabeth. It was asserted that the queen inherited both an enlarging and

a restraining power; by her prerogative she might set at liberty what was

restrained by statute or otherwise, and by her prerogative she might

restrain what was otherwise at liberty:[***] that the royal prerogative

was not to be canvassed, nor disputed, nor examined;[****] and did not

even admit of any limitation.[v]

 

That absolute princes, such as the sovereigns of England, were a species

of divinity;[*] that it was in vain to attempt tying the queen’s hands by

laws or statutes; since, by means of her dispensing power, she could

loosen herself at pleasure:[**] and that even if a clause should be

annexed to a statute, excluding her dispensing power, she could first

dispense with that clause and then with the statute.[***] After all this

discourse, more worthy of a Turkish divan than of an English house of

commons, according to our present idea of this assembly, the queen, who

perceived how odious monopolies had become, and what heats were likely to

arise, sent for the speaker, and desired him to acquaint the house, that

she would immediately cancel the most grievous and oppressive of these

patents.[****] 38
 

The house was struck with astonishment, and admiration and gratitude, at

this extraordinary instance of the queen’s goodness and condescension. A

member said, with tears in his eyes, that if a sentence of everlasting

happiness had been pronounced in his favor, he could not have felt more

joy than that with which he was at present over whelmed.[v] Another

observed, that this message from the sacred person of the queen was a kind

of gospel or glad tidings, and ought to be received as such, and be

written in the tablets of their hearts.[v*] And it was further remarked,

that in the same manner as the Deity would not give his glory to another,

so the queen herself was the only agent in their present prosperity and

happiness.[v**] The house voted, that the speaker, with a committee,

should ask permission to wait on her majesty, and return thanks to her for

her gracious concessions to her people.

 

When the speaker, with the other members, was introduced to the queen,

they all flung themselves on their knees, and remained in that posture a

considerable time, till she thought proper to express her desire that they

should rise.[v***]

 

The speaker displayed the gratitude of the commons, because her sacred

ears were ever open to hear them, and her blessed hands ever stretched out

to relieve them. They acknowledged, he said, in all duty and thankfulness

acknowledged, that, before they called, her “preventing grace” and

“all-deserving goodness” watched over them for their good; more ready to

give than they could desire, much less deserve. He remarked, that the

attribute which was most proper to God, to perform all he promiseth,

appertained also to her; and that she was all truth, all constancy, and

all goodness. And he concluded with these expressions: “Neither do we

present our thanks in words or any outward sign, which can be no

sufficient retribution for so great goodness; but in all duty and

thankfulness, prostrate at your feet, we present our most loyal and

thankful hearts, even the last drop of blood in our hearts, and the last

spirit of breath in our nostrils, to be poured out, to be breathed up, for

your safety.” [*]

 

The queen heard very patiently this speech, in which she was flattered in

phrases appropriated to the Supreme Being; and she returned an answer full

of such expressions of tenderness towards her people, as ought to have

appeared fulsome after the late instances of rigor which she had employed,

and from which nothing but necessity had made her depart. Thus was this

critical affair happily terminated; and Elizabeth, by prudently receding,

in time, from part of her prerogative, maintained her dignity, and

preserved the affections of her people.

 

The commons granted her a supply quite unprecedented, of four subsidies

and eight fifteenths; and they were so dutiful as to vote this supply

before they received any satisfaction in the business of monopolies, which

they justly considered as of the utmost importance to the interest and

happiness of the nation. Had they attempted to extort that concession by

keeping the supply in suspense, so haughty was the queen’s disposition,

that this appearance of constraint and jealousy had been sufficient to

have produced a denial of all their requests, and to have forced her into

some acts of authority still more violent and arbitrary.

 

1602.

 

The remaining events of this reign are neither numerous nor important. The

queen, finding that the Spaniards had involved her in so much trouble, by

fomenting and assisting the Irish rebellion, resolved to give them

employment at home; and she fitted out a squadron of nine ships, under Sir

Richard Levison, admiral, and Sir William Monson, vice-admiral, whom she

sent on an expedition to the coast of Spain. The admiral, with part of the

squadron, met the galleons loaded with treasure; but was not strong enough

to attack them. The vice-admiral also fell in with some rich ships, but

they escaped for a like reason; and these two brave officers, that their

expedition might not prove entirely fruitless, resolved to attack the

harbor of Cerimbra, in Portugal; where, they received intelligence, a very

rich carrack had taken shelter. The harbor was guarded by a castle: there

were eleven galleys stationed in it; and the militia of the country, to

the number, as was believed, of twenty thousand men, appeared in arms on

the shore: yet, notwithstanding these obstacles, and others derived from

the winds and tides, the English squadron broke into the harbor,

dismounted the guns of the castle, sunk, or burnt, or put to flight the

galleys, and obliged the carrack to surrender.[*] They brought her home to

England, and she was valued at a million of ducats:[**] a sensible loss to

the Spaniards, and a supply still more important to Elizabeth.[***]

 

The affairs of Ireland, after the defeat of Tyrone and the expulsion of

the Spaniards, hastened to a settlement. Lord Mountjoy divided his army

into small parties, and harassed the rebels on every side: he built

Charlemont and many other small forts, which were impregnable to the

Irish, and guarded all the important passes of the country: the activity

of Sir Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chichester permitted no repose or

security to the rebels; and many of the chieftains, after skulking during

some time in woods and morasses, submitted to mercy, and received such

conditions as the deputy was pleased to impose upon them.

 

1603.

 

Tyrone himself made application by Arthur Mac-Baron, his brother, to be

received upon terms; but Mountjoy would not admit him, except he made an

absolute surrender of his life and fortunes to the queen’s mercy. He

appeared before the deputy at Millefont, in a habit and posture suitable

to his present fortune; and after acknowledging his offence in the most

humble terms, he was committed to custody by Mountjoy, who intended to

bring him over captive into England, to be disposed of at the queen’s

pleasure.

 

But Elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any satisfaction from this

fortunate event: she had fallen into a profound melancholy; which all the

advantages of her high fortune, all the glories of her prosperous reign,

were unable in any degree to alleviate or assuage. Some ascribed this

depression of mind to her repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone, whom

she had always resolved to bring to condign punishment for his treasons,

but who had made such interest with the ministers as to extort a remission

from her. Others, with more likelihood, accounted for her dejection by a

discovery which she had made, of the correspondence maintained in her

court with her successor, the king of Scots, and by the neglect to which,

on account of her old age and infirmities, she imagined herself to be

exposed. But there is another cause assigned for her melancholy, which has

long been rejected by historians as romantic, but which late discoveries

seem to have confirmed:[*] some incidents happened which revived her

tenderness for Essex, and filled her with the deepest sorrow for the

consent which she had unwarily given to his execution.

 

The earl of Essex, after his return from the fortunate expedition against

Cadiz, observing the increase of the queen’s fond attachment towards him,

took occasion to regret, that the necessity of her service required him

often to be absent from her person, and exposed him to all those ill

offices which his enemies, more assiduous in their attendance, could

employ against him. She was moved with this tender jealousy; and making

him the present of a ring, desired him to keep that pledge of her

affection, and assured him, that into whatever disgrace he should fall,

whatever prejudices she might be induced to entertain against him, yet, if

he sent her that ring, she would immediately upon the sight of it recall

her former tenderness, would afford him a patient hearing, and would lend

a favorable ear to his apology. Essex, notwithstanding all his

misfortunes, reserved this precious gift to the last extremity; but after

his trial and condemnation, he resolved to try the experiment, and he

committed the ring to the countess of Nottingham, whom he desired to

deliver it to the queen. The countess was prevailed on by her husband, the

mortal enemy of Essex, not to execute the commission; and Elizabeth, who

still expected that her favorite would make this last appeal to her

tenderness, and who ascribed the neglect of it to his invincible

obstinacy, was, after much delay and many internal combats, pushed by

resentment and policy to sign the warrant for his execution. The countess

of Nottingham, falling into sickness, and affected with the near approach

of death, was seized with remorse for her conduct; and having obtained a

visit from the queen, she craved her pardon, and revealed to her the fatal

secret. The queen, astonished with this incident, burst into a furious

passion: she shook the dying countess in her bed; and crying to her, “that

God might pardon her, but she never could,” she broke from her, and

thenceforth resigned herself over to the deepest and most incurable

melancholy. She rejected all consolation: she even refused food and

sustenance: and throwing herself on the floor, she remained sullen and

immovable, feeding her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life and

existence an insufferable burden to her. Few words she uttered; and they

were all expressive of some inward grief which she cared not to reveal:

but sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to her

despondency, and which, though they discovered her sorrows, were never

able to ease or assuage them. Ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet,

leaning on cushions which her maids brought her; and her physicians could

not persuade her to allow herself to be put to bed, much less to make

trial of any remedies which they prescribed to her.[*]

 

Her anxious mind at last had so long preyed on her frail body, that her

end was visibly approaching; and the council, being assembled, sent the

keeper, admiral, and secretary, to know her will with regard to her

successor. She answered with a faint voice, that as she had held a regal

sceptre, she desired no other than a royal successor. Cecil requesting her

to explain herself more particularly, she subjoined, that she would have a

king to succeed her; and who should that be but her nearest kinsman, the

king of Scots? Being then advised by the archbishop of Canterbury to fix

her thoughts upon God, she replied, that she did so, nor did her mind in

the least wander from him. Her voice soon after left her and senses

failed; she fell into a lethargic slumber, which continued some hours; and

she expired gently, without further struggle or convulsion, in the

seventieth year of her age, and forty-fifth of her reign.

 

So dark a cloud overcast the evening of that day which had shone out with

a mighty lustre in the eyes of all Europe. There are few great personages

in history who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies and the

adulation of friends than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there scarcely is any

whose reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous

consent of posterity. The unusual length of her administration, and the

strong features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices;

and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her

admirers somewhat of their panegyrics, have at last, in spite of political

factions and, what is more, of religious animosities, produced a uniform

judgment with regard to her conduct. Her vigor, her constancy, her

magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed to merit the

highest praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any person that

ever filled a throne: a conduct less rigorous, less imperious, more

sincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requisite to form a

perfect character. By the force of her mind, she controlled all her more

active and stronger qualities, and prevented them from running into

excess: her heroism was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice,

her friendship from partiality, her active temper from turbulency and a

vain ambition; she guarded not herself with equal care or equal success

from lesser infirmities; the rivalship of beauty, the desire of

admiration, the jealousy of love, and the sallies of anger.

 

Her singular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and

on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herself, she soon

obtained an uncontrolled ascendant over her people; and while she merited

all their esteem by her real virtues, she also engaged their affections by

her pretended ones. Few sovereigns of England succeeded to the throne in

more difficult circumstances; and none ever conducted the government with

such uniform success and felicity. Though unacquainted with the practice

of toleration, the true secret for managing religious factions, she

preserved her people, by her superior prudence, from those confusions in

which theological controversy had involved all the neighboring nations:

and though her enemies were the most powerful princes of Europe, the most

active, the most enterprising, the least scrupulous, she was able by her

vigor to make deep impressions on their states; her own greatness,

meanwhile, remained untouched and unimpaired.

 

The wise ministers and brave warriors who flourished under her reign,

share the praise of her success; but instead of lessening the applause due

to her, they make great addition to it. They owed all of them their

advancement to her choice; they were supported by her constancy; and, with

all their abilities, they were never able to acquire any undue ascendant

over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, she remained

equally mistress: the force of the tender passions was great over her, but

the force of her mind was still superior; and the combat which her victory

visibly cost her, serves only to display the firmness of her resolution,

and the loftiness of her ambitious sentiments.

 

The fame of this princess, though it has surmounted the prejudices both of

faction and bigotry, yet lies still exposed to another prejudice, which is

more durable because more natural, and which, according to the different

views in which we survey her, is capable either of exalting beyond

measure, or diminishing the lustre of her character. This prejudice is

founded on the consideration of her sex. When we contemplate her as a

woman, we are apt to be struck with the highest admiration of her great

qualities and extensive capacity; but we are also apt to require some more

softness of disposition, some greater lenity of temper, some of those

amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished. But the true method

of estimating her merit, is to lay aside all these considerations, and

consider her merely as a rational being placed in authority, and intrusted

with the government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our

fancy to her as a wife or a mistress; but her qualities as a sovereign,

though with some considerable exceptions, are the object of undisputed

applause and approbation.

 

 
 

The party among us who have distinguished themselves by their adhering to

liberty and a popular government, have long indulged their prejudices

against the succeeding race of princes, by bestowing unbounded panegyrics

on the virtue and wisdom of Elizabeth. They have even been so extremely

ignorant of the transactions of this reign, as to extol her for a quality

which, of all others, she was the least possessed of; a tender regard for

the constitution, and a concern for the liberties and privileges of her

people. But as it is scarcely possible for the prepossessions of party to

throw a veil much longer over facts so palpable and undeniable, there is

danger lest the public should run into the opposite extreme, and should

entertain an aversion to the memory of a princess who exercised the royal

authority in a manner so contrary to all the ideas which we at present

entertain of a legal constitution. But Elizabeth only supported the

prerogatives transmitted to her by her predecessors: she believed that her

subjects were entitled to no more liberty than their ancestors had

enjoyed: she found that they entirely acquiesced in her arbitrary

administration: and it was not natural for her to find fault with a form

of government by which she herself was invested with such unlimited

authority. In the particular exertions of power, the question ought never

to be forgotten, What is best? But in the general distribution of power

among the several members of a constitution, there can seldom be admitted

any other question than, What is established? Few examples occur of

princes who have willingly resigned their power; none of those who have,

without struggle and reluctance, allowed it to be extorted from them. If

any other rule than established practice be followed, factions and

dissensions must multiply without end: and though many constitutions, and

none more than the British, have been improved even by violent

innovations, the praise bestowed on those patriots to whom the nation has

been indebted for its privileges, ought to be given with some reserve, and

surely without the least rancor against those who adhered to the ancient

constitution.[*]

 

In order to understand the ancient constitution of England, there is not a

period which deserves more to be studied than the reign of Elizabeth. The

prerogatives of this princess were scarcely ever disputed, and she

therefore employed them without scruple: her imperious temper—a

circumstance in which she went far beyond her successors—rendered

her exertions of power violent and frequent, and discovered the full

extent of her authority: the great popularity which she enjoyed, proves

that she did not infringe any established liberties of the people: there

remains evidence sufficient to ascertain the most noted acts of her

administration: and though that evidence must be drawn from a source wide

of the ordinary historians, it becomes only the more authentic on that

account, and serves as a stronger proof, that her particular exertions of

power were conceived to be nothing but the ordinary course of

administration, since they were not thought remarkable enough to be

recorded even by contemporary writers. If there was any difference in this

particular, the people in former reigns seem rather to have been more

submissive than even during the age of Elizabeth;[**] it may not here be

improper to recount some of the ancient prerogatives of the crown, and lay

open the sources of that great power which the English monarchs formerly

enjoyed.

 

One of the most ancient and most established instruments of power was the

court of star chamber, which possessed an unlimited discretionary

authority of fining, imprisoning, and inflicting corporal punishment; and

whose jurisdiction extended to all sorts of offences, contempts, and

disorders that lay not within reach of the common law. The members of this

court consisted of the privy council and the judges; men who all of them

enjoyed their offices during pleasure; and when the prince himself was

present, he was the sole judge, and all the others could only interpose

with their advice. There needed but this one court in any government to

put an end to all regular, legal, and exact plans of liberty; for who

durst set himself in opposition to the crown and ministry, or aspire to

the character of being a patron of freedom, while exposed to so arbitrary

a jurisdiction? I much question whether any of the absolute monarchies in

Europe contain, at present, so illegal and despotic a tribunal.

 

The court of high commission was another jurisdiction still more terrible;

both because the crime of heresy, of which it took cognizance, was more

undefinable than any civil offence, and because its methods of

inquisition, and of administering oaths, were more contrary to all the

most simple ideas of justice and equity. The fines and imprisonments

imposed by this court were frequent: the deprivations and suspensions of

the clergy for nonconformity were also numerous, and comprehended at one

time the third of all the ecclesiastics of England.[*] The queen, in a

letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, said expressly, that she was

resolved “that no man should be suffered to decline, either on the left or

on the right hand, from the drawn line limited by authority, and by her

laws and injunctions.”[**]

 

But martial law went beyond even these two courts in a prompt, and

arbitrary, and violent method of decision. Whenever there was any

insurrection or public disorder, the crown employed martial law; and it

was, during that time, exercised not only over the soldiers, but over the

whole people; any one might be punished as a rebel, or an aider and

abettor of rebellion, whom the provost martial, or lieutenant of a county,

or their deputies, pleased to suspect. Lord Bacon says, that the trial at

common law granted to the earl of Essex and his fellow-conspirators, was a

favor; for that the case would have borne and required the severity of

martial law.[***]

 

We have seen instances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of

orthodoxy. There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth’s to the earl of

Sussex, after the suppression of the northern rebellion, in which she

sharply reproves him, because she had not heard of his having executed any

criminals by martial law;[*] though it is probable that near eight hundred

persons suffered, one way or other, on account of that slight

insurrection. But the kings of England did not always limit the exercise

of this law to times of civil war and disorder. In 1552, when there was no

rebellion or insurrection, King Edward granted a commission of martial

law; and empowered the commissioners to execute it, “as should be thought

by their discretions most necessary.”[**] Queen Elizabeth too was not

sparing in the use of this law. In 1573, one Peter Burchet, a Puritan,

being persuaded that it was meritorious to kill such as opposed the truth

of the gospel, ran into the streets, and wounded Hawkins, the famous sea

captain, whom he took for Hatton, the queen’s favorite. The queen was so

incensed, that she ordered him to be punished instantly by martial law;

but upon the remonstrance of some prudent counsellors, who told her that

this law was usually confined to turbulent times, she recalled her order,

and delivered over Burchet to the common law.[***] But she continued not

always so reserved in executing this authority. There remains a

proclamation of hers, in which she orders martial law to be used against

all such as import bulls, or even forbidden books and pamphlets from

abroad;[****] and prohibits the questioning of the lieutenants or their

deputies for their arbitrary punishment of such offenders, “any law or

statute to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.”

 

We have another act of hers still more extraordinary. The streets of

London were much infested with idle vagabonds and riotous persons: the

lord mayor had endeavored to repress this disorder: the star chamber had

exerted its authority, and inflicted punishment on these rioters: but the

queen, finding those remedies ineffectual, revived martial law, and gave

Sir Thomas Wilford a commission of provost-martial: “Granting him

authority, and commanding him, upon signification given by the justices of

peace in London or the neighboring counties, of such offenders worthy to

be speedily executed by martial law, to attach and take the same persons,

and in the presence of the said justices, according to justice of martial

law, to execute them upon the gallows or gibbet openly, or near to such

place where the said rebellious and incorrigible offenders shall be found

to have committed the said great offences.”[*] I suppose it would be

difficult to produce an instance of such an act of authority in any place

nearer than Muscovy. The patent of high constable, granted to Earl Rivers

by Edward IV., proves the nature of the office. The powers are unlimited,

perpetual, and remain in force during peace as well as during war and

rebellion. The parliament in Edward VI.‘s reign acknowledged the

jurisdiction of the constable and martial’s court to be part of the law of

the land.[**]

 

The star chamber, and high commission, and court martial, though arbitrary

jurisdictions, had still some pretence of a trial, at least of a sentence;

but there was a grievous punishment very generally inflicted in that age,

without any other authority than the warrant of a secretary of state or of

the privy council;[***] and that was, imprisonment in any jail, and during

any time, that the ministers should think proper. In suspicious times, all

the jails were full of prisoners of state; and these unhappy victims of

public jealousy were sometimes thrown into dungeons, and loaded with

irons, and treated in the most cruel manner, without their being able to

obtain any remedy from law.

 

This practice was an indirect way of employing torture: but the rack

itself, though not admitted in the ordinary execution of justice,[****]

was frequently used, upon any suspicion, by authority of a warrant from a

secretary or the privy council. Even the council in the marches of Wales

was empowered, by their very commission, to make use of torture whenever

they thought proper.[v]

 

There cannot be a stronger proof how lightly the rack was employed than

the following story, told by Lord Bacon. We shall give it in his own

words: “The queen was mightily incensed against Haywarde, on account of a

book he dedicated to Lord Essex, being a story of the first year of Henry

IV., thinking it a seditious prelude to put into the people’s heads

boldness and faction:[*] she said, she had an opinion that there was

treason in it, and asked me if I could not find any places in it that

might be drawn within the case of treason? Whereto I answered, For

treason, sure I found none; but for felony, very many: and when her

majesty hastily asked me, Wherein? I told her, the author had committed

very apparent theft; for he had taken most of the sentences of Cornelius

Tacitus, and translated them into English, and put them into his text. And

another time, when the queen could not be persuaded that it was his

writing whose name was to it, but that it had some more mischievous

author, and said with great indignation, that she would have him racked to

produce his author; I replied, Nay, madam, he is a doctor; never rack his

person, but rack his style: let him have pen, ink, and paper, and help of

books, and be enjoined to continue the story where it breaketh off, and I

will undertake, by collating the styles, to judge whether he were the

author or no.”[**] Thus, had it not been for Bacon’s humanity, or rather

his wit, this author, a man of letters, had been put to the rack for a

most innocent performance. His real offence was his dedicating a book to

that munificent patron of the learned, the earl of Essex, at a time when

this nobleman lay under her majesty’s displeasure.

 

The queen’s menace of trying and punishing Haywarde for treason could

easily have been executed, let his book have been ever so innocent. While

so many terrors hung over the people, no jury durst have acquitted a man

when the court was resolved to have him condemned. The practice, also, of

not confronting witnesses with the prisoner, gave the crown lawyers all

imaginable advantage against him. And indeed there scarcely occurs an

instance during all these reigns, that the sovereign or the ministers were

ever disappointed in the issue of a prosecution. Timid juries, and judges

who held their offices during pleasure, never failed to second all the

views of the crown.

 

The power of pressing, both for sea and land service, and obliging any

person to accept of any office, however mean or unfit for him, was another

prerogative totally incompatible with freedom. Osborne gives the following

account of Elizabeth’s method of employing this prerogative: “In case she

found any likely to interrupt her occasions,” says he, “she did seasonably

prevent him by a chargeable employment abroad, or putting him upon some

service at home, which she knew least grateful to the people; contrary to

a false maxim, since practised with far worse success, by such princes as

thought it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends.”[*]

The practice with which Osborne reproaches the two immediate successors of

Elizabeth, proceeded partly from the extreme difficulty of their

situation, partly from the greater lenity of their disposition. The power

of pressing, as may naturally be imagined, was often abused, in other

respects, by men of inferior rank; and officers often exacted money for

freeing persons from the service.[**]

 

The government of England during that age, however different in other

particulars, bore in this respect some resemblance to that of Turkey at

present: the sovereign possessed every power, except that of imposing

taxes; and in both countries, this limitation, unsupported by other

privileges, appears rather prejudicial to the people. In Turkey, it

obliges the sultan to permit the extortion of the pashas and governors of

provinces, from whom he afterwards squeezes presents or takes forfeitures:

in England, it engaged the queen to erect monopolies, and grant patents

for exclusive trade; an invention so pernicious, that had she gone on

during a tract of years at her own rate, England, the seat of riches, and

arts, and commerce, would have contained at present as little industry as

Morocco or the coast of Barbary.

 

We may further observe that this valuable privilege, valuable only because

it proved afterwards the means by which the parliament extorted all their

other privileges, was very much encroached on, in an indirect manner,

during the reign of Elizabeth, as well as of her predecessors. She often

exacted loans from her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of

imposition, and which individuals felt severely; for though the money had

been regularly repaid, which was seldom the case,[*] it lay in the

prince’s hands without interest, which was a sensible loss to the persons

from whom the money was borrowed.[**]

 

There remains a proposal, made by Lord Burleigh, for levying a general

loan on the people, equivalent to a subsidy;[***] a scheme which would

have laid the burden more equally, but which was, in different words, a

taxation imposed without consent of parliament. It is remarkable, that the

scheme thus proposed, without any visible necessity, by that wise

minister, is the very same which Henry VIII. executed, and which Charles

I., enraged by ill usage from his parliament, and reduced to the greatest

difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the great discontent of the

nation.

 

The demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for taxing the

people. This practice was so little conceived to be irregular, that the

commons in 1585 offered the queen a benevolence; which she very generously

refused, as having no occasion at that time for money.[****] Queen Mary,

also, by an order of council, increased the customs in some branches; and

her sister imitated the example.[v] There was a species of ship money

imposed at the time of the Spanish invasion: the several ports were

required to equip a certain number of vessels at their own charge: and

such was the alacrity of the people for the public defence, that some of

the ports, particularly London, sent double the number demanded of

them.[v*]

 

When any levies were made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries, the

queen obliged the counties to levy the soldiers, to arm and clothe them,

and carry them to the seaports at their own charge. New-year’s gifts were

at that time expected from the nobility, and from the more considerable

gentry.[*]

 

Purveyance and preÃ«mption were also methods of taxation, unequal,

arbitrary, and oppressive. The whole kingdom sensibly felt the burden of

those impositions; and it was regarded as a great privilege conferred on

Oxford and Cambridge, to prohibit the purveyors from taking any

commodities within five miles of these universities. The queen victualled

her navy by means of this prerogative, during the first years of he

reign.[**]

 

Wardship was the most regular and legal of all these impositions by

prerogative; yet was it a great badge of slavery and oppressive to all the

considerable families. When an estate devolved to a female, the sovereign

obliged her to marry anyone he pleased: whether the heir were male or

female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the estate during the

minority. The giving of a rich wardship was a usual method of rewarding a

courtier or favorite.

 

The inventions were endless which arbitrary power might employ for the

extorting of money, while the people imagined that their property was

secured by the crown’s being debarred from imposing taxes. Strype has

preserved a speech of Lord Burleigh to the queen and council, in which are

contained some particulars not a little extraordinary.[***]

 

Burleigh proposes, that she should erect a court for the correction of all

abuses, and should confer on the commissioners a general inquisitorial

power over the whole kingdom. He sets before her the example of her wise

grandfather, Henry VII., who by such methods extremely augmented his

revenue; and he recommends that this new court should proceed, “as well by

the direction and ordinary course of the laws, as by virtue of her

majesty’s supreme regiment and absolute power, from whence law proceeded.”

In a word, he expects from this institution greater accession to the royal

treasure than Henry VIII. derived from the abolition of the abbeys, and

all the forfeitures of ecclesiastical revenues. This project of Lord

Burleigh’s needs not, I think, any comment. A form of government must be

very arbitrary indeed, where a wise and good minister could make such a

proposal to the sovereign.

 

Embargoes on merchandise was another engine of royal power, by which the

English princes were able to extort money from the people. We have seen

instances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her coronation, issued

an order to the custom-house, prohibiting the sale of all crimson silks

which should be imported, till the court were first supplied.[*] She

expected, no doubt, a good pennyworth from the merchants while they lay

under this restraint.

 

The parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws, as well as of

granting subsidies; but this privilege was, during that age, still more

insignificant than the other. Queen Elizabeth expressly prohibited them

from meddling either with state matters or ecclesiastical causes; and she

openly sent the members to prison who dared to transgress her imperial

edict in these particulars. There passed few sessions of parliament,

during her reign where there occur not instances of this arbitrary

conduct.

 

But the legislative power of the parliament was a mere fallacy, while the

sovereign was universally acknowledged to possess a dispensing power, by

which all the laws could be invalidated, and rendered of no effect. The

exercise of this power was also an indirect method practised for erecting

monopolies. Where the statutes laid any branch of manufacture under

restrictions, the sovereign, by exempting one person from the laws, gave

him in effect the monopoly of that commodity.[**] There was no grievance

at that time more universally complained of, than the frequent dispensing

with the penal laws.[***]

 

But in reality the crown possessed the full legislative power, by means of

proclamations, which might affect any matter, even of the greatest

importance, and which the star chamber took care to see more rigorously

executed than the laws themselves. The motives for these proclamations

were sometimes frivolous, and even ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had taken

offence at the smell of woad; and she issued an edict prohibiting any one

from cultivating that useful plant.[****]

 

She was also pleased to take offence at the long swords and high ruffs

then in fashion: she sent about her officers to break every man’s sword,

and clip every man’s ruff which was beyond a certain dimension.[*] This

practice resembles the method employed by the great Czar Peter to make his

subjects change their garb.

 

The queen’s prohibition of the “prophesyings,” or the assemblies

instituted for fanatical prayers and conferences, was founded on a better

reason, but shows still the unlimited extent of her prerogative. Any

number of persons could not meet together, in order to read the Scriptures

and confer about religion, though in ever so orthodox a manner, without

her permission.

 

There were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with an exact

or regular enjoyment of liberty. None of the nobility could marry without

permission from the sovereign. The queen detained the earl of Southampton

long in prison, because he privately married the earl of Essex’s

cousin.[**] No man could travel without the consent of the prince. Sir

William Evers underwent a severe persecution because he had presumed to

pay a private visit to the king of Scots.[***] The sovereign even assumed

a supreme and uncontrolled authority over all foreign trade; and neither

allowed any person to enter or depart the kingdom, nor any commodity to be

imported or exported, without his consent.[****]

 

The parliament, in the thirteenth of the queen, praised her for not

imitating the practice usual among her predecessors, of stopping the

course of justice by particular warrants.[v] There could not possibly be a

greater abuse, nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power; and the queen, in

refraining from it, was very laudable. But she was by no means constant in

this reserve. There remain in the public records some warrants of hers for

exempting particular persons from all law-suits and prosecutions;[v*] If

and these warrants, she says, she grants from her royal prerogative, which

she will not allow to be disputed.

 

It was very usual in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, and probably in all the

preceding reigns, for noblemen or privy counsellors to commit to prison

any one who had happened to displease them by suing for his just debts;

and the unhappy person, though he gained his cause in the courts of

justice, was commonly obliged to relinquish his property in order to

obtain his liberty. Some, likewise, who had been delivered from prison by

the judges, were again committed to custody in secret places, without any

possibility of obtaining relief; and even the officers and serjeants of

the courts of law were punished for executing the writs in favor of these

persons. Nay, it was usual to send for people by pursuivants, a kind of

harpies who then attended the orders of the council and high commission;

and they were brought up to London, and constrained by imprisonment, not

only to withdraw their lawful suits, but also to pay the pursuivants great

sums of money. The judges, in the thirty-fourth of the queen, complain to

her majesty of the frequency of this practice. It is probable that so

egregious a tyranny was carried no farther down than the reign of

Elizabeth; since the parliament who presented the petition of right found

no later instances of it.[*] And even these very judges of Elizabeth, who

thus protect the people against the tyranny of the great, expressly allow,

that a person committed by special command of the queen is not bailable.

 

It is easy to imagine that, in such a government, no justice could by

course of law be obtained of the sovereign, unless he were willing to

allow it. In the naval expedition undertaken by Raleigh and Frobisher

against the Spaniards, in the year 1592, a very rich carrack was taken,

worth two hundred thousand pounds. The queen’s share in the adventure was

only a tenth; but as the prize was so great, and exceeded so much the

expectation of all the adventurers, she was determined not to rest

contented with her share. Raleigh humbly and earnestly begged her to

accept of a hundred thousand pounds in lieu of all demands, or rather

extortions; and says that the present which the proprietors were willing

to make her of eighty thousand pounds, was the greatest that ever prince

received from a subject.[**]

 

But it is no wonder the queen, in her administration, should pay so little

regard to liberty, while the parliament itself, in enacting laws, was

entirely negligent of it. The persecuting statutes which they passed

against Papists and Puritans are extremely contrary to the genius of

freedom; and by exposing such multitudes to the tyranny of priests and

bigots, accustomed the people to the most disgraceful subjection. Their

conferring an unlimited supremacy on the queen, or, what is worse,

acknowledging her inherent right to it, was another proof of their

voluntary servitude.

 

The law of the twenty-third of her reign, making seditious words against

the queen capital, is also a very tyrannical statute; and a use no less

tyrannical was sometimes made of it. The case of Udal, a Puritanical

clergyman, seems singular even in those arbitrary times. This man had

published a book, called a Demonstration of Discipline, in which he

inveighed against the government of bishops; and though he had carefully

endeavored to conceal his name, he was thrown into prison upon suspicion,

and brought to a trial for this offence. It was pretended, that the

bishops were part of the queen’s political body; and to speak against

them, was really to attack her, and was therefore felony by the statute.

This was not the only iniquity to which Udal was exposed. The judges would

not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact, whether Udal had

written the book or not, without examining his intention, or the import of

the words. In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not produce a

single witness to the court: they only read the testimony of two persons

absent, one of whom said, that Udal had told him he was the author;

another, that a friend of Udal’s had said so. They would not allow Udal to

produce any exculpatory evidence; which, they said, was never to be

permitted against the crown.[*] And they tendered him an oath, by which he

was required to depose that he was not the author of the book; and his

refusal to make that deposition was employed as the strongest proof of his

guilt. It is almost needless to add, that notwithstanding these multiplied

iniquities, a verdict of death was given by the jury against Udal; for, as

the queen was extremely bent upon his prosecution, it was impossible he

could escape.[**] He died in prison, before execution of the sentence.

 

The case of Penry was, if possible, still hardier. This man was a zealous

Puritan, or rather a Brownist, a small sect, which afterwards increased,

and received the name of “Independents.” He had written against the

hierarchy several tracts, such as Martin Marprelate, Theses MartinianÃ¦,

and other compositions, full of low scurrility and petulant satire. After

concealing himself for some years, he was seized; and as the statute

against seditious words required that the criminal should be tried within

a year after committing the offence, he could not be indicted for his

printed books. He was therefore tried for some papers found in his pocket,

as if he had thereby scattered sedition.[*] It was also imputed to him, by

the lord keeper, Puckering, that in some of these papers, “he had only

acknowledged her majesty’s royal power to establish laws ecclesiastical

and civil; but had avoided the usual terms of making, enacting, decreeing,

and ordaining laws; which imply,” says the lord keeper, “a most absolute

authority.”[**] Penry for these offences was condemned and executed.

 

Thus we have seen, that the “most absolute” authority of the sovereign, to

make use of the lord keeper’s expression was established on above twenty

branches of prerogative, which are now abolished, and which were, every

one of them totally incompatible with the liberty of the subject. But what

insured more effectually the slavery of the people, than even these

branches of prerogative, was, the established principles of the times,

which attributed to the prince such an unlimited and indefeasible power,

as was supposed to be the origin of all law, and could be circumscribed by

none. The homilies published for the use of the clergy, and which they

were enjoined to read every Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every

where a blind and unlimited passive obedience to the prince, which on no

account, and under no pretence, is it ever lawful for subjects in the

smallest article to depart from or infringe. Much noise has been made

because some court chaplains, during the succeeding reigns, were permitted

to preach such doctrines; but there is a great difference between these

sermons, and discourses published by authority, avowed by the prince and

council, and promulgated to the whole nation.[***]

 

So thoroughly were these principles imbibed by the people, during the

reigns of Elizabeth and her predecessors, that opposition to them was

regarded as the most flagrant sedition; and was not even rewarded by that

public praise and approbation, which can alone support men under such

dangers and difficulties as attend the resistance of tyrannical

authority.[*] It was only during the next generation that the noble

principles of liberty took root, and spreading themselves under the

shelter of Puritanical absurdities, became fashionable among the people.

 

It is worth remarking, that the advantage usually ascribed to absolute

monarchy, a greater regularity of police, and a more strict execution of

the laws, did not attend the former English government, though in many

respects it fell under that denomination. A demonstration of this truth is

contained in a judicious paper which is preserved by Strype,[**] and which

was written by an eminent justice of peace of Somersetshire, in the year

1596, near the end of the queen’s reign; when the authority of that

princess may be supposed to be fully corroborated by time, and her maxims

of government improved by long practice.

 

This paper contains an account of the disorders which then prevailed in

the county of Somerset. The author says, that forty persons had there been

executed in a year for robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five

burnt in the hand, thirty-seven whipped, one hundred and eighty-three

discharged: that those who were discharged were most wicked and desperate

persons, who never could come to any good, because they would not work,

and none would take them into service: that notwithstanding this great

number of indictments, the fifth part of the felonies committed in the

county were not brought to trial; the greater number escaped censure,

either from the superior cunning of the felons, the remissness of the

magistrates, or the foolish lenity of the people: that the rapines

committed by the infinite number of wicked, wandering, idle people, were

intolerable to the poor countrymen, and obliged them to keep a perpetual

watch over their sheepfolds, their pastures, their woods, and their

cornfields: that the other counties of England were in no better condition

than Somersetshire; and many of them were even in a worse: that there were

at least three or four hundred able-bodied vagabonds in every county, who

lived by theft and rapine; and who sometimes met in troops to the number

of sixty, and committed spoil on the inhabitants: that if all the felons

of this kind were assembled, they would be able, if reduced to good

subjection, to give the greatest enemy her majesty has a “strong battle:”

and that the magistrates themselves were intimidated from executing the

laws upon them; and there were instances of justices of peace who, after

giving sentence against rogues, had interposed to stop the execution of

their own sentence, on account of the danger which hung over them from the

confederates of these felons.

 

In the year 1575, the queen complained in parliament of the bad execution

of the laws; and threatened, that if the magistrates were not for the

future more vigilant, she would intrust authority to indigent and needy

persons, who would find an interest in a more exact administration of

justice.[*] It appears that she was as good as her word. For in the year

1601, there were great complaints made in parliament of the rapine of

justices of peace; and a member said, that this magistrate was an animal

who, for half a dozen of chickens, would dispense with a dozen of penal

statutes.[**] It is not easy to account for this relaxation of government,

and neglect of police, during a reign of so much vigor as that of

Elizabeth. The small revenue of the crown is the most likely cause that

can be assigned. The queen had it not in her power to interest a great

number in assisting her to execute the laws.[***] 39
 

On the whole, the English have no reason, from the example of their

ancestors, to be in love with the picture of absolute monarchy; or to

prefer the unlimited authority of the prince and his unbounded

prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that sweet equality, and that happy

security, by which they are at present distinguished above all nations in

the universe. The utmost that can be said in favor of the government of

that age and perhaps it may be said with truth, is, that the power of the

prince, though really unlimited, was exercised after the European manner,

and entered not into every part of the administration; that the instances

of a high exerted prerogative were not so frequent as to render property

sensibly insecure, or reduce the people to a total servitude; that the

freedom from faction, the quickness of execution, and the promptitude of

those measures which could be taken for offence or defence, made some

compensation for the want of a legal and determinate liberty; that as the

prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a tacit check on him, which

maintained the government in that medium, to which the people had been

accustomed; and that this situation of England, though seemingly it

approached nearer, was in reality more remote from a despotic and Eastern

monarchy, than the present government of that kingdom, where the people,

though guarded by multiplied laws, are totally naked, defenceless, and

disarmed; and besides, are not secured by any middle power, or independent

powerful nobility, interposed between them and the monarch.

 

We shall close the present Appendix with a brief account of the revenues,

the military force, the commerce, the arts, and the learning of England

during this period.

 

Queen Elizabeth’s economy was remarkable; and in some instances seemed to

border on avarice. The smallest expense, if it could possibly be spared,

appeared considerable in her eyes; and even the charge of an express,

during the most delicate transactions, was not below her notice.[*] She

was also attentive to every profit, and embraced opportunities of gain

which may appear somewhat extraordinary. She kept, for instance, the see

of Ely vacant nineteen years, in order to retain the revenue;[**] and it

was usual with her, when she promoted a bishop, to take the opportunity of

pillaging the see of some of its manors.[***]

 

But that in reality there was little of no avarice in the queen’s temper,

appears from this circumstance, that she never amassed any treasure; and

even refused subsidies from the parliament when she had no present

occasion for them. Yet we must not conclude, from this circumstance, that

her economy proceeded from a tender concern for her people; she loaded

them with monopolies and exclusive patents, which are much more oppressive

than the most heavy taxes levied in an equal and regular manner. The real

source of her frugal conduct was derived from her desire of independency,

and her care to preserve her dignity, which would have been endangered had

she reduced herself to the necessity of having frequent recourse to

parliamentary supplies. In consequence of this motive, the queen, though

engaged in successful and necessary wars, thought it more prudent to make

a continual dilapidation of the royal demesnes,[*] than demand the most

moderate supplies from the commons. As she lived unmarried, and had no

posterity, she was content to serve her present turn, though at the

expense of her successors; who, by reason of this policy, joined to other

circumstances, found themselves on a sudden reduced to the most extreme

indigence.

 

The splendor of a court was during this age a great part of the public

charge; and as Elizabeth was a single woman, and expensive in no kind of

magnificence, except clothes, this circumstance enabled her to perform

great things by her narrow revenue. She is said to have paid four millions

of debt, left on the crown by her father, brother, and sister; an

incredible sum for that age.[**] The states at the time of her death owed

her about eight hundred thousand pounds; and, the king of France four

hundred and fifty thousand.[***]

 

Though that prince was extremely frugal, and after the peace of Vervins

was continually amassing treasure, the queen never could, by the most

pressing importunities, prevail on him to make payment of those sums which

she had so generously advanced him during his greatest distresses. One

payment of twenty thousand crowns, and another of fifty thousand, were all

she could obtain, by the strongest representations she could make of the

difficulties to which the rebellion in Ireland had reduced her.[*] The

queen expended on the wars with Spain, between the years 1589 and 1593,

the sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds, besides the pittance

of a double subsidy, amounting to two hundred and eighty thousand pounds,

granted her by parliament.[**] In the year 1599, she spent six hundred

thousand pounds in six months on the service of Ireland.[***] Sir Robert

Cecil affirmed, that in ten years Ireland cost her three millions four

hundred thousand pounds.[****] She gave the earl of Essex a present of

thirty thousand pounds upon his departure for the government of that

kingdom.[v] Lord Burleigh computed, that the value of the gifts conferred

on that favorite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds; a sum which,

though probably exaggerated, is a proof of her strong affection towards

him. It was a common saying during this reign, “The queen pays

bountifully, though she rewards sparingly.”[v*]

 

It is difficult to compute exactly the queen’s ordinary revenue, but it

certainly fell much short of five hundred thousand pounds a year.[v**] In

the year 1590, she raised the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year

to fifty thousand, and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who had farmed them, to

refund some of his former profits.[v***]

 

This improvement of the revenue was owing to the suggestions of one

Caermarthen; and was opposed by Burleigh, Leicester, and Walsingham: but

the queen’s perseverance overcame all their opposition. The great

undertakings which she executed with so narrow a revenue, and with such

small supplies from her people, prove the mighty effects of wisdom and

economy. She received from the parliament, during the course of her whole

reign, only twenty subsidies and thirty-nine fifteenths. I pretend not to

determine exactly the amount of these supplies; because the value of a

subsidy was continually falling; and in the end of her reign it amounted

only to eighty thousand pounds,[*] though in the beginning it had been a

hundred and twenty thousand. If we suppose that the supplies granted

Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years amounted to three millions,

we shall not probably be much wide of the truth.[**] This sum makes only

sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pounds a year; and it is

surprising, that while the queen’s demands were so moderate, and her

expenses so well regulated, she should ever have found any difficulty in

obtaining a supply from parliament, or be reduced to make sale of the

crown lands. But such was the extreme, I had almost said, absurd parsimony

of the parliaments during that period.

 

They valued nothing in comparison of their money: the members had no

connection with the court; and the very idea which they conceived of the

trust committed to them, was, to reduce the demands of the crown, and to

grant as few supplies as possible. The crown, on the other hand, conceived

the parliament in no other light than as a means of supply. Queen

Elizabeth made a merit to her people of seldom summoning parliaments.[*]

No redress of grievances was expected from these assemblies: they were

supposed to meet for no other purpose than to impose taxes.

 

Before the reign of Elizabeth, the English princes had usually recourse to

the city of Antwerp for voluntary loans; and their credit was so low,

that, besides paying the high interest of ten or twelve per cent., they

were obliged to make the city of London join in the security. Sir Thomas

Gresham, that great and enterprising merchant, one of the chief ornaments

of this reign, engaged the company of merchant-adventurers to grant a loan

to the queen; and as the money was regularly repaid, her credit by degrees

established itself in the city, and she shook off this dependence on

foreigners.[**]

 

In the year 1559, however, the queen employed Gresham to borrow for her

two hundred thousand pounds at Antwerp, in order to enable her to reform

the coin, which was at that time extremely debased.[***] She was so

impolitic as to make, herself, an innovation in the coin; by dividing a

pound of silver into sixty-two shillings, instead of sixty, the former

standard. This is the last time that the coin has been tampered with in

England.

 

Queen Elizabeth, sensible how much the defence of her kingdom depended on

its naval power, was desirous to encourage commerce and navigation: but as

her monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic industry, which is much

more valuable than foreign trade, and is the foundation of it, the general

train of her conduct was ill calculated to serve the purpose at which she

aimed, much less to promote the riches of her people. The exclusive

companies also were an immediate check on foreign trade. Yet,

notwithstanding these discouragements, the spirit of the age was strongly

bent on naval enterprises; and besides the military expeditions against

the Spaniards, many attempts were made for new discoveries, and many new

branches of foreign commerce were opened by the English. Sir Martin

Frobisher undertook three fruitless voyages to discover the north-west

passage: Davis, not discouraged by this ill success, made a new attempt,

when he discovered the straits which pass by his name. In the year 1600,

the queen granted the first patent to the East India Company: the stock of

that company was seventy-two thousand pounds; and they fitted out four

ships, under the command of James Lancaster, for this new branch of trade.

The adventure was successful; and the ships returning with a rich cargo,

encouraged the company to continue the commerce.

 

The communication with Muscovy had been opened in Queen Mary’s time by the

discovery of the passage to Archangel: but the commerce to that country

did not begin to be carried on to a great extent till about the year 1569.

The queen obtained from the czar an exclusive patent to the English for

the whole trade of Muscovy;[*] and she entered into a personal as well as

national alliance with him. This czar was named John Basilides, a furious

tyrant, who, continually suspecting the revolt of his subjects, stipulated

to have a safe retreat and protection in England. In order the better to

insure this resource, he purposed to marry an English woman; and the queen

intended to have sent him Lady Anne Hastings; daughter of the earl of

Huntingdon: but when the lady was informed of the barbarous manners of the

country, she wisely declined purchasing an empire at the expense of her

ease and safety.[**]

 

The English, encouraged by the privileges which they had obtained from

Basilides, ventured farther into those countries than any Europeans had

formerly done. They transported their goods along the River Dwina in boats

made of one entire tree, which they towed and rowed up the stream as far

as Walogda. Thence they carried their commodities seven days’ journey by

land to Yeraslau, and then down the Volga to Astracan. At Astracan they

built ships, crossed the Caspian Sea, and distributed their manufactures

into Persia. But this bold attempt met with such discouragements, that it

was never renewed.[***]

 

After the death of John Basilides, his son Theodore revoked the patent

which the English enjoyed for a monopoly of the Russian trade: when the

queen remonstrated against this innovation, he told her ministers, that

princes must carry an indifferent hand, as well between their subjects as

between foreigners; and not convert trade, which, by the laws of nations,

ought to be common to all, into a monopoly for the private gain of a

few.[*] So much juster notions of commerce were entertained by this

barbarian than appear in the conduct of the renowned Queen Elizabeth!

Theodore, however, continued some privileges to the English, on account of

their being the discoverers of the communication between Europe and his

country.

 

The trade to Turkey commenced about the year 1583; and that commerce was

immediately confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time,

the grand seignior had always conceived England to be a dependent province

of France;[**] but having heard of the queen’s power and reputation, he

gave a good reception to the English, and even granted them larger

privileges than he had given to the French.

 

The merchants of the Hanse Towns complained loudly, in the beginning of

Elizabeth’s reign, of the treatment which they had received in the reigns

of Edward and Mary. She prudently replied, that as she would not innovate

any thing, she would still protect them in the immunities and privileges

of which she found them possessed. This answer not contenting them, their

commerce was soon after suspended for a time, to the great advantage of

the English merchants, who tried what they could themselves effect for

promoting their commerce. They took the whole trade into their own hands;

and their returns proving successful, they divided themselves into

staplers and merchant adventurers; the former residing constantly at one

place, the latter trying their fortunes in other towns and states abroad

with cloth and other manufactures. This success so enraged the Hanse

Towns, that they tried all the methods which a discontented people could

devise, to draw upon the English merchants the ill opinion of other

nations and states. They prevailed so far as to obtain an imperial edict,

by which the English were prohibited all commerce in the empire: the

queen, by way of retaliation, retained sixty of their ships, which had

been seized in the River Tagus with contraband goods of the Spaniards.

These ships the queen intended to have restored, as desiring to have

compromised all differences with those trading cities; but when she was

informed, that a general assembly was held at Lubec, in order to concert

measures for distressing the English trade, she caused the ships and

cargoes to be confiscated: only two of them were released to carry home

the news, and to inform these states, that she had the greatest contempt

imaginable for all their proceedings.[*]

 

Henry VIII., in order to fit out a navy, was obliged to hire ships from

Hamburgh, Lubec, Dantzic, Genoa, and Venice, but Elizabeth, very early in

her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by building some ships

of her own, and by encouraging the merchants to build large trading

vessels which, on occasion, were converted into ships of war.[**] In the

year 1582, the seamen in England were found to be fourteen thousand two

hundred and ninety-five men;[***] the number of vessels twelve hundred and

thirty-two; of which there were only two hundred and seventeen above

eighty tons. Monson pretends, that though navigation decayed in the first

years of James I., by the practice of the merchants, who carried on their

trade in foreign bottoms,[****] yet, before the year 1640, this number of

seamen was tripled in England.[v]

 

The navy which the queen left at her decease appears considerable, when we

reflect only on the number of vessels, which were forty-two: but when we

consider that none of these ships carried above forty guns; that four only

came up to that number; that there were but two ships of a thousand tons;

and twenty-three below five hundred, some of fifty, and some even of

twenty tons; and that the whole number of guns belonging to the fleet was

seven hundred and seventy four;[v*] we must entertain a contemptible idea

of the English navy, compared to the force which it has now attained.[*]

In the year 1588, there were not above five vessels fitted out by the

noblemen and seaports, which exceeded two hundred tons.[v**] 40
 

In the year 1575, all the militia in the kingdom were computed at a

hundred and eighty-two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine.[*] A

distribution was made, in the year 1595, of a hundred and forty thousand

men, besides those which Wales could supply.[**] These armies were

formidable by their numbers; but their discipline and experience were not

proportionate. Small bodies from Dunkirk and Newport frequently ran over

and plundered the east coast: so unfit was the militia, as it was then

constituted, for the defence of the kingdom. The lord lieutenants were

first appointed to the counties in this reign.

 

Mr. Murden[***] has published, from the Salisbury collections, a paper

which contains the military force of the nation at the time of the Spanish

armada, and which is somewhat different from the account given by our

ordinary historians. It makes all the able-bodied men of the kingdom

amount to a hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and thirteen; those

armed, to eighty thousand eight hundred and seventy-five; of whom

forty-four thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven were trained. It must

be supposed that these able-bodied men consisted of such only as were

registered, otherwise the small number is not to be accounted for. Yet Sir

Edward Coke[****] said, in the house of commons, that he was employed

about the same time, together with Popham, chief justice, to take a survey

of all the people of England, and that they found them to be nine hundred

thousand of all sorts. This number, by the ordinary rules of computation,

supposes that there were above two hundred thousand men able to bear arms.

Yet even this number is surprisingly small. Can we suppose that the

kingdom is six or seven times more populous at present? and that Murden’s

was the real number of men, excluding Catholics, and children, and infirm

persons?

 

Harrison says, that in the musters taken in the years 1574 and 1575, the

men fit for service amounted to one million one hundred and seventy-two

thousand six hundred and seventy-four; yet was it believed that a full

third was omitted. Such uncertainty and contradiction are there in all

these accounts.

 

Notwithstanding the greatness of this number, the same author complains

much of the decay of populousness; a vulgar complaint in all places and

all ages. Guicciardini makes the inhabitants of England in this reign

amount to two millions.

 

Whatever opinion we may form of the comparative populousness of England in

different periods, it must be allowed that, abstracting from the national

debt, there is a prodigious increase of power in that, more perhaps than

in any other European state, since the beginning of the last century. It

would be no paradox to affirm, that Ireland alone could, at present, exert

a greater force than all the three kingdoms were capable of at the death

of Queen Elizabeth. And we might go further, and assert, that one good

county in England is able to make, at least to support, a greater effort

than the whole kingdom was capable of in the reign of Henry V.; when the

maintenance of a garrison in a small town like Calais, formed more than a

third of the ordinary national expense. Such are the effects of liberty,

industry, and good government!

 

The state of the English manufactures was at this time very low; and

foreign wares of almost all kinds had the preference.[*] About the year

1590, there were in London four persons only rated in the subsidy books so

high as four hundred pounds.[**] This computation is not indeed to be

deemed an exact estimate of their wealth. In 1567, there were found, on

inquiry, to be four thousand eight hundred and fifty-one strangers of all

nations in London; of whom three thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight

were Flemings, and only fifty-eight Scots.[***] The persecutions in France

and the Low Countries drove afterwards a greater number of foreigners into

England; and the commerce, as well as manufactures of that kingdom, was

very much improved by them.[****] It was then that Sir Thomas Gresham

built, at his own charge, the magnificent fabric of the Exchange for the

reception of the merchants: the queen visited it, and gave it the

appellation of the Royal Exchange.

 

By a lucky accident in language, which has a great effect on men’s ideas,

the invidious word usury which formerly meant the taking of any interest

for money, came now to express only the taking of exorbitant and illegal

interest. An act passed in 1571 violently condemns all usury; but permits

ten per cent, interest to be paid. Henry IV. of France reduced Interest to

six and a half per cent.; an indication of the great advance of France

above England in commerce.

 

Dr. Howell says,[*] that Queen Elizabeth, in the third of her reign, was

presented with a pair of black silk knit stockings by her silk-woman, and

never wore cloth hose any more. The author of the Present State of

England, says, that about 1577, pocket watches were first brought into

England from Germany. They are thought to have been invented at Nurem

berg. About 1580, the use of coaches was introduced by the earl of

Arundel.[**] Before that time, the queen, on public occasions, rode behind

her chamberlain.

 

Camden says, that in 1581, Randolph, so much employed by the queen in

foreign embassies, possessed the office of postmaster-general of England.

It appears, therefore, that posts were then established; though from

Charles I.‘s regulations in 1635, it would seem that few post-houses were

erected before that time.

 

In a remonstrance of the Hanse Towns to the diet of the empire, in 1582,

it is affirmed that England exported annually about two hundred thousand

pieces of cloth.[***] This number seems to be much exaggerated.

 

In the fifth of this reign was enacted the first law for the relief of the

poor.

 

A judicious author of that age confirms the vulgar observation, that the

kingdom was depopulating, from the increase of enclosures and decay of

tillage; and he ascribes the reason very justly to the restraints put oh

the exportation of corn; while full liberty was allowed to export all the

produce of pasturage, such as wool, hides, leather, tallow, etc. These

prohibitions of exportation were derived from the prerogative, and were

very injudicious. The queen once, on the commencement of her reign, had

tried a contrary practice, and with good success. From the same author we

learn, that the complaints renewed in our time were then very common,

concerning the high prices of every thing.[****]

 

There were two attempts made in this reign to settle colonies in America;

one by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter Raleigh

in Virginia: but neither of these projects proved successful. All those

noble settlements were made in the following reigns. The current specie of

the kingdom, in the end of this reign, is computed at four millions.[*]

 

The earl of Leicester desired Sir Francis Walsingham, then ambassador in

France, to provide him with a riding master in that country, to whom he

promises a hundred pounds a year, besides maintaining himself and servant

and a couple of horses. “I know,” adds the earl, “that such a man as I

want may receive higher wages in France: but let him consider, that a

shilling in England goes as far as two shillings in France.” [**] It is

known that every thing is much changed since that time.

 

The nobility in this age still supported, in some degree, the ancient

magnificence in their hospitality, and in the numbers of their retainers;

and the queen found it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their

expenses in this last particular.[***] The expense of hospitality she

somewhat encouraged, by the frequent visits she paid her nobility, and the

sumptuous feasts which she received from them.

 

Harrison, after enumerating the queen’s palaces, adds, “But what shall I

need to take upon me to repeat all, and tell what houses the queen’s

majesty hath? Sith all is hers; and when it pleaseth her in the summer

season to recreate herself abroad, and view the estate of the country, and

hear the complaints of her poor commons injured by her unjust officers or

their substitutes, every nobleman’s house is her palace, where she

continueth during pleasure and tell her an entertainment in Kenilworth

Castle, which was extraordinary for expense and magnificence.” Among other

particulars, we are told that three hundred and sixty-five hogsheads of

beer were drunk at it.[*] The earl had fortified this castle at great

expense; and it contained arms for ten thousand men.[**] The earl of Derby

had a family consisting of two hundred and forty servants.[***] Stowe

remarks it as a singular proof of beneficence in this nobleman, that he

was contented with his rent from his tenants, and exacted not any

extraordinary services from them; a proof that the great power of the

sovereign (what was almost unavoidable) had very generally countenanced

the nobility in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh, though he was

frugal, and had no paternal estate, kept a family consisting of a hundred

servants.[****] He had a standing table for gentlemen, and two other

tables for persons of meaner condition, which were always served alike,

whether he were in town or in the country. About his person he had people

of great distinction; insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen

retainers who had each a thousand pounds a year; and as many among his

ordinary servants who were worth from a thousand pounds to three, five,

ten, and twenty thousand pounds.[v] It is to be remarked, that though the

revenues of the crown were at that time very small, the ministers and

courtiers sometimes found means, by employing the boundless prerogative,

to acquire greater fortunes than it is possible for them at present to

amass, from their larger salaries, and more limited authority.

 

Burleigh entertained the queen twelve several times in his country house;

where she remained three, four, or five weeks at a time. Each visit cost

him two or three thousand pounds.[v*] The quantity of silver plate

possessed by this nobleman is surprising; no less than fourteen or fifteen

thousand pounds weight;[v**] which, besides the fashion, would be above

forty-two thousand pounds sterling in value. Yet Burleigh left only four

thousand pounds a year in land, and eleven thousand pounds in money; and

as land was then commonly sold at ten years’ purchase, his plate was

nearly equal to all the rest of his fortune. It appears that little value

was then put upon the fashion of the plate, which probably was but rude:

the weight was chiefly considered.

 

But though there were preserved great remains of the ancient customs, the

nobility were by degrees acquiring a taste for elegant luxury; and many

edifices, in particular were built by them, neat, large, and sumptuous; to

the great ornament of the kingdom, says Camden,[*] 41 but to the no less decay

of the glorious hospitality of the nation. It is, however, more reasonable

to think, that this new turn of expense promoted arts and industry; while

the ancient hospitality was the source of vice, disorder, sedition, and

idleness.[**]

 

Among the other species of luxury, that of apparel began much to increase

during this age; and the queen thought proper to restrain it by

proclamation.[***] Her example was very little conformable to her edicts.

As no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty, or more desirous of

making impression on the hearts of beholders, no one ever went to a

greater extravagance in apparel, or studied more the variety and richness

of her dresses. She appeared almost every day in a different habit; and

tried all the several modes by which she hoped to render herself

agreeable. She was also so fond of her clothes, that she never could part

with any of them; and at her death she had in her wardrobe all the

different habits, to the number of three thousand, which she had ever worn

in her lifetime.[****] 42
 

The retrenchment of the ancient hospitality, and the diminution of

retainers, were favorable to the prerogative of the sovereign; and, by

disabling the great noblemen from resistance, promoted the execution of

the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of justice. There were

many peculiar causes in the situation and character of Henry VII. which

augmented the authority of the crown: most of these causes concurred in

succeeding princes; together with the factions in religion, and the

acquisition of the supremacy, a most important article of prerogative: but

the manners of the age were a general cause, which operated during this

whole period, and which continually tended to diminish the riches, and

still more the influence, of the aristocracy, anciently so formidable to

the crown. The habits of luxury dissipated the immense fortunes of the

ancient barons: and as the new methods of expense gave subsistence to

mechanics and merchants, who lived in an independent manner on the fruits

of their own industry, a nobleman, instead of that unlimited ascendant

which he was wont to assume over those who were maintained at his board,

or subsisted by salaries conferred on them, retained only that moderate

influence which customers have over tradesmen, and which can never be

dangerous to civil government. The landed proprietors also, having a

greater demand for money than for men, endeavored to turn their lands to

the best account with regard to profit; and either enclosing their fields,

or joining many small farms into a few large ones, dismissed those useless

hands which formerly were always at their call in every attempt to subvert

the government, or oppose a neighboring baron. By all these means the

cities increased; the middle rank of men began to be rich and powerful;

the prince, who in effect was the same with the law, was implicitly

obeyed: and though the further progress of the same causes begat a new

plan of liberty, founded on the privileges of the commons, yet in the

interval between the fall of the nobles and the rise of this order, the

sovereign took advantage of the present situation, and assumed an

authority almost absolute.

 

Whatever may be commonly imagined, from the authority of Lord Bacon, and

from that of Harrington, and later authors the laws of Henry VII.

contributed very little towards the great revolution which happened about

this period in the English constitution. The practice of breaking entails

by a fine and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding reigns; and

this prince only gave indirectly a legal sanction to the practice, by

reforming some abuses which attended it. But the settled authority which

he acquired to the crown enabled the sovereign to encroach on the separate

jurisdictions of the barons, and produced a more general and regular

execution of the laws. The counties palatine underwent the same fate as

the feudal powers; and, by a statute of Henry VIII.,[*] the jurisdiction

of these counties was annexed to the crown, and all writs were ordained to

run in the king’s name. But the change of manners was the chief cause of

the secret revolution of government, and subverted the power of the

barons. There appear still in this reign some remains of the ancient

slavery of the boors and peasants,[*] but none afterwards.

 

Learning, on its revival, was held in high estimation by the English

princes and nobles; and as it was not yet prostituted by being too common,

even the great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a character for

literature. The four successive sovereigns, Henry, Edward, Mary, and

Elizabeth, may, on one account or other, be admitted into the class of

authors. Queen Catharine Parr translated a book: Lady Jane Gray,

considering her age, and her sex, and her station, may be regarded as a

prodigy of literature. Sir Thomas Smith was raised from being professor in

Cambridge, first to be ambassador to France, then secretary of state. The

despatches of those times, and among others those of Burleigh himself, are

frequently interlarded with quotations from the Greek and Latin classics.

Even the ladies of the court valued themselves on knowledge: Lady

Burleigh, Lady Bacon, and their two sisters, were mistresses of the

ancient as well as modern languages; and placed more pride in their

erudition than in their rank and quality.

 

Queen Elizabeth wrote and translated several books: and she was familiarly

acquainted with the Greek as well as Latin tongue.[**] 43
 

It is pretended that she made an extemporary reply in Greek to the

university of Cambridge, who had addressed her in that language. It is

certain that she answered in Latin without premeditation, and in a very

spirited manner, to the Polish ambassador, who had been wanting in respect

to her. When she had finished, she turned about to her courtiers, and

said, “God’s death, my lords,” (for she was much addicted to swearing,) “I

have been forced this day to scour up my old Latin, that hath long lain

rusting.”[*]

 

Elizabeth, even after she was queen, did not entirely drop the ambition of

appearing as an author; and, next to her desire of admiration for beauty,

this seems to have been the chief object of her vanity. She translated

Boethius of the Consolation of Philosophy; in order, as she pretended, to

allay her grief for Henry IV.‘s change of religion. As far us we can judge

from Elizabeth’s compositions, we may pronounce that, notwithstanding her

application, and her excellent parts, her taste in literature was but

indifferent: she was much inferior to her successor in this particular,

who was himself no perfect model of eloquence.

 

Unhappily for literature, at least for the learned of this age, the

queen’s vanity lay more in shining by her own learning, than in

encouraging men of genius by her liberality. Spenser himself, the finest

English writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the death of Sir

Philip Sidney, his patron, was allowed to die almost for want. This poet

contains great beauties, a sweet and harmonious versification, easy

elocution, a fine imagination; yet does the perusal of his work become so

tedious, that one never finishes it from the mere pleasure which it

affords; it soon becomes a kind of task-reading, and it requires some

effort and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance.

This effect, of which every one is conscious, is usually ascribed to the

change of manners: but manners have more changed since Homer’s age; and

yet that poet remains still the favorite of every reader of taste and

judgment. Homer copied true natural manners, which, however rough or

uncultivated, will always form an agreeable and interesting picture; but

the pencil of the English poet was employed in drawing the affectations,

and conceits, and fopperies of chivalry, which appear ridiculous as soon

as they lose the recommendation of the mode. The tediousness of continued

allegory, and that, too, seldom striking or ingenious, has also

contributed to render the Fairy Queen peculiarly tiresome; not to mention

the too great frequency of its descriptions, and the languor of its

stanza. Upon the whole, Spenser maintains his place upon the shelves among

our English classics; but he is seldom seen on the table; and there is

scarcely any one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confess, that,

notwithstanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an entertainment

with which the palate is soon satiated. Several writers of late have

amused themselves in copying the style of Spenser; and no imitation has

been so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance to the original:

his manner is so peculiar that it is almost impossible not to transfer

some of it into the copy.
