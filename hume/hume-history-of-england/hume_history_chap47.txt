This year the sudden death of Henry, prince of Wales, diffused a universal

grief throughout the nation. Though youth and royal birth, both of them

strong allurements, prepossess men mightily in favor of the early age of

princes, it is with peculiar fondness that historians mention Henry, and,

in every respect, his merit seems to have been extraordinary. He had not

reached his eighteenth year, and he already possessed more dignity in his

behavior, and commanded more respect, than his father, with all his age,

learning, and experience. Neither his high fortune, nor his youth, had

seduced him into any irregular pleasures: business and ambition seem to

have been his sole passion. His inclinations, as well as exercises, were

martial. The French ambassador, taking leave of him, and asking his

commands for France, found him employed in the exercise of the pike: “Tell

your king,” said he, “in what occupation you left me engaged.”[*] He had

conceived great affection and esteem for the brave Sir Walter Raleigh. It

was his saying, “Sure no king but my father would keep such a bird in a

cage.”[**]

 

He seems indeed to have nourished too violent a contempt for the king, on

account of his pedantry and pusillanimity; and by that means struck in

with the restless and martial spirit of the English nation. Had he lived,

he had probably promoted the glory, perhaps not the felicity, of his

people. The unhappy prepossession which men commonly entertain in favor of

ambition, courage, enterprise, and other warlike virtues, engages generous

natures, who always love fame, in such pursuits all destroy their own

peace, and that of the rest of mankind.

 

Violent reports were propagated, as if Henry had been carried off by

poison; but the physicians, on opening his body, found no symptoms to

confirm such an opinion.[*] The bold and criminal malignity of men’s

tongues and pens spared not even the king on the occasion. But that

prince’s character seems rather to have failed in the extreme of facility

and humanity, than in that of cruelty and violence. His indulgence to

Henry was great, and perhaps imprudent, by giving him a large and

independent settlement, even in so early youth.

 

1613.

 

The marriage of the princess Elizabeth with Frederic, elector palatine,

was finished some time after the death of the prince, and served to

dissipate the grief which arose on that melancholy event. But this

marriage, though celebrated with great joy and festivity, proved itself an

unhappy event to the king, as well as to his son-in-law, and had ill

consequences on the reputation and fortunes of both. The elector, trusting

to so great an alliance, engaged in enterprises beyond his strength: and

the king, not being able to support him in his distress, lost entirely, in

the end of his life, what remained of the affections and esteem of his own

subjects.

 

Except during sessions of parliament, the history of this reign may more

properly be called the history of the court, than that of the nation. An

interesting object had for some years engaged the attention of the court;

it was a favorite, and one beloved by James with so profuse and unlimited

an affection, as left no room for any rival or competitor. About the end

of the year 1609, Robert Carre, a youth of twenty years of age, and of a

good family in Scotland, arrived in London, after having passed some time

in his travels. All his natural accomplishments consisted in good looks:

all his acquired abilities in an easy air and graceful demeanor. He had

letters of recommendation to his countryman Lord Hay; and that nobleman no

sooner cast his eye upon him, than he discovered talents sufficient to

entitle him immediately to make a great figure in the government. Apprised

of the king’s passion for youth and beauty, and exterior appearance, he

studied how matters might be so managed that this new object should make

the strongest impression upon him. Without mentioning him at court, he

assigned him the office, at a match of tilting, of presenting to the king

his buckler and device; and hoped that he would attract the attention of

the monarch. Fortune proved favorable to his design, by an incident which

bore at first a contrary aspect. When Carre was advancing to execute his

office, his unruly horse flung him, and broke his leg in the king’s

presence. James approached him with pity and concern: love and affection

arose on the sight of his beauty and tender years; and the prince ordered

him immediately to be lodged in the palace, and to be carefully attended.

He himself, after the tilting, paid him a visit in his chamber, and

frequently returned during his confinement. The ignorance and simplicity

of the boy finished the conquest begun by his exterior graces and

accomplishments. Other princes have been fond of choosing their favorites

from among the lower ranks of their subjects, and have reposed themselves

on them with the more unreserved confidence and affection, because the

object has been beholden to their bounty for every honor and acquisition:

James was desirous that his favorite should also derive from him all his

sense, experience, and knowledge. Highly conceited of his own wisdom, he

pleased himself with the fancy, that this raw youth, by his lessons and

instructions, would, in a little time, be equal to his sagest ministers,

and be initiated into all the profound mysteries of government, on which

he set so high a value. And as this kind of creation was more perfectly

his own work than any other, he seems to have indulged an unlimited

fondness for his minion, beyond even that which he bore to his own

children. He soon knighted him, created him Viscount Rochester, gave him

the garter, brought him into the privy council, and, though at first

without assigning him any particular office, bestowed on him the supreme

direction of all his business and political concerns. Agreeable to this

rapid advancement in confidence and honor, were the riches heaped upon the

needy favorite; and while Salisbury and all the wisest ministers could

scarcely find expedients sufficient to keep in motion the overburdened

machine of government, James, with unsparing hand, loaded with treasures

this insignificant and useless pageant.[*]

 

It is said, that the king found his pupil so ill educated as to be

ignorant even of the lowest rudiments of the Latin tongue; and that the

monarch, laying aside the sceptre, took the birch into his royal hand, and

instructed him in the principles of grammar. During the intervals of this

noble occupation, affairs of state, would be introduced; and the

stripling, by the ascendant which he had acquired, was now enabled to

repay on political, what he had received in grammatical instruction. Such

scenes, and such incidents, are the more ridiculous, though the less

odious, as the passion of James seems not to have contained in it any

thing criminal or flagitious. History charges herself willingly with a

relation of the great crimes, and still more with that of the great

virtues, of mankind; but she appears to fall from her dignity, when

necessitated to dwell on such frivolous events and ignoble personages.

 

The favorite was not, at first, so intoxicated with advancement, as not to

be sensible of his own ignorance and inexperience. He had recourse to the

assistance and advice of a friend; and he was more fortunate in his choice

than is usual with such pampered minions. In Sir Thomas Overbury he met

with a judicious and sincere counsellor; who, building all hopes of his

own preferment on that of the young favorite, endeavored to instil into

him the principles of prudence and discretion. By zealously serving every

body, Carre was taught to abate the envy which might attend his sudden

elevation: by showing a preference for the English, he learned to escape

the prejudices which prevailed against his country. And so long as he was

content to be ruled by Overbury’s friendly counsels, he enjoyed—what

is rare—the highest favor of the prince, without being hated by the

people.

 

To complete the measure of courtly happiness, nought was wanting but a

kind mistress; and, where high fortune concurred with all the graces of

youth and beauty, this circumstance could not be difficult to attain. But

it was here that the favorite met with that rock on which all his fortunes

were wrecked, and which plunged him forever into an abyss of infamy,

guilt, and misery.

 

No sooner had James mounted the throne of England, than he remembered his

friendship for the unfortunate families of Howard and Devereux, who had

suffered for their attachment to the cause of Mary and to his own. Having

restored young Essex to his blood and dignity, and conferred the titles of

Suffolk and Northampton on two brothers of the house of Norfolk, he sought

the further pleasure of uniting these families by the marriage of the earl

of Essex with Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk. She

was only thirteen, he fourteen years of age; and it was thought proper,

till both should attain the age of puberty that he should go abroad, and

pass some time in his travels.[*] He returned into England after four

years’ absence, and was pleased to find his countess in the full lustre of

beauty, and possessed of the love and admiration of the whole court. But,

when the earl approached, and claimed the privileges of a husband, he met

with nothing but symptoms of aversion and disgust, and a flat refusal of

any further familiarities. He applied to her parents, who constrained her

to attend him into the country, and to partake of his bed: but nothing

could overcome her rigid sullenness and obstinacy; and she still rose from

his side without having shared the nuptial pleasures. Disgusted with

reiterated denials, he at last gave over the pursuit, and separating

himself from her, thenceforth abandoned her conduct to her own will and

discretion.

 

Such coldness and aversion in Lady Essex arose not without an attachment

to another object. The favorite had opened his addresses, and had been too

successful in making impression on the tender heart of the young

countess.[**] She imagined that, so long as she refused the embraces of

Essex, she never could be deemed his wife; and that a separation and

divorce might still open the way for a new marriage with her beloved

Rochester.[***] Though their passion was so violent, and their

opportunities of intercourse so frequent, that they had already indulged

themselves in all the gratifications of love, they still lamented their

unhappy fate, while the union between them was not entire and

indissoluble. And the lover, as well as his mistress, was impatient till

their mutual ardor should be crowned by marriage.

 

So momentous an affair could not be concluded without consulting Overbury,

with whom Rochester was accustomed to share all his secrets. While that

faithful friend had considered his patron’s attachment to the countess of

Essex merely as an affair of gallantry, he had favored its progress; and

it was partly owing to the ingenious and passionate letters which he

dictated, that Rochester had met with such success in his addresses. Like

an experienced courtier, he thought that a conquest of this nature would

throw a lustre on the young favorite, and would tend still further to

endear him to James, who was charmed to hear of the amours of his court,

and listened with attention to every tale of gallantry. But great was

Overbury’s alarm, when Rochester mentioned his design of marrying the

countess; and he used every method to dissuade his friend from so foolish

an attempt. He represented how invidious, how difficult an enterprise to

procure her a divorce from her husband: how dangerous, how shameful, to

take into his own bed a profligate woman, who, being married to a young

nobleman of the first rank, had not scrupled to prostitute her character,

and to bestow favors on the object of a capricious and momentary passion.

And in the zeal of friendship, he went so far as to threaten Rochester,

that he would separate himself forever from him, if he could so far forget

his honor and his interest as to prosecute the intended marriage.[*]

 

Rochester had the weakness to reveal this conversation to the countess of

Essex; and when her rage and fury broke out against Overbury, he had also

the weakness to enter into her vindictive projects, and to swear vengeance

against his friend, for the utmost instance which he could receive of his

faithful friendship. Some contrivance was necessary for the execution of

their purpose. Rochester addressed himself to the king; and after

complaining, that his own indulgence to Overbury had begotten in him a

degree of arrogance which was extremely disagreeable, he procured a

commission for his embassy to Russia; which he represented as a retreat

for his friend, both profitable and honorable. When consulted by Overbury,

he earnestly dissuaded him from accepting this offer, and took on himself

the office of satisfying the king, if he should be anywise displeased with

the refusal.[**] To the king again, he aggravated the insolence of

Overbury’s conduct, and obtained a warrant for committing him to the

Tower, which James intended as a slight punishment for his disobedience.

The lieutenant of the Tower was a creature of Rochester’s, and had lately

been put into the office for this very purpose: he confined Overbury so

strictly, that the unhappy prisoner was debarred the sight even of his

nearest relations, and no communication of any kind was allowed with him

during near six months which he lived in prison.

 

This obstacle being removed, the lovers pursued their purpose; and the

king himself, forgetting the dignity of his character, and his friendship

for the family of Essex, entered zealously into the project of procuring

the countess a divorce from her husband. Essex also embraced the

opportunity of separating himself from a bad woman, by whom he was hated;

and he was willing to favor their success by any honorable expedient. The

pretence for a divorce was his incapacity to fulfil the conjugal duties;

and he confessed that, with regard to the countess, he was conscious of

such an infirmity, though he was not sensible of it with regard to any

other woman. In her place, too, it is said, a young virgin was substituted

under a mask, to undergo a legal inspection by a jury of matrons. After

such a trial, seconded by court influence, and supported by the ridiculous

opinion of fascination or witchcraft, the sentence of divorce was

pronounced between the earl of Essex and his countess.[*] And, to crown

the scene, the king, solicitous lest the lady should lose any rank by her

new marriage, bestowed on his minion the title of earl of Somerset.

 

Notwithstanding this success, the countess of Somerset was not satisfied

till she should further satiate her revenge on Overbury: and she engaged

her husband, as well as her uncle, the earl of Northampton, in the

atrocious design of taking him off secretly by poison. Fruitless attempts

were reiterated by weak poisons; but at last they gave him one so sudden

and violent, that the symptoms were apparent to every one who approached

him.[**] His interment was hurried on with the greatest precipitation; and

though a strong suspicion immediately prevailed in the public, the full

proof of the crime was not brought to light till some years after.

 

The fatal catastrophe of Overbury increased or begot the suspicion that

the prince of Wales had been carried off by poison given him by Somerset.

Men considered not that the contrary inference was much juster. If

Somerset was so great a novice in this detestable art, that, during the

course of five months, a man who was his prisoner and attended by none but

his emissaries, could not be despatched but in so bungling a manner, how

could it be imagined, that a young prince, living in his own court,

surrounded by his own friends and domestics, could be exposed to

Somerset’s attempts, and be taken off by so subtile a poison, if such a

one exist, as could elude the skill of the most experienced physicians?

 

The ablest minister that James ever possessed, the earl of Salisbury, was

dead.[*] Suffolk, a man of slender capacity, had succeeded him in his

office; and it was now his task to supply, from an exhausted treasury, the

profusion of James and of his young favorite. The title of baronet,

invented by Salisbury, was sold; and two hundred patents of that species

of knighthood were disposed of for so many thousand pounds; each rank of

nobility had also its price affixed to it:[**] privy seals were circulated

to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds: benevolences were exacted to

the amount of fifty-two thousand pounds:[***] and some monopolies, of no

great value, were erected. But all these expedients proved insufficient to

supply the king’s necessities; even though he began to enter into some

schemes for retrenching his expenses.[****] However small the hopes of

success, a new parliament must be summoned, and this dangerous expedient—for

such it was now become—once more be put to trial.

 

1614.

 

When the commons were assembled, they discovered an extraordinary alarm,

on account of the rumor which was spread abroad concerning

“undertakers.”[v] It was reported, that several persons, attached to the

king, had entered into a confederacy; and having laid a regular plan for

the new elections, had distributed their interest all over England, and

had undertaken to secure a majority for the court. So ignorant were the

commons, that they knew not this incident to be the first infallible

symptom of any regular or established liberty. Had they been contented to

follow the maxims of their predecessors, who, as the earl of Salisbury

said to the last parliament, never, but thrice in six hundred years,

refused a supply,[v*] they needed not dread that the crown should ever

interest itself in their elections. Formerly the kings even insisted, that

none of their household should be elected members; and though the charter

was afterwards declared void, Henry VI., from his great favor to the city

of York, conferred a peculiar privilege on its citizens, that they should

be exempted from this trouble.[v**]

 

It is well known, that, in ancient times, a seat in the house being

considered as a burden, attended neither with honor nor profit, it was

requisite for the counties and boroughs to pay fees to their

representatives. About this time, a seat began to be regarded as an honor,

and the country gentlemen contended for it; though the practice of levying

wages for the parliament men was not altogether discontinued. It was not

till long after, when liberty was thoroughly established, and popular

assemblies entered into every branch of public business, that the members

began to join profit to honor, and the crown found it necessary to

distribute among them all the considerable offices of the kingdom.

 

So little skill, or so small means, had the courtiers in James’s reign for

managing elections, that this house of commons showed rather a stronger

spirit of liberty than the foregoing; and instead of entering upon the

business of supply, as urged by the king, who made them several liberal

offers of grace,[*] they immediately resumed the subject which had been

opened last parliament, and disputed his majesty’s power of levying new

customs and impositions, by the mere authority of his prerogative. It is

remarkable, that, in their debates on this subject, the courtiers

frequently pleaded, as a precedent, the example of all the other

hereditary monarchs in Europe, and particularly mentioned the kings of

France and Spain; nor was this reasoning received by the house either with

surprise or indignation.[**] The members of the opposite party either

contented themselves with denying the justness of the inference, or they

disputed the truth of the observation.[***] And a patriot member in

particular, Sir Roger Owen, even in arguing against the impositions,

frankly allowed, that the king of England was endowed with as ample a

power and prerogative as any prince in Christendom.[****] The nations on

the continent, we may observe, enjoyed still, in that age, some small

remains of liberty; and the English were possessed of little more.

 

The commons applied to the lords for a conference with regard to the new

impositions. A speech of Neile, bishop of Lincoln, reflecting on the lower

house, begat some altercation with the peers;[*] 53 and the king seized the

opportunity of dissolving, immediately, with great indignation, a

parliament which had shown so firm a resolution of retrenching his

prerogative, without communicating, in return, the smallest supply to his

necessities. He carried his resentment so far, as even to throw into

prison some of the members who had been the most forward in their

opposition to his measures.[**] In vain did he plead, in excuse for this

violence, the example of Elizabeth, and other princes of the line of

Tudor, as well as Plantagenet. The people and the parliament, without

abandoning forever all their liberties and privileges, could acquiesce in

none of these precedents, how ancient and frequent soever. And were the

authority of such precedents admitted, the utmost that could be inferred

is, that the constitution of England was, at that time, an inconsistent

fabric, whose jarring and discordant parts must soon destroy each other,

and from the dissolution of the old, beget some new form of civil

government, more uniform and consistent.

 

In the public and avowed conduct of the king and the house of commons,

throughout this whole reign, there appears sufficient cause of quarrel and

mutual disgust; yet are we not to imagine that this was the sole

foundation of that jealousy which prevailed between them. During debates

in the house, it often happened that a particular member, more ardent and

zealous than the rest, would display the highest sentiments of liberty,

which the commons contented themselves to hear with silence and seeming

approbation; and the king, informed of these harangues, concluded the

whole house to be infected with the same principles, and to be engaged in

a combination against his prerogative. The king, on the other hand, though

he valued himself extremely on his kingcraft, and perhaps was not

altogether incapable of dissimulation, seems to have been very little

endowed with the gift of secrecy; but openly at his table, in all

companies, inculcated those monarchical tenets which he had so strongly

imbibed. Before a numerous audience, he had expressed himself with great

disparagement of the common law of England, and had given the preference,

in the strongest terms, to the civil law: and for this indiscretion he

found himself obliged to apologize, in a speech to the former

parliament.[*] As a specimen of his usual liberty of talk, we may mention

a story, though it passed some time after, which we meet with in the life

of Waller, and which that poet used frequently to repeat. When Waller was

young, he had the curiosity to go to court; and he stood in the circle,

and saw James dine; where, among other company, there sat at table two

bishops, Neile and Andrews. The king proposed aloud this question, Whether

he might not take his subjects’ money, when he needed it, without all this

formality of parliament? Neile replied, “God forbid you should not: for

you are the breath of our nostrils.” Andrews declined answering, and said

he was not skilled in parliamentary cases: but upon the king’s urging him,

and saying he would admit of no evasion, the bishop replied pleasantly,

“Why, then, I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother Neile’s

money; for he offers it.”[**]

 

1615.

 

The favorite had hitherto escaped the inquiry of justice; but he had not

escaped that still voice which can make itself be heard amidst all the

hurry and flattery of a court, and astonishes the criminal with a just

representation of his most secret enormities. Conscious of the murder of

his friend, Somerset received small consolation from the enjoyments of

love, or the utmost kindness and indulgence of his sovereign. The graces

of his youth gradually disappeared, the gayety of his manners was

obscured, his politeness and obliging behavior were changed into

sullenness and silence. And the king, whose affections had been engaged by

these superficial accomplishments, began to estrange himself from a man

who no longer contributed to his amusement.

 

The sagacious courtiers observed the first symptoms of this disgust:

Somerset’s enemies seized the opportunity, and offered a new minion to the

king. George Villiers, a youth of one-and-twenty, younger brother of a

good family, returned at this time from his travels, and was remarked for

the advantages of a handsome person, genteel air, and fashionable apparel.

At a comedy, he was purposely placed full in James’s eye, and immediately

engaged the attention, and, in the same instant, the affections of that

monarch.[***] Ashamed of his sudden attachment, the king endeavored, but

in vain, to conceal the partiality which he felt for the handsome

stranger; and he employed all his profound politics to fix him in his

service, without seeming to desire it.

 

He declared his resolution not to confer any office on him, unless

entreated by the queen; and he pretended, that it should only be in

complaisance to her choice he would agree to admit him near his person.

The queen was immediately applied to; but she, well knowing the extreme to

which the king carried these attachments, refused, at first, to lend her

countenance to this new passion. It was not till entreated by Abbot,

archbishop of Canterbury, a decent prelate, and one much prejudiced

against Somerset, that she would condescend to oblige her husband, by

asking this favor of him.[*] And the king, thinking now that all

appearances were fully saved, no longer constrained his affection, but

immediately bestowed the office of cup-bearer on young Villiers.

 

The whole court was thrown into parties between the two minions: while

some endeavored to advance the rising fortunes of Villiers, others deemed

it safer to adhere to the established credit of Somerset. The king

himself, divided between inclination and decorum, increased the doubt and

ambiguity of the courtiers; and the stern jealousy of the old favorite,

who refused every advance of friendship from his rival, begat perpetual

quarrels between their several partisans. But the discovery of Somerset’s

guilt in the murder of Overbury at last decided the controversy, and

exposed him to the ruin and infamy which he so well merited.

 

An apothecary’s apprentice, who had been employed in making up the

poisons, having retired to Flushing, began to talk very freely of the

whole secret; and the affair at last came to the ears of Trumbal, the

king’s envoy in the Low Countries. By his means, Sir Ralph Winwood,

secretary of state, was informed; and he immediately carried the

intelligence to James. The king, alarmed and astonished to find such

enormous guilt in a man whom he had admitted into his bosom, sent for Sir

Edward Coke, chief justice, and earnestly recommended to him the most

rigorous and unbiased scrutiny. This injunction was executed with great

industry and severity: the whole labyrinth of guilt was carefully

unravelled: the lesser criminals, Sir Jervis Elvis, lieutenant of the

Tower, Franklin, Weston, Mrs. Turner, were first tried and condemned:

Somerset and his countess were afterwards found guilty. Northampton’s

death, a little before, had saved him from a like fate.

 

It may not be unworthy of remark, that Coke, in the trial of Mrs. Turner,

told her that she was guilty of the seven deadly sins: she was a whore, a

bawd, a sorcerer, a witch, a Papist, a felon, and a murderer.[*] And, what

may more surprise us, Bacon, then attorney-general, took care to observe,

that poisoning was a Popish trick.[**] Such were the bigoted prejudices

which prevailed: poisoning was not of itself sufficiently odious, if it

were not represented as a branch of Popery. Stowe tells us, that when the

king came to Newcastle, on his first entry into England, he gave liberty

to all the prisoners, except those who were confined for treason, murder,

and Papistry. When one considers these circumstances, that furious bigotry

of the Catholics which broke out in the gunpowder conspiracy, appears the

less surprising.

 

All the accomplices in Overbury’s murder received the punishment due to

their crime: but the king bestowed a pardon on the principals, Somerset

and the countess. It must be confessed, that James’s fortitude had been

highly laudable, had he persisted in his first intention of consigning

over to severe justice all the criminals: but let us still beware of

blaming him too harshly, if, on the approach of the fatal hour, he

scrupled to deliver into the hands of the executioner persons whom he had

once favored with his most tender affections. To soften the rigor of their

fate, after some years’ imprisonment, he restored them to their liberty,

and conferred on them a pension, with which they retired, and languished

out old age in infamy and obscurity. Their guilty loves were turned into

the most deadly hatred; and they passed many years together in the same

house, without any intercourse or correspondence with each other.[***]

 

Several historians,[****] in relating these events, have insisted much on

the dissimulation of James’s behavior, when he delivered Somerset into the

hands of the chief justice; on the insolent menaces of that criminal; on

his peremptory refusal to stand a trial; and on the extreme anxiety of the

king during the whole progress of this affair.

 

Allowing all these circumstances to be true, of which some are suspicious,

if not palpably false,[*] the great remains of tenderness which James

still felt for Somerset, may, perhaps, be sufficient to account for them.

That favorite was high-spirited, and resolute rather to perish than live

under the infamy to which he was exposed. James was sensible, that the

pardoning of so great a criminal, which was of itself invidious, would

become still more unpopular, if his obstinate and stubborn behavior on his

trial should augment the public hatred against him.[**] At least, the

unreserved confidence in which the king had indulged his favorite for

several years, might render Somerset master of so many secrets, that it is

impossible, without further light, to assign the particular reason of that

superiority which, it is said, he appeared so much to assume.

 

The fall of Somerset, and his banishment from court, opened the way for

Villiers to mount up at once to the full height of favor, of honors, and

of riches. Had James’s passion been governed by common rules of prudence,

the office of cup-bearer would have attached Villiers to his person, and

might well have contented one of his age and family; nor would any one,

who was not cynically austere, have much censured the singularity of the

king’s choice in his friends and favorites. But such advancement was far

inferior to the fortune which he intended for his minion. In the course of

a few years, he created him Viscount Villiers, earl, marquis, and duke of

Buckingham, knight of the garter, master of the horse, chief justice in

eyre, warden of the cinque ports, master of the king’s bench office,

steward of Westminster, constable of Windsor, and lord high admiral of

England. His mother obtained the title of countess of Buckingham: his

brother was created Viscount Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy

relations were all pushed up into credit and authority. And thus the fond

prince, while he meant to play the tutor to his favorite, and to train him

up in the rules of prudence and politics, took an infallible method, by

loading him with premature and exorbitant honors, to render him, forever,

rash, precipitate, and insolent.

 

1616.

 

A young minion to gratify with pleasure, a necessitous family to supply

with riches, were enterprises too great for the empty exchequer of James.

In order to obtain a little money, the cautionary towns must be delivered

up to the Dutch; a measure which has been severely blamed by almost all

historians; and I may venture to affirm, that it has been censured much

beyond its real weight and importance.

 

When Queen Elizabeth advanced money for the support of the infant

republic, besides the view of securing herself against the power and

ambition of Spain, she still reserved the prospect of reimbursement; and

she got consigned into her hands the three important fortresses of

Flushing, the Brille, and Rammekins, as pledges for the money due to her.

Indulgent to the necessitous condition of the states, she agreed that the

debt should bear no interest; and she stipulated, that if ever England

should make a separate peace with Spain, she should pay the troops which

garrisoned those fortresses.[*]

 

After the truce was concluded between Spain and the United Provinces, the

states made an agreement with the king, that the debt, which then amounted

to eight hundred thousand pounds, should be discharged by yearly payments

of forty thousand pounds; and as five years had elapsed, the debt was now

reduced to six hundred thousand pounds; and in fifteen years more, if the

truce were renewed, it would be finally extinguished.[**]

 

But of this sum, twenty-six thousand pounds a year were expended on the

pay of the garrisons: the remainder alone accrued to the king: and the

states, weighing these circumstances, thought that they made James a very

advantageous offer, when they expressed their willingness, on the

surrender of the cautionary towns to pay him immediately two hundred and

fifty thousand pounds, and to incorporate the English garrisons in their

army. It occurred also to the king, that even the payment of the forty

thousand pounds a year was precarious, and depended on the accident that

the truce should be renewed between Spain and the republic: if war broke

out, the maintenance of the garrisons lay upon England alone; a burden

very useless, and too heavy for the slender revenues of that kingdom: that

even during the truce, the Dutch, straitened by other expenses, were far

from being regular in their payments; and the garrisons were at present in

danger of mutinying for want of subsistence: that the annual sum of

fourteen thousand pounds, the whole saving on the Dutch payments,

amounted, in fifteen years, to no more than two hundred and ten thousand

pounds; whereas two hundred and fifty thousand pounds were offered

immediately, a larger sum; and if money be computed at ten per cent., the

current interest more than double the sum to which England was

entitled:[*] that if James waited till the whole debt were discharged, the

troops which composed the garrisons remained a burden upon him, and could

not be broken, without receiving some consideration for their past

services: that the cautionary towns were only a temporary restraint upon

the Hollanders; and, in the present emergence, the conjunction of interest

between England and the republic was so intimate as to render all other

ties superfluous; and no reasonable measures for mutual support would be

wanting from the Dutch, even though freed from the dependence of these

garrisons: that the exchequer of the republic was at present very low,

insomuch that they found difficulty, now that the aids of France were

withdrawn, to maintain themselves in that posture of defence which was

requisite during the truce with Spain: and that the Spaniards were

perpetually insisting with the king on the restitution of these towns, as

belonging to their crown; and no cordial alliance could ever be made with

that nation, while they remained in the hands of the English.[**] These

reasons, together with his urgent wants, induced the king to accept of

Caron’s offer; and he evacuated the cautionary towns, which held the

states in a degree of subjection, and which an ambitious and enterprising

prince would have regarded as his most valuable possessions. This is the

date of the full liberty of the Dutch commonwealth.

 

1617.

 

When the crown of England devolved on James, it might have been foreseen

by the Scottish nation, that the independence of their kingdom, the object

for which their ancestors had shed so much blood, would now be lost; and

that, if both states persevered in maintaining separate laws and

parliaments, the weaker would more sensibly feel the subjection, than if

it had been totally subdued by force of arms. But these views did not

generally occur. The glory of having given a sovereign to their powerful

enemy, the advantages of present peace and tranquillity, the riches

acquired from the munificence of their master; these considerations

secured their dutiful obedience to a prince who daily gave such sensible

proofs of his friendship and partiality towards them. Never had the

authority of any king who resided among them, been so firmly established

as was that of James, even when absent; and as the administration had been

hitherto conducted with great order and tranquillity, there had happened

no occurrence to draw thither our attention. But this summer the king was

resolved to pay a visit to his native country, in order to renew his

ancient friendships and connections, and to introduce that change of

ecclesiastical discipline and government on which he was extremely intent.

The three chief points of this kind, which James proposed to accomplish by

his journey to Scotland, were the enlarging of episcopal authority, the

establishing of a few ceremonies in public worship, and the fixing of a

superiority in the civil above the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

 

But it is an observation suggested by all history, and by none more than

by that of James and his successor, that the religious spirit, when it

mingles with faction, contains in it something supernatural and

unaccountable; and that, in its operations upon society, effects

correspond less to their known causes than is found in any other

circumstance of government; a reflection which may at once afford a source

of blame against such sovereigns as lightly innovate in so dangerous an

article, and of apology for such as, being engaged in an enterprise of

that nature, are disappointed of the expected event, and fail in their

undertakings.

 

When the Scottish nation was first seized with that zeal for reformation,

which, though it caused such disturbance during the time, has proved so

salutary in the consequences, the preachers, assuming a character little

inferior to the prophetic or apostolical, disdained all subjection to the

spiritual rulers of the church, by whom their innovations were punished

and opposed. The revenues of the dignified clergy, no longer considered as

sacred, were either appropriated by the present possessors, or seized by

the more powerful barons; and what remained, after mighty dilapidations,

was, by act of parliament, annexed to the crown. The prelates, however,

and abbots, maintained their temporal jurisdictions and their seats in

parliament; and though laymen were sometimes endowed with ecclesiastical

titles, the church, notwithstanding its frequent protestations to the

contrary, was still supposed to be represented by those spiritual lords in

the states of the kingdom. After many struggles, the king, even before his

accession to the throne of England, had acquired sufficient influence over

the Scottish clergy, to extort from them an acknowledgment of the

parliamentary jurisdiction of bishops; though attended with many

precautions, in order to secure themselves against the spiritual

encroachments of that order.[*] When king of England, he engaged them,

though still with great reluctance on their part, to advance a step

further, and to receive the bishops as perpetual presidents or moderators

in their ecclesiastical synods; reiterating their protestations against

all spiritual jurisdiction of the prelates, and all controlling power over

the presbyters.[**] And by such gradual innovations, the king flattered

himself that he should quietly introduce episcopal authority: but as his

final scope was fully seen from the beginning, every new advance gave

fresh occasion of discontent, and aggravated, instead of softening, the

abhorrence entertained against the prelacy.

 

What rendered the king’s aim more apparent, were the endeavors which, at

the same time, he used to introduce into Scotland some of the ceremonies

of the church of England: the rest, it was easily foreseen, would soon

follow. The fire of devotion, excited by novelty, and inflamed by

opposition, had so possessed the minds of the Scottish reformers, that all

rites and ornaments, and even order of worship, were disdainfully rejected

as useless burdens; retarding the imagination in its rapturous ecstasies,

and cramping the operations of that divine spirit by which they supposed

themselves to be animated. A mode of worship was established, the most

naked and most simple imaginable; one that borrowed nothing from the

senses, but reposed itself entirely on the contemplation of that divine

essence which discovers itself to the understanding only. This species of

devotion, so worthy of the Supreme Being, but so little suitable to human

frailty, was observed to occasion great disturbances in the breast, and in

many respects to confound all rational principles of conduct and behavior.

The mind, straining for these extraordinary raptures, reaching them by

short glances, sinking again under its own weakness, rejecting all

exterior aid of pomp and ceremony, was so occupied in this inward life,

that It fled from every intercourse of society, and from every cheerful

amusement which could soften or humanize the character. It was obvious to

all discerning eyes, and had not escaped the king’s, that, by the

prevalence of fanaticism, a gloomy and sullen disposition established

itself among the people; a spirit obstinate and dangerous; independent and

disorderly; animated equally with a contempt of authority, and a hatred to

every other mode of religion, particularly to the Catholic. In order to

mellow these humors, James endeavored to infuse a small tincture of

ceremony into the national worship, and to introduce such rites as might,

in some degree, occupy the mind, and please the senses, without departing

too far from that simplicity by which the reformation was distinguished.

The finer arts too, though still rude in these northern kingdoms, were

employed to adorn the churches; and the king’s chapel, in which an organ

was erected, and some pictures and statues displayed, was proposed as a

model to the rest of the nation. But music was grating to the prejudiced

ears of the Scottish; clergy; sculpture and painting appeared instruments

of idolatry the surplice was a rag of Popery; and every motion or gesture

prescribed by the liturgy, was a step towards that spiritual Babylon, so

much the object of their horror and aversion. Every thing was deemed

impious but their own mystical comments on the Scriptures, which they

idolized, and whose Eastern prophetic style they employed in every common

occurrence.

 

It will not be necessary to give a particular account of the ceremonies

which the king was so intent to establish. Such institutions, for a time,

are esteemed either too divine to have proceeded from any other being than

the Supreme Creator of the universe, or too diabolical to have been

derived from any but an infernal demon. But no sooner is the mode of the

controversy past, than they are universally discovered to be of so little

importance, as scarcely to be mentioned with decency amidst the ordinary

course of human transactions. It suffices here to remark, that the rites

introduced by James regarded the kneeling at the sacrament, private

communion, private baptism, confirmation of children, and the observance

of Christmas and other festivals.[*]

 

The acts establishing these ceremonies were afterwards known by the name

of the Articles of Perth, from the place where they were ratified by the

assembly.

 

A conformity of discipline and worship between the churches of England and

Scotland, which was James’s aim, he never could hope to establish, but by

first procuring an acknowledgment of his own authority in all spiritual

causes; and nothing could be more contrary to the practice as well as

principles of the Presbyterian clergy. The ecclesiastical courts possessed

the power of pronouncing excommunication; and that sentence, besides the

spiritual consequences supposed to follow from it, was attended with

immediate effects of the most important nature. The person excommunicated

was shunned by every one as profane and impious; and his whole estate,

during his lifetime, and all his movables, forever, were forfeited to the

crown. Nor were the previous steps requisite before pronouncing this

sentence, formal or regular, in proportion to the weight of it. Without

accuser, without summons, without trial, any ecclesiastical court, however

inferior, sometimes pretended, in a summary manner, to denounce

excommunication, for any cause, and against any person, even though he

lived not within the bounds of their jurisdiction.[*] And, by this means,

the whole tyranny of the inquisition, though without its order, was

introduced into the kingdom.

 

But the clergy were not content with the unlimited jurisdiction which they

exercised in ecclesiastical matters: they assumed a censorial power over

every part of administration; and, in all their sermons, and even prayers,

mingling politics with religion, they inculcated the most seditious and

most turbulent principles. Black, minister of St. Andrew’s, went so

far,[**] in a sermon, as to pronounce all kings the devil’s children; he

gave the queen of England the appellation of atheist; he said, that the

treachery of the king’s heart was now fully discovered; and in his prayers

for the queen he used these words: “We must pray for her for the fashion’s

sake, but we have no cause: she will never do us any good.” When summoned

before the privy council, he refused to answer to a civil court for any

thing delivered from the pulpit, even though the crime of which he was

accused was of a civil nature. The church adopted his cause. They raised a

sedition in Edinburgh.[***]

 

The king, during some time, was in the hands of the enraged populace; and

it was not without courage, as well as dexterity, that he was able to

extricate himself.[*] A few days after, a minister, preaching in the

principal church of that capital, said, that the king was possessed with a

devil; and that, one devil being expelled, seven worse had entered in his

place.[**] To which he added, that the subjects might lawfully rise, and

take the sword out of his hand. Scarcely, even during the darkest night of

Papal superstition, are there found such instances of priestly

encroachments, as the annals of Scotland present to us during that period.

 

By these extravagant stretches of power, and by the patient conduct of

James, the church began to lose ground, even before the king’s accession

to the throne of England; but no sooner had that event taken place, than

he made the Scottish clergy sensible that he was become the sovereign of a

great kingdom, which he governed with great, authority. Though formerly he

would have thought himself happy to have made a fair partition with them

of the civil and ecclesiastical authority, he was now resolved to exert a

supreme jurisdiction in church as well as state, and to put an end to

their seditious practices. An assembly had been summoned at Aberdeen;[***]

but, on account of his journey to London, he prorogued it to the year

following. Some of the clergy, disavowing his ecclesiastical supremacy,

met at the time first appointed, notwithstanding his prohibition. He threw

them into prison. Such of them as submitted, and acknowledged their error,

were pardoned. The rest were brought to their trial. They were condemned

for high treason. The king gave them their lives, but banished them the

kingdom. Six of them suffered this penalty.[****]

 

The general assembly was afterwards induced[v] to acknowledge the king’s

authority in summoning ecclesiastical courts, and to submit to the

jurisdiction and visitation of the bishops Even their favorite sentence of

excommunication was declared invalid, unless confirmed by the ordinary.

The king recommended to the inferior courts the members whom they should

elect to this assembly; and every thing was conducted in it with little

appearance of choice and liberty.[v*]

 

By his own prerogative, likewise, which he seems to have stretched on this

occasion, the king erected a court of high commission,[*] in imitation of

that which was established in England. The bishops and a few of the

clergy, who had been summoned, willingly acknowledged this court; and it

proceeded immediately upon business, as if its authority had been grounded

on the full consent of the whole legislature.

 

But James reserved the final blow for the time when he should himself pay

a visit to Scotland. He proposed to the parliament, which was then

assembled, that they should enact, that “whatever his majesty should

determine in the external government of the church, with the consent of

the archbishops, bishops, and a competent number of the ministry, should

have the force of law.”[**] What number should be deemed competent was not

determined; and their nomination was left entirely to the king: so that

his ecclesiastical authority, had this bill passed, would have been

established in its full extent. Some of the clergy protested. They

apprehended, they said, that the purity of their church would, by means of

this new authority, be polluted with all the rites and liturgy of the

church of England. James, dreading clamor and opposition dropped the bill,

which had already passed the lords of articles; and asserted, that the

inherent prerogative of the crown contained more power than was recognized

by it. Some time after, he called, at St. Andrew’s, a meeting of the

bishops and thirty-six of the most eminent clergy. He there declared his

resolution of exerting his prerogative, and of establishing, by his own

authority, the few ceremonies which he had recommended to them. They

entreated him rather to summon a general assembly, and to gain their

assent. An assembly was accordingly summoned to meet on the twenty-fifth

of November ensuing.

 

Yet this assembly, which met after the king’s departure from Scotland,

eluded all his applications; and it was not till the subsequent year, that

he was able to procure a vote for receiving his ceremonies. And through

every step in this affair, in the parliament as well as in all the general

assemblies, the nation betrayed the utmost reluctance to all these

innovations, and nothing but James’s importunity and authority had

extorted a seeming consent, which was belied by the inward sentiments of

all ranks of people. Even the few over whom religious prejudices were not

prevalent, thought national honor sacrificed by a servile imitation of the

modes worship practised in England. And every prudent man agreed in

condemning the measures of the king, who, by an ill-timed zeal for

insignificant ceremonies, had betrayed, though in an opposite manner,

equal narrowness of mind with the persons whom he treated with such

contempt. It was judged that, had not these dangerous humors been

irritated by opposition; had they been allowed peaceably to evaporate;

they would at last have subsided within the limits of law and civil

authority; and that, as all fanatical religions naturally circumscribe to

very narrow bounds the numbers and riches of the ecclesiastics, no sooner

is their first fire spent, than they lose their credit over the people,

and leave them under the natural and beneficent influence of their civil

and moral obligations.

 

At the same time that James shocked, in so violent a manner, the religious

principles of his Scottish subjects, he acted in opposition to those of

his English. He had observed, in his progress through England, that a

Judaical observance of the Sunday, chiefly by means of the Puritans, was

every day gaining ground throughout the kingdom; and that the people,

under color of religion, were, contrary to former practice debarred such

sports, and recreations as contributed both to their health and their

amusement.[*] Festivals, which, in other nations and ages, are partly

dedicated to public worship, partly to mirth and society, were here

totally appropriated to the offices of religion, and served to nourish

those sullen and gloomy contemplations to which the people were, of

themselves, so unfortunately subject. The king imagined, that it would be

easy to infuse cheerfulness into this dark spirit of devotion. He issued a

proclamation to allow and encourage, after divine service, all kinds of

lawful games and exercises; and, by his authority, he endeavored to give

sanction to a practice which his subjects regarded as the utmost instance

of profaneness and impiety.[**]

 

To show how rigid the English, chiefly the Puritans, were become in this

particular, a bill was introduced into the house of commons, in the

eighteenth of the king, for the more strict observance of the Sunday,

which they affected to the Sabbath. One Shepherd opposed this bill,

objected to the appellation of Sabbath as Puritanical, defended dancing by

the example of David, and seems even to have justified sports on that day.

For this profaneness he was expelled the house, by the suggestion of Mr.

Pym the house of lords opposed so far this Puritanical spirit of the

commons that they proposed that the appellation of Sabbath should be

changed into that of the
