The grievances under which the English labored when considered in

themselves, without regard to the constitution, scarcely deserve the name;

nor were they either burdensome on the people’s properties, or anywise

shocking to the natural humanity of mankind. Even the imposition of ship

money, independent of the consequences, was a great and evident advantage

to the public, by the judicious use which the king made of the money

levied by that expedient. And though it was justly apprehended, that such

precedents, if patiently submitted to, would end in a total disuse of

parliaments, and in the establishment of arbitrary authority, Charles

dreaded no opposition from the people, who are not commonly much affected

with consequences, and require some striking motive to engage them in a

resistance of established government. All ecclesiastical affairs were

settled by law and uninterrupted precedent; and the church was become a

considerable barrier to the power, both legal and illegal, of the crown.

Peace too, industry, commerce, opulence; nay, even justice and lenity of

administration, notwithstanding some very few exceptions; all these were

enjoyed by the people; and every other blessing of government, except

liberty, or rather the present exercise of liberty and its proper

security.[*] It seemed probable, therefore, that affairs might long have

continued on the same footing in England, had it not been for the

neighborhood of Scotland; a country more turbulent, and less disposed to

submission and obedience. It was thence the commotions first arose; and is

therefore time for us to return thither, and to give an account of the

state of affairs in that kingdom.

 

Though the pacific, and not unskilful government of James, and the great

authority which he had acquired, had much allayed the feuds among the

great families, and had established law and order throughout the kingdom,

the Scottish nobility were still possessed of the chief power and

influence over the people. Their property was extensive; their hereditary

jurisdictions and the feudal tenures increased their authority; and the

attachment of the gentry to the heads of families established a kind of

voluntary servitude under the chieftains. Besides that long absence had

much loosened the King’s connections with the nobility, who resided

chiefly at their country seats, they were in general, at this time, though

from slight causes, much disgusted with the court. Charles, from the

natural piety or superstition of his temper, was extremely attached to the

ecclesiastics; and as it is natural for men to persuade themselves that

their interest coincides with their inclination, he had established it as

a fixed maxim of policy, to increase the power and authority of that

order. The prelates, he thought, established regularity and discipline

among the clergy; the clergy inculcated obedience and loyalty among the

people; and as that rank of men had no separate authority and no

dependence but on the crown, the royal power, it would seem, might with

the greater safety be intrusted in their hands. Many of the prelates,

therefore, were raised to the chief dignities of the state;[*] Spotswood,

archbishop of St. Andrews, was created chancellor: nine of the bishops

were privy councillors: the bishop of Ross aspired to the office of

treasurer: some of the prelates possessed places in the exchequer: and it

was even endeavored to revive the first institution of the college of

justice, and to share equally between the clergy and laity the whole

judicial authority.[**]

 

These advantages, possessed by the church, and which the bishops did not

always enjoy with suitable modesty, disgusted the haughty nobility, who,

deeming themselves much superior in rank and quality to this new order of

men, were displeased to find themselves inferior in power and influence.

Interest joined itself to ambition, and begat a jealousy lest the

episcopal sees, which at the reformation had been pillaged by the nobles,

should again be enriched at the expense of that order. By a most useful

and beneficial law, the impropriations had already been ravished from the

great men: competent salaries had been assigned to the impoverished clergy

from the tithes of each parish: and what remained, the proprietor of the

land was empowered to purchase at a low valuation.[*] The king likewise,

warranted by ancient law and practice, had declared for a general

resumption of all crown lands alienated by his predecessors; and though he

took no step towards the execution of this project, the very pretension to

such power had excited jealousy and discontent.[**]

 

Notwithstanding the tender regard which Charles bore to the whole church,

he had been able in Scotland to acquire only the affection of the superior

rank among the clergy. The ministers in general equalled, if not exceeded,

the nobility in their prejudices against the court, against the prelates,

and against episcopal authority.[***] Though the establishment of the

hierarchy might seem advantageous to the inferior clergy, both as it

erected dignities to which all of them might aspire, and as it bestowed a

lustre on the whole body, and allured men of family into it, these views

had no influence on the Scottish ecclesiastics. In the present disposition

of men’s minds, there was another circumstance which drew consideration,

and counterbalanced power and riches, the usual foundations of distinction

among men; and that was the fervor of piety, and the rhetoric, however

barbarous, of religious lectures and discourses. Checked by the prelates

in the license of preaching, the clergy regarded episcopal jurisdiction

both as a tyranny and a usurpation, and maintained a parity among

ecclesiastics to be a divine privilege, which no human law could alter or

infringe. While such ideas prevailed, the most moderate exercise of

authority would have given disgust; much more, that extensive power which

the king’s indulgence encouraged the prelates to assume. The jurisdiction

of presbyteries, synods, and other democratical courts, was in a manner

abolished by the bishops; and the general assembly itself had not been

summoned for several years.[****] A new oath was arbitrarily imposed on

intrants, by which they swore to observe the articles of Perth, and submit

to the liturgy and canons. And in a word, the whole system of church

government, during a course of thirty years, had been changed by means of

the innovations introduced by James and Charles.

 

The people, under the influence of the nobility and clergy, could not fail

to partake of the discontents which prevailed among these two orders; and

where real grounds of complaint were wanting, they greedily laid hold of

imaginary ones. The same horror against Popery with which the English

Puritans were possessed, was observable among the populace in Scotland;

and among these, as being more uncultivated and uncivilized, seemed rather

to be inflamed into a higher degree of ferocity. The genius of religion

which prevailed in the court and among the prelates, was of an opposite

nature; and having some affinity to the Romish worship, led them to

mollify, as much as possible, these severe prejudices, and to speak of the

Catholics in more charitable language, and with more reconciling

expressions. From this foundation a panic fear of Popery was easily

raised; and every new ceremony or ornament introduced into divine service,

was part of that great mystery of iniquity, which, from the encouragement

of the king and the bishops, was to overspread the nation.[*] The few

innovations which James had made, were considered as preparatives to this

grand design; and the further alterations attempted by Charles, were

represented as a plain declaration of his intentions. Through the whole

course of this reign, nothing had more fatal influence, in both kingdoms,

than this groundless apprehension, which with so much industry was

propagated, and with so much credulity was embraced, by all ranks of men.

 

Amidst these dangerous complaints and terrors of religious innovation, the

civil and ecclesiastical liberties of the nation were imagined, and with

some reason, not to be altogether free from invasion.

 

The establishment of the high commission by James, without any authority

of law, seemed a considerable encroachment of the crown, and erected the

most dangerous and arbitrary of all courts, by a method equally dangerous

and arbitrary. All the steps towards the settlement of Episcopacy had

indeed been taken with consent of parliament: the articles of Perth were

confirmed in 1621: in 1633, the king had obtained a general ratification

of every ecclesiastical establishment: but these laws had less authority

with the nation, as they were known to have passed contrary to the

sentiments even of those who voted for them, and were in reality extorted

by the authority and importunity of the sovereign. The means, however,

which both James and Charles had employed, in order to influence the

parliament, were entirely regular, and no reasonable pretence had been

afforded for representing these laws as null or invalid.

 

But there prevailed among the greater part of the nation another

principle, of the most important and most dangerous nature; and which, if

admitted, destroyed entirely the validity of all such statutes. The

ecclesiastical authority was supposed totally independent of the civil;

and no act of parliament, nothing but the consent of the church itself,

was represented as sufficient ground for the introduction of any change in

religious worship or discipline. And though James had obtained the vote of

assemblies for receiving Episcopacy and his new rites; it must be

confessed, that such irregularities had prevailed in constituting these

ecclesiastical courts, and such violence in conducting them, that there

were some grounds for denying the authority of all their acts. Charles,

sensible that an extorted consent, attended with such invidious

circumstances, would rather be prejudicial to his measures, had wholly

laid aside the use of assemblies, and was resolved, in conjunction with

the bishops, to govern the church by an authority to which he thought

himself fully entitled, and which he believed inherent in the crown.

 

The king’s great aim was to complete the work so happily begun by his

father; to establish discipline upon a regular system of canons, to

introduce a liturgy into public worship, and to render the ecclesiastical

government of all his kingdoms regular and uniform. Some views of policy

might move him to this undertaking; but his chief motives were derived

from principles of zeal and conscience.

 

The canons for establishing ecclesiastical jurisdiction were promulgated

in 1635; and were received by the nation, though without much appearing

opposition, yet with great inward apprehension and discontent. Men felt

displeasure at seeing the royal authority highly exalted by them, and

represented as absolute and uncontrollable. They saw these speculative

principles reduced to practice, and a whole body of ecclesiastical laws

established without any previous consent either of church or state.[*]

 

They dreaded lest, by a parity of reason, like arbitrary authority, from

like pretences and principles, would be assumed in civil matters: they

remarked, that the delicate boundaries which separate church and state

were already passed, and many civil ordinances established by the canons,

under color of ecclesiastical institutions: and they were apt to deride

the negligence with which these important edicts had been compiled, when

they found that the new liturgy or service-book was every where, under

severe penalties, enjoined by them, though it had not yet been composed or

published.[*] It was, however, soon expected; and in the reception of it,

as the people are always most affected by what is external and exposed to

the senses, it was apprehended that the chief difficulty would consist.

 

The liturgy which the king, from his own authority, imposed on Scotland,

was copied from that of England: but, lest a servile imitation might shock

the pride of his ancient kingdom, a few alterations, in order to save

appearances, were made in it; and in that shape it was transmitted to the

bishops at Edinburgh.[**] But the Scots had universally entertained a

notion, that, though riches and worldly glory had been shared out to them

with a sparing hand, they could boast of spiritual treasures more abundant

and more genuine than were enjoyed by any nation under heaven. Even their

southern neighbors, they thought, though separated from Rome, still

retained a great tincture of the primitive pollution; and their liturgy

was represented as a species of mass, though with some less show and

embroidery.[***] Great prejudices, therefore, were entertained against it,

even considered in itself; much more when regarded as a preparative, which

was soon to introduce into Scotland all the abominations of Popery. And as

the very few alterations which distinguished the new liturgy from the

English, seemed to approach nearer to the doctrine of the real presence,

this circumstance was deemed an undoubted confirmation of every suspicion

with which the people were possessed.[****]

 

Easter-day was, by proclamation, appointed for the first reading of the

service in Edinburgh: but in order to judge more surely of men’s

dispositions, the council delayed the matter till the twenty-third of

July; and they even gave notice, the Sunday before, of their intention to

commence the use of the new liturgy. As no considerable symptoms of

discontent appeared, they thought that they might safely proceed in their

purpose; and accordingly, in the cathedral church of St. Giles, the dean

of Edinburgh, arrayed in his surplice, began the service; the bishop

himself and many of the privy council being present. But no sooner had the

dean opened the book than a multitude of the meanest sort, most of them

women, clapping their hands, cursing, and crying out, “A pope, a pope!

Antichrist! stone him!” raised such a tumult that it was impossible to

proceed with the service. The bishop, mounting the pulpit in order to

appease the populace, had a stool thrown at him; the council was insulted:

and it was with difficulty that the magistrates were able, partly by

authority, partly by force, to expel the rabble, and to shut the doors

against them. The tumult, however, still continued without: stones were

thrown at the doors and windows: and when the service was ended, the

bishop, going home, was attacked, and narrowly escaped from the hands of

the enraged multitude. In the afternoon, the privy seal, because he

carried the bishop in his coach, was so pelted with stones, and hooted at

with execrations, and pressed upon by the eager populace, that if his

servants with drawn swords had not kept them off, the bishop’s life had

been exposed to the utmost danger.[*]

 

Though it was violently suspected that the low populace, who alone

appeared, had been instigated by some of higher condition, yet no proof of

it could be produced; and every one spake with disapprobation of the

licentiousness of the giddy multitude.[**] It was not thought safe,

however, to hazard a new insult by any new attempt to read the liturgy;

and the people seemed for the time to be appeased and satisfied. But it

being known that the king still persevered in his intentions of imposing

that mode of worship, men fortified themselves still further in their

prejudices against it; and great multitudes resorted to Edinburgh, in

order to oppose the introduction of so hated a novelty.[***]

 

It was not long before they broke, out in the most violent disorder. The

bishop of Galloway was attacked in the streets, and chased into the

chamber where the privy council was sitting. The council itself was

besieged and violently attacked: the town council met with the same fate:

and nothing could have saved the lives of all of them, but their

application to some popular lords, who protected them, and dispersed the

multitude. In this sedition, the actors were of some better condition than

in the former; though nobody of rank seemed as yet to countenance them.[*]

 

All men, however, began to unice and to encourage each other in opposition

to the religious innovations introduced into the kingdom. Petitions to the

council were signed and presented by persons of the highest quality: the

women took part, and, as was usual, with violence: the clergy every where

loudly declaimed against Popery and the liturgy, which they represented as

the same: the pulpits resounded with vehement invectives against

Antichrist: and the populace, who first opposed the service, was often

compared to Balaam’s ass, an animal in itself stupid and senseless, but

whose mouth had been opened by the Lord, to the admiration of the whole

world. In short, fanaticism mingling with faction, private interest with

the spirit of liberty, symptoms appeared on all hands of the most

dangerous insurrection and disorder.

 

The primate, a man of wisdom and prudence, who was all along averse to the

introduction of the liturgy, represented to the king the state of the

nation: the earl of Traquaire, the treasurer, set out for London, in order

to lay the matter more fully before him: every circumstance, whether the

condition of England or of Scotland were considered, should have engaged

him to desist from so hazardous an attempt: yet was Charles inflexible. In

his whole conduct of this affair, there appear no marks of the good sense

with which he was endowed: a lively instance of that species of character

so frequently to be met with; where there are found parts and judgment in

every discourse and opinion; in many actions, indiscretion and imprudence.

Men’s views of things are the result of their understanding alone: their

conduct is regulated by their understanding, their temper, and their

passions.

 

1638.

 

To so violent a combination of a whole kingdom, Charles had nothing to

oppose but a proclamation; in which he pardoned all past offences, and

exhorted the people to be more obedient for the future, and to submit

peaceably to the use of the liturgy. This proclamation was instantly

encountered with a public protestation, presented by the earl of Hume and

Lindesey: and this was the first time that men of quality had appeared in

any violent act of opposition.[*] But this proved a crisis. The

insurrection, which had been advancing by a gradual and slow progress, now

blazed up at once. No disorder, however, attended it. On the contrary, a

new order immediately took place. Four “tables,” as they were called, were

formed in Edinburgh. One consisted of nobility, another of gentry, a third

of ministers, a fourth of burgesses. The table of gentry was divided into

many subordinate tables, according to their different counties. In the

hands of the four tables the whole authority of the kingdom was placed.

Orders were issued by them, and every where obeyed with the utmost

regularity.[**] And among the first acts of their government was the

production of the “Covenant.”

 

This famous covenant consisted first of a renunciation of Popery, formerly

signed by James in his youth, and composed of many invectives, fitted to

inflame the minds of men against their fellow-creatures, whom Heaven has

enjoined them to cherish and to love. There followed a bond of union, by

which the subscribers obliged themselves to resist religious innovations,

and to defend each other against all opposition whatsoever: and all this,

for the greater glory of God, and the greater honor and advantage of their

king and country.[***] The people, without distinction of rank or

condition, of age or sex, flocked to the subscription of this covenant:

few in their judgment disapproved of it; and still fewer durst openly

condemn it. The king’s ministers and counsellors themselves were most of

them seized by the general contagion. And none but rebels to God, and

traitors to their country, it was thought, would withdraw themselves from

so salutary and so pious a combination.

 

The treacherous, the cruel, the unrelenting Philip, accompanied with all

the terrors of a Spanish inquisition, was scarcely, during the preceding

century, opposed in the Low Countries with more determined fury, than was

now, by the Scots, the mild, the humane Charles, attended with his

inoffensive liturgy.

 

The king began to apprehend the consequences. He sent the marquis of

Hamilton, as commissioner, with authority to treat with the Covenanters.

He required the covenant to be renounced and recalled: and he thought,

that on his part he had made very satisfactory concessions, when he

offered to suspend the canons and the liturgy, till in a fair and legal

way they could be received; and so to model the high commission, that it

should no longer give offence to his subjects.[*] Such general

declarations could not well give content to any, much less to those who

carried so much higher their pretensions. The Covenanters found themselves

seconded by the zeal of the whole nation. Above sixty thousand people were

assembled in a tumultuous manner in Edinburgh and the neighborhood.

Charles possessed no regular forces in either of his kingdoms. And the

discontents in England, though secret, were believed so violent, that the

king, it was thought, would find it very difficult to employ in such a

cause the power of that kingdom. The more, therefore, the popular leaders

in Scotland considered their situation, the less apprehension did they

entertain of royal power, and the more rigorously did they insist on

entire satisfaction. In answer to Hamilton’s demand of renouncing the

covenant, they plainly told him that they would sooner renounce their

baptism.[**] And the clergy invited the commissioner himself to subscribe

it, by informing him “with what peace and comfort it had filled the hearts

of all God’s people; what resolutions and beginnings of reformation of

manners were sensibly perceived in all parts of the nation, above any

measure they had ever before found or could have expected; how great glory

the Lord had received thereby; and what confidence they had that God would

make Scotland a blessed kingdom.”[***]

 

Hamilton returned to London; made another fruitless journey, with new

concessions, to Edinburgh; returned again to London; and was immediately

sent back with still more satisfactory concessions. The king was now

willing entirely to abolish the canons, the liturgy, and the high

commission court. He was even resolved to limit extremely the power of the

bishops, and was content if on any terms he could retain that order in the

church of Scotland.[****] And to insure all these gracious offers, he gave

Hamilton authority to summon first an assembly, then a parliament, where

every national grievance might be redressed and remedied.

 

These successive concessions of the king, which yet came still short of

the rising demands of the malecontents, discovered his own weakness,

encouraged their insolence, and gave no satisfaction. The offer, however,

of an assembly and a parliament, in which they expected to be entirely

masters, was willingly embraced by the Covenanters.

 

Charles, perceiving what advantage his enemies had reaped from their

covenant, resolved to have a covenant on his side; and he ordered one to

be drawn up for that purpose. It consisted of the same violent

renunciation of Popery above mentioned; which, though the king did not

approve of it, he thought it safest to adopt, in order to remove all the

suspicions entertained against him. As the Covenanters, in their bond of

mutual defence against all opposition, had been careful not to except the

king, Charles had formed a bond, which was annexed to this renunciation,

and which expressed the duty and loyalty of the subscribers to his

majesty.[*] But the Covenanters, perceiving that this new covenant was

only meant to weaken and divide them, received it with the utmost scorn

and detestation. And without delay they proceeded to model the future

assembly, from which such great achievments were expected.[**]

 

The genius of that religion which prevailed in Scotland, and which every

day was secretly gaining ground in England, was far front inculcating

deference and submission to the ecclesiastics, merely as such; or rather,

by nourishing in every individual the highest raptures and ecstasies of

devotion, it consecrated, in a manner, every individual, and in his own

eyes bestowed a character on him much superior to what forms and

ceremonious institutions could alone confer. The clergy of Scotland,

though such tumult was excited about religious worship and discipline,

were both poor and in small numbers; nor are they in general to be

considered, at least in the beginning, as the ringleaders of the sedition

which was raised on their account. On the contrary, the laity,

apprehending, from several instances which occurred, a spirit of

moderation in that order, resolved to domineer entirely in the assembly

which was summoned, and to hurry on the ecclesiastics by the same furious

zeal with which they were themselves transported.[***]

 

It had been usual, before the establishment of prelacy, for each

presbytery to send to the assembly, besides two or three ministers, one

lay commissioner;[*] and, as all the boroughs and universities sent

likewise commissioners, the lay members in that ecclesiastical court

nearly equalled the ecclesiastics. Not only this institution, which James,

apprehensive of zeal in the laity, had abolished, was now revived by the

Covenanters; they also introduced an innovation, which served still

further to reduce the clergy to subjection. By an edict of the tables,

whose authority was supreme, an elder from each parish was ordered to

attend the presbytery, and to give his vote in the choice both of the

commissioners and ministers who should be deputed to the assembly. As it

is not usual for the ministers, who are put in the list of candidates, to

claim a vote, all the elections by that means fell into the hands of the

laity: the most furious of all ranks were chosen: and the more to overawe

the clergy, a new device was fallen upon, of choosing to every

commissioner four or five lay assessors, who, though they could have no

vote, might yet interpose with their advice and authority in the

assembly.[**]

 

The assembly met at Glasgow; and, besides a great concourse of the people,

all the nobility and gentry of any family or interest were present, either

as members, assessors, or spectators; and it was apparent that the

resolutions taken by the Covenanters could here meet with no manner of

opposition. A firm determination had been entered into of utterly

abolishing episcopacy; and as a preparative to it, there was laid before

the presbytery of Edinburgh, and solemnly read in all the churches of the

kingdom, an accusation against the bishops, as guilty, all of them, of

heresy, simony, bribery, perjury, cheating, incest, adultery, fornication,

common swearing, drunkenness, gaming, breach of the Sabbath, and every

other crime that had occurred to the accusers.[***] The bishops sent a

protest, declining the authority of the assembly: the commissioner, too,

protested against the court, as illegally constituted and elected; and, in

his majesty’s name, dissolved it. This measure was foreseen, and little

regarded. The court still continued to sit, and to finish their

business.[****]

 

All the acts of assembly, since the accession of James to the crown of

England, were, upon pretty reasonable grounds, declared null and invalid.

The acts of parliament which affected ecclesiastical affairs were

supposed, on that very account, to have no manner of authority. And thus

episcopacy, the high commission, the articles of Perth, the canons, and

the liturgy, were abolished and declared unlawful; and the whole fabric

which Jamas and Charles, in a long course of years, had been rearing with

so much care and policy, fell at once to the ground.

 

1639.

 

The covenant, likewise, was ordered to be signed by every one, under pain

of excommunication.[*]

 

The independency of the ecclesiastical upon the civil power, was the old

Presbyterian principle, which had been zealously adopted at the

reformation, and which, though James and Charles had obliged the church

publicly to disclaim it, had secretly been adhered to by all ranks of

people. It was commonly asked whether Christ or the king were superior;

and as the answer seemed obvious, it was inferred, that the assembly,

being Christ’s council, was superior in all spiritual matters to the

parliament, which was only the king’s. But as the Covenanters were

sensible that this consequence, though it seemed to them irrefragable,

would not be assented to by the king, it became necessary to maintain

their religious tenets by military force, and not to trust entirely to

supernatural assistance, of which, however, they held themselves well

assured. They cast their eyes on all sides, abroad and at home, whence

ever they could expect any aid or support.

 

After France and Holland had entered into a league against Spain, and

framed a treaty of partition, by which they were to conquer and to divide

between them the Low Country provinces, England was invited to preserve a

neutrality between the contending parties, while the French and Dutch

should attack the maritime towns of Flanders. But the king replied to

D’Estrades, the French ambassador, who opened the proposal, that he had a

squadron ready, and would cross the seas, if necessary, with an army of

fifteen thousand men, in order to prevent these projected conquests.[**]

This answer, which proves that Charles though he expressed his mind with

an imprudent candor, had at last acquired a just idea of national interest

irritated Cardinal Richelieu; and, in revenge, that politic and

enterprising minister carefully fomented the first commotions in Scotland,

and secretly supplied the Covenanters with money and arms, in order to

encourage them in their opposition against their sovereign.

 

But the chief resource of the Scottish malecontents was in themselves, and

in their own vigor and abilities. No regular established commonwealth

could take juster measures, or execute them with greater promptitude, than

did this tumultuous combination, inflamed with bigotry for religious

trifles, and faction without a reasonable object. The whole kingdom was in

a manner engaged, and the men of greatest abilities soon acquired the

ascendant, which their family interest enabled them to maintain. The earl

of Argyle, though he long seemed to temporize, had at last embraced the

covenant; and he became the chief leader of that party; a man equally

supple and inflexible, cautious and determined, and entirely qualified to

make a figure during a factious and turbulent period. The earls of Rothes,

Cassils, Montrose, Lothian, the lords Lindesey, Louden, Yester, Balmerino,

distinguished themselves in that party. Many Scotch officers had acquired

reputation in the German wars, particularly under Gustavus; and these were

invited over to assist their country in her present necessity. The command

was intrusted to Lesley, a soldier of experience and abilities. Forces

were regularly enlisted and disciplined. Arms were commissioned and

imported from foreign countries. A few castles which belonged to the king,

being unprovided with victuals, ammunition, and garrisons, were soon

seized. And the whole country, except a small part, where the marquis of

Huntley still adhered to the king, being in the hands of the Covenanters,

was in a very little time put in a tolerable posture of defence.[*]

 

The fortifications of Leith were begun and carried on with great rapidity.

Besides the inferior sort, and those who labored for pay, incredible

numbers of volunteers, even noblemen and gentlemen, put their hand to the

work, and deemed the most abject employment to be dignified by the

sanctity of the cause. Women, too, of rank and condition, forgetting the

delicacy of their sex and the decorum of their character were intermingled

with the lowest rabble, and carried on their shoulders the rubbish

requisite for completing the fortifications.[**]

 

We must not omit another auxiliary of the Covenanters and no

inconsiderable one; a prophetess, who was much followed and admired by all

ranks of people. Her name Michelson, a woman full of whimseys partly

hysterical, partly religious; and inflamed with a zealous concern for the

ecclesiastical discipline of the Presbyterians. She spoke at certain times

only, and had often interruptions of days and weeks: but when she began to

renew her ecstasies, warning of the happy event was conveyed over the

whole country; thousands crowded about her house; and every word which she

uttered was received with veneration, as the most sacred oracles. The

covenant was her perpetual theme. The true, genuine covenant, she said,

was ratified in heaven: the king’s covenant was an invention of Satan:

when she spoke of Christ, she usually gave him the name of the Covenanting

Jesus. Rollo, a popular preacher, and zealous Covenanter, was her great

favorite, and paid her, on his part, no less veneration. Being desired by

the spectators to pray with her, and speak to her, he answered, “that he

durst not; and that it would be ill manners in him to speak while his

master, Christ, was speaking in her.”[*]

 

Charles had agreed to reduce episcopal authority so much, that it would no

longer have been of any service to support the crown; and this sacrifice

of his own interests he was willing to make, in order to attain public

peace and tranquillity. But he could not consent entirely to abolish an

order which he thought as essential to the being of a Christian church, as

his Scottish subjects deemed it incompatible with that sacred institution.

This narrowness of mind, if we would be impartial, we must either blame or

excuse equally on both sides; and thereby anticipate, by a little

reflection, that judgment which time, by introducing new subjects of

controversy, will undoubtedly render quite familiar to posterity.

 

So great was Charles’s aversion to violent and sanguinary measures, and so

strong his affection to his native kingdom that it is probable the contest

in his breast would be nearly equal between these laudable passions and

his attachment to the hierarchy. The latter affection, however, prevailed

for the time, and made him hasten those military preparations which he had

projected for subduing the refractory spirit of the Scottish nation. By

regular economy, he had not only paid all the debts contracted during the

Spanish and French wars, but had amassed a sum of two hundred thousand

pounds, which he reserved for any sudden exigency. The queen had great

interest with the Catholics, both from the sympathy of religion, and from

the favors and indulgences which she had been able to procure to them. She

now employed her credit, and persuaded them that it was reasonable to give

large contributions, as a mark of their duty to the king, during this

urgent necessity.[*] A considerable supply was obtained by this means; to

the great scandal of the Puritans, who were offended at seeing the king on

such good terms with the Papists, and repined that others should give what

they themselves were disposed to refuse him.

 

Charles’s fleet was formidable and well supplied. Having put five thousand

land forces on board, he intrusted it to the marquis of Hamilton, who had

orders to sail to the Frith of Forth, and to cause a diversion in the

forces of the malecontents. An army was levied of near twenty thousand

foot, and above three thousand horse; and was put under the command of the

earl of Arundel, a nobleman of great family, but celebrated neither for

military nor political abilities. The earl of Essex, a man of strict

honor, and extremely popular, especially among the soldiery, was appointed

lieutenant-general: the earl of Holland was general of the horse. The king

himself joined the army, and he summoned all the peers of England to

attend him. The whole had the appearance of a splendid court, rather than

of a military armament; and in this situation, carrying more show than

real force with it, the camp arrived at Berwick.[**]

 

The Scottish army was as numerous as that of the king, but inferior in

cavalry. The officers had more reputation and experience; and the

soldiers, though undisciplined and ill armed, were animated, as well by

the national aversion to England, and the dread of becoming a province to

their old enemy, as by an unsurmountable fervor of religion. The pulpits

had extremely assisted the officers in levying recruits, and had thundered

out anathemas against all those “who went not out to assist the Lord

against the mighty.”[***] Yet so prudent were the leaders of the

malecontents, that they immediately sent submissive messages to the king,

and craved to be admitted to a treaty.

 

Charles knew that the force of the Covenanters was considerable, their

spirits high, their zeal furious; and that, as they were not yet daunted

by any ill success, no reasonable terms could be expected from them. With

regard therefore to a treaty, great difficulties occurred on both sides.

Should he submit to the pretensions of the malecontents, (besides that the

prelacy must be sacrificed to their religious prejudices,) such a check

would be given to royal authority, which had very lately, and with much

difficulty, been thoroughly established in Scotland, that he must expect

ever after to retain in that kingdom no more than the appearance of

majesty. The great men, having proved by so sensible a trial the impotence

of law and prerogative, would return to their former licentiousness: the

preachers would retain their innate arrogance: and the people, unprotected

by justice, would recognize no other authority than that which they found

to domineer over them. England also, it was much to be feared, would

imitate so bad an example; and having already a strong propensity towards

republican and Puritanical factions, would expect, by the same seditious

practices, to attain the same indulgence. To advance so far, without

bringing the rebels to a total submission, at least to reasonable

concessions, was to promise them, in all future time, an impunity for

rebellion.

 

On the other hand, Charles considered that Scotland was never before,

under any of his ancestors, so united and so animated in its own defence;

yet had often been able to foil or elude the force of England, combined

heartily in one cause, and inured by long practice to the use of arms. How

much greater difficulty should he find, at present, to subdue by violence

a people inflamed with religious prejudices; while he could only oppose to

them a nation enervated by long peace, and lukewarm in his service; or,

what was more to be dreaded, many of them engaged in the same party with

the rebels?[*]

 

Should the war be only protracted beyond a campaign, (and who could expect

to finish it in that period?) his treasures would fail him; and for supply

he must have recourse to an English parliament, which, by fatal

experience, he had ever found more ready to encroach on the prerogatives,

than to supply the necessities of the crown. And what if he receive a

defeat from the rebel army? This misfortune was far from being impossible.

They were engaged in a national cause, and strongly actuated by mistaken

principles. His army was retained entirely by pay, and looked on the

quarrel with the same indifference which naturally belongs to mercenary

troops without possessing the discipline by which such troops are commonly

distinguished. And the consequences of a defeat, while Scotland was

enraged and England discontented, were so dreadful, that no motive should

persuade him to hazard it.

 

It is evident, that Charles had fallen into such a situation, that

whichever side he embraced, his errors must be dangerous. No wonder,

therefore, he was in great perplexity. But he did worse than embrace the

worst side; for, properly speaking, he embraced no side at all. He

concluded a sudden pacification, in which it was stipulated, that he

should withdraw his fleet and army; that within eight and forty hours the

Scots should dismiss their forces; that the king’s forts should be

restored to him; his authority be acknowledged; and a general assembly and

a parliament be immediately summoned, in order to compose all

differences.[*] What were the reasons which engaged the king to admit such

strange articles of peace, it is in vain to inquire; for there scarcely

could be any. The causes of that event may admit of a more easy

explication.

 

The malecontents had been very industrious in representing to the English

the grievances under which Scotland labored, and the ill counsels which

had been suggested to their sovereign. Their liberties, they said, were

invaded; the prerogatives of the crown extended beyond all former

precedent; illegal courts erected; the hierarchy exalted at the expense of

national privileges; and so many new superstitions introduced by the

haughty, tyrannical prelates, as begat a just suspicion that a project was

seriously formed for the restoration of Popery. The king’s conduct,

surely, in Scotland, had been in every thing, except in establishing the

ecclesiastical canons, more legal than in England; yet was there such a

general resemblance in the complaints of both kingdoms, that the English

readily assented to all the representations of the Scottish malecontents,

and believed that nation to have been driven by oppression into the

violent counsels which they had embraced. So far, therefore, from being

willing to second the king in subduing the free spirit of the Scots, they

rather pitied that unhappy people, who had been pushed to those

extremities; and they thought, that the example of such neighbors, as well

as their assistance, might some time be advantageous to England, and

encourage her to recover, by a vigorous effort, her violated laws and

liberties. The gentry and nobility, who, without attachment to the court,

without command in the army, attended in great numbers the English camp,

greedily seized, and propagated, and gave authority to these sentiments: a

retreat, very little honorable, which the earl of Holland, with a

considerable detachment of the English forces, had made before a

detachment of the Scottish, caused all these humors to blaze up at once:

and the king, whose character was not sufficiently vigorous or decisive,

and who was apt from facility to embrace hasty counsels, suddenly assented

to a measure which was recommended by all about him, and which favored his

natural propension towards the misguided subjects of his native

kingdom.[*]

 

Charles, having so far advanced in pacific measures, ought, with a steady

resolution, to have prosecuted them, and have submitted to every tolerable

condition demanded by the assembly and parliament; nor should he have

recommenced hostilities, but on account of such enormous and unexpected

pretensions as would have justified his cause, if possible, to the whole

English nation. So far, indeed, he adopted this plan, that he agreed, not

only to confirm his former concessions, of abrogating the canons, the

liturgy, the high commission, and the articles of Perth, but also to

abolish the order itself of bishops, for which he had so zealously

contended.[**] But this concession was gained by the utmost violence which

he could impose on his disposition and prejudices: he even secretly

retained an intention of seizing favorable opportunities, in order to:

recover the ground which he had lost.[***] And one step farther he could

not prevail with himself to advance. The assembly, when it met, paid no

deference to the king’s prepossessions, but gave full indulgence to their

own. They voted episcopacy to be unlawful in the church of Scotland: he

was willing to allow it contrary to the constitutions of that church. They

stigmatized the liturgy and canons as Popish: he agreed simply to abolish

them. They denominated the high commission, tyranny: he was content to set

it aside.[****]

 

The parliament, which sat after the assembly, advanced pretensions which

tended to diminish the civil power of the monarch; and, what probably

affected Charles still more, they were proceeding to ratify the acts of

assembly, when, by the king’s instructions,[*] Traquaire, the

commissioner, prorogued them. And on account of these claims, which might

have been foreseen, was the war renewed; with great advantages on the side

of the Covenanters and disadvantages on that of the king.

 

No sooner had Charles concluded the pacification without conditions than

the necessity of his affairs and his want of money obliged him to disband

his army; and as the soldiers had been held together solely by mercenary

views, it was not possible, without great trouble, and expense, and loss

of time, again to assemble them. The more prudent Covenanters had

concluded, that their pretensions being so contrary to the interests, and

still more to the inclinations, of the king, it was likely that they

should again be obliged to support their cause by arms; and they were

therefore careful, in dismissing their troops, to preserve nothing but the

appearance of a pacific disposition. The officers had orders to be ready

on the first summons: the soldiers were warned not to think the nation

secure from an English invasion: and the religious zeal which animated all

ranks of men, made them immediately fly to their standards as soon as the

trumpet was sounded by their spiritual and temporal leaders. The credit

which in their last expedition they had acquired, by obliging their

sovereign to depart from all his pretensions, gave courage to every one in

undertaking this new enterprise.[**]

 

1640.

 

The king, with great difficulty, found means to draw together an army; but

soon discovered that all savings being gone, and great debts contracted,

his revenue would be insufficient to support them. An English parliament,

therefore, formerly so unkind and intractable, must now, after above

eleven years’ intermission, after the king had tried many irregular

methods of taxation, after multiplied disgusts given to the Puritanical

party, be summoned to assemble, amidst the must pressing necessities of

the crown.

 

As the king resolved to try whether this house of commons would be more

compliant than their predecessors, and grant him supply on any reasonable

terms, the time appointed for the meeting of parliament was late, and very

near the time allotted for opening the campaign against the Scots. After

the past experience of their ill humor, and of their encroaching

disposition, he thought that he could not in prudence trust them with a

long session, till he had seen some better proofs of their good

intentions: the urgency of the occasion, and the little time allowed for

debate, were reasons which he reserved against the malecontents in the

house; and an incident had happened, which, he believed, had now furnished

him with still more cogent arguments.

 

The earl of Traquaire had intercepted a letter written to the king of

France by the Scottish malecontents, and had conveyed this letter to the

king. Charles, partly repenting of the large concessions made to the

Scots, partly disgusted at their fresh insolence and pretensions, seized

this opportunity of breaking with them. He had thrown into the Tower Lord

Loudon, commissioner from the Covenanters, one of the persons who had

signed the treasonable letter.[*] And he now laid the matter before the

parliament, whom he hoped to inflame by the resentment, and alarm by the

danger, of this application to a foreign power.

 

By the mouth of the lord keeper Finch, he discovered his wants, and

informed them, that he had been able to assemble his army, and to subsist

them, not by any revenue which he possessed, but by means of a large debt

of above three hundred thousand pounds, which he had contracted, and for

which he had given security upon the crown lands. He represented, that it

was necessary to grant supplies for the immediate and urgent demands of

his military armaments: that the season was far advanced, the time

precious, and none of it must be lost in deliberation; that though his

coffers were empty, they had not been exhausted by unnecessary pomp, or

sumptuous buildings, or any other kind of magnificence: that whatever

supplies had been levied on his subjects, had been employed for their

advantage and preservation; and, like vapors rising out of the earth, and

gathered into a cloud, had fallen in sweet and refreshing showers on the

same fields from which they had at first been exhaled: that though he

desired such immediate assistance as might prevent for the time a total

disorder in the government he was far from any intention of precluding

them from their right to inquire into the state of the kingdom, and to

offer his petitions for the redress of their grievances: that as much as

was possible of this season should afterwards be allowed them for that

purpose: that as he expected only such supply at present as the current

service necessarily required, it would be requisite to assemble them again

next winter, when they should have full leisure to conclude whatever

business had this session been left imperfect and unfinished: that the

parliament of Ireland had twice put such trust in his good intentions as

to grant him, in the beginning of the session, a large supply, and had

ever experienced good effects from the confidence reposed in him: and

that; in every circumstance, his people should find his conduct suitable

to a just, pious, and gracious king; and such as was calculated to promote

an entire harmony between prince and parliament.[*]

 

However plausible these topics, they made small impression on the house of

commons. By some illegal, and several suspicious measures of the crown,

and by the courageous opposition which particular persons, amidst dangers

and hardships, had made to them, the minds of men, throughout the nation,

had taken such a turn, as to ascribe every honor to the refractory

opposers of the king and the ministers. These were the only patriots, the

only lovers of their country, the only heroes, and perhaps, too, the only

true Christians. A reasonable compliance with the court was slavish

dependence; a regard to the king, servile flattery; a confidence in his

promises, shameful prostitution. This general cast of thought, which has

more or less prevailed in England during near a century and a half, and

which has been the cause of much good and much ill in public affairs,

never predominated more than during the reign of Charles. The present

house of commons, being entirely composed of country gentlemen, who came

into parliament with all their native prejudices about them, and whom the

crown had no means of influencing, could not fail to contain a majority of

these stubborn patriots.

 

Affairs likewise, by means of the Scottish insurrection and the general

discontents in England, were drawing so near to a crisis, that the leaders

of the house, sagacious and penetrating, began to foresee the

consequences, and to hope that the time so long wished for was now come,

when royal authority must fall into a total subordination under popular

assemblies, and when public liberty must acquire a full ascendant. By

reducing the crown to necessities, they had hitherto found that the king

had been pushed into violent counsels, which had served extremely the

purposes of his adversaries: and by multiplying these necessities, it was

foreseen that his prerogative, undermined on all sides, must at last be

overthrown, and be no longer dangerous to the privileges of the people.

Whatever, therefore, tended to compose the differences between king and

parliament, and to preserve the government uniformly in its present

channel, was zealously opposed by these popular leaders; and their past

conduct and sufferings gave them credit sufficient to effect all their

purposes.

 

The house of commons, moved by these and many other obvious reasons,

instead of taking notice of the king’s complaints against his Scottish

subjects, or his applications for supply, entered immediately upon

grievances; and a speech which Pym made them on that subject was much more

hearkened to, than that which the lord keeper had delivered to them in the

name of their sovereign. The subject of Pym’s harangue has been

sufficiently explained above; where we gave an account of all the

grievances, imaginary in the church, more real in the state, of which the

nation at that time so loudly complained.[*] The house began with

examining the behavior of the speaker the last day of the former

parliament; when he refused, on account of the king’s command, to put the

question: and they declared it a breach of privilege. They proceeded next

to inquire into the imprisonment and prosecution of Sir John Elliot,

Hollis, and Valentine:[**] the affair of ship money was canvassed: and

plentiful subject of inquiry was suggested on all hands. Grievances were

regularly classed under three heads; those with regard to privileges of

parliament, to the property of the subject, and to religion.[***]

 

The king, seeing a large and inexhaustible field opened, pressed them

again for supply; and finding his message ineffectual, he came to the

house of peers, and desired their good offices with the commons. The peers

were sensible of the king’s urgent necessities; and thought that supply on

this occasion ought, both in reason and in decency, to go before

grievances. They ventured to represent their sense of the matter to the

commons; but their intercession did harm. The commons had always claimed,

as their peculiar province the granting of supplies; and, though the peers

had here gone no further than offering advice, the lower house immediately

thought proper to vote so unprecedented an interposition to be a breach of

privilege.[*] Charles, in order to bring the matter of supply to some

issue, solicited the house by new messages: and finding that ship money

gave great alarm and disgust; besides informing them, that he never

intended to make a constant revenue of it, that all the money levied had

been regularly, with other great sums, expended on equipping the navy; he

now went so far as to offer them a total abolition of that obnoxious

claim, by any law which the commons should think proper to present to him.

In return, he only asked for his necessities a supply of twelve subsidies,—about

six hundred thousand pounds,—and that payable in three years; but at

the same time he let them know, that, considering the situation of his

affairs, a delay would be equivalent to a denial.[**] The king though the

majority was against him, never had more friends in any house of commons;

and the debate was carried on for two days, with great zeal and warmth on

both sides.

 

It was urged by the partisans of the court, that the happiest occasion

which the fondest wishes could suggest, was now presented for removing all

disgusts and jealousies between king and people, and for reconciling their

sovereign forever to the use of parliaments: that if they, on their part,

laid aside all enormous claims and pretensions, and provided in a

reasonable manner for the public necessities, they needed entertain no

suspicion of any insatiable ambition or illegal usurpation in the crown:

that though due regard had not always been paid, during this reign, to the

rights of the people, yet no invasion of them had been altogether

deliberate and voluntary; much less the result of wanton tyranny and

injustice; and still less of a formal design to subvert the constitution.

That to repose a reasonable confidence in the king, and generously to

supply his present wants, which proceeded neither from prodigality nor

misconduct, would be the true means of gaining on his generous nature, and

extorting, by a gentle violence, such concessions as were requisite for

the establishment of public liberty: that he had promised, not only on the

word of a prince, but also on that of a gentleman, (the expression which

he had been pleased to use,) that, after the supply was granted the

parliament should still have liberty to continue their deliberations:

could it be suspected that any man, any prince much less such a one, whose

word was as yet sacred and inviolate, would, for so small a motive forfeit

his honor, and, with it, all future trust and confidence, by breaking a

promise so public and so solemn? that even if the parliament should be

deceived in reposing this confidence in him, they neither lost any thing,

nor incurred any danger; since it was evidently necessary, for the

security of public peace, to supply him with money, in order to suppress

the Scottish rebellion: that he had so far suited his first demands to

their prejudices, that he only asked a supply for a few months, and was

willing, after so short a trust from them, to fall again into dependence,

and to trust them for his further support and subsistence: that if he now

seemed to desire something further, he also made them, in return, a

considerable offer, and was willing, for the future, to depend on them for

a revenue which was quite necessary for public honor and security: that

the nature of the English constitution supposed a mutual confidence

between king and parliament: and if they should refuse it on their part,

especially with circumstances of such outrage and indignity, what could be

expected but a total dissolution of government, and violent factions,

followed by the most dangerous convulsions and intestine disorders?

 

In opposition to these arguments, it was urged by the malecontent party,

that the court had discovered, on their part, but few symptoms of that

mutual confidence to which they now so kindly invited the commons: that

eleven years’ intermission of parliaments—the longest that was to be

found in the English annals—was a sufficient indication of the

jealousy entertained against the people; or rather of designs formed for

the suppression of all their liberties and privileges: that the ministers

might well plead necessity, nor could any thing, indeed, be a stronger

proof of some invincible necessity, than their embracing a measure for

which they had conceived so violent an aversion, as the assembling of an

English parliament: that this necessity, however, was purely ministerial,

not national; and if the same grievances, ecclesiastical and civil, under

which this nation itself labored, had pushed the Scots to extremities, was

it requisite that the English should forge their own chains, by imposing

chains on their unhappy neighbors? that the ancient practice of parliament

was to give grievances the precedency of supply; and this order, so

carefully observed by their ancestors, was founded on a jealousy inherent

in the constitution, and was never interpreted as any peculiar diffidence

of the present sovereign: that a practice which had been upheld during

times the most favorable to liberty, could not, in common prudence, be

departed from, where such undeniable reasons for suspicion had been

afforded: that it was ridiculous to plead the advanced season, and the

urgent occasion for supply; when it plainly appeared that, in order to

afford a pretence for this topic, and to seduce the commons, great

political contrivance had been employed: that the writs for elections were

issued early in the winter; and if the meeting of parliament had not

purposely been delayed till so near the commencement of military

operations, there had been leisure sufficient to have redressed all

national grievances, and to have proceeded afterwards to an examination of

the king’s occasion for supply: that the intention of so gross an artifice

was to engage the commons, under pretence of necessity, to violate the

regular order of parliament; and a precedent of that kind being once

established, no inquiry into public measures would afterwards be

permitted: that scarcely any argument more unfavorable could be pleaded

for supply, than an offer to abolish ship money; a taxation the most

illegal and the most dangerous that had ever, in any reign, been imposed

upon the nation: and that, by bargaining for the remission of that duty,

the commons would in a manner ratify the authority by which it had been

levied; at least give encouragement for advancing new pretensions of a

like nature, in hopes of resigning them on like advantageous conditions.

 

These reasons, joined to so many occasions of ill humor, seemed to sway

with the greater number: but, to make the matter worse, Sir Harry Vane,

the secretary, told the commons, without any authority from the king, that

nothing less than twelve subsidies would be accepted as a compensation for

the abolition of ship money. This assertion, proceeding from the

indiscretion, if we are not rather to call it the treachery of Vane,

displeased the house, by showing a stiffness and rigidity in the king,

which, in a claim so ill grounded, was deemed inexcusable.[*] We are

informed likewise, that some men, who were thought to understand the state

of the nation, affirmed in the house, that the amount of twelve subsidies

was a greater sum than could be found in all England: such were the happy

ignorance and inexperience of those times with regard to taxes.[**]

 

The king was in great doubt and perplexity. He saw that his friends in the

house were outnumbered by his enemies, and that the same counsels were

still prevalent which had ever bred such opposition and disturbance.

Instead of hoping that any supply would be granted him to carry on war

against the Scots, whom the majority of the house regarded as their best

friends and firmest allies; he expected every day that they would present

him an address for making peace with those rebels. And if the house met

again, a vote, he was informed, would certainly pass, to blast his revenue

of ship money; and thereby renew all the opposition which, with so much

difficulty, he had surmounted in levying that taxation. Where great evils

lie on all sides, it is difficult to follow the best counsel; nor is it

any wonder that the king, whose capacity was not equal to situations of

such extreme delicacy, should hastily have formed and executed the

resolution of dissolving this parliament: a measure, however, of which he

soon after repented, and which the subsequent events, more than any

convincing reason, inclined every one to condemn. The last parliament,

which ended with such rigor and violence, had yet at first covered their

intentions with greater appearance of moderation than this parliament had

hitherto assumed.

 

An abrupt and violent dissolution naturally excites discontents among the

people, who usually put entire confidence in their representatives, and

expect from them the redress of all grievances. As if there were not

already sufficient grounds of complaint, the king persevered still in

those counsels which, from experience, he might have been sensible were so

dangerous and unpopular. Bellasis and Sir John Hotham were summoned before

the council; and, refusing to give any account of their conduct in

parliament, were committed to prison. All the petitions and complaints

which had been sent to the committee of religion, were demanded from Crew,

chairman of that committee; and on his refusal to deliver them, he was

sent to the Tower. The studies, and even the pockets of the earl of

Warwick and Lord Broke, before the expiration of privilege, were searched,

in expectation of finding treasonable papers. These acts of authority were

interpreted, with some appearance of reason, to be invasions on the right

of national assemblies.[*] But the king, after the first provocation which

he met with, never sufficiently respected the privileges of parliament;

and, by his example, he further confirmed their resolution, when they

should acquire power, to pay like disregard to the prerogatives of the

crown.

 

Though the parliament was dissolved, the convocation was still allowed to

sit; a practice of which, since the reformation, there were but few

instances,[*] and which was for that reason supposed by many to be

irregular. Besides granting to the king a supply from the spirituality,

and framing many canons, the convocation, jealous of like innovations with

those which had taken place in Scotland, imposed an oath on the clergy and

the graduates in the universities, by which every one swore to maintain

the established government of the church by archbishops, bishops, deans,

chapters, etc.[**] These steps, in the present discontented humor of the

nation, were commonly deemed illegal; because not ratified by consent of

parliament, in whom all authority was now supposed to be centred. And

nothing, besides, could afford more subject of ridicule, than an oath

which contained an “et cÃ¦tera,” in the midst of it.

 

The people, who generally abhorred the convocation as much as they revered

the parliament, could scarcely be restrained from insulting and abusing

this assembly; and the king was obliged to give them guards, in order to

protect them.[***] An attack too was made during the night upon Laud, in

his palace of Lambeth, by above five hundred persons; and he found it

necessary to fortify himself for his defence.[****] A multitude,

consisting of two thousand secretaries, entered St. Paul’s, where the high

commission then sat, tore down the benches, and cried out, “No bishop; no

high commission.”[v] All these instances of discontent were presages of

some great revolution, had the court possessed sufficient skill to discern

the danger, or sufficient power to provide against it.

 

In this disposition of men’s minds, it was in vain that the king issued a

declaration, in order to convince his people of the necessity which he lay

under of dissolving the last parliament.[v*]

 

The chief topic on which he insisted was, that the commons imitated the

bad example of all then predecessors of late years, in making continual

encroachments on his authority, in censuring his whole administration and

conduct, in discussing every circumstance of public government, and in

their indirect bargaining and contracting with their king for supply; as

if nothing ought to be given him but what he should purchase, either by

quitting somewhat of his royal prerogative, or by diminishing and

lessening his standing revenue. These practices, he said, were contrary to

the maxims of their ancestors; and these practices were totally

incompatible with monarchy.[*] 5
 

The king, disappointed of parliamentary subsidies, was obliged to have

recourse to other expedients, in order to supply his urgent necessities.

The ecclesiastical subsidies served him in some stead; and it seemed but

just that the clergy should contribute to a war which was in a great

measure of their own raising.[**] He borrowed money from his ministers and

courtiers; and so much was he beloved among them, that above three hundred

thousand pounds were subscribed in a few days; though nothing surely could

be more disagreeable to a prince full of dignity, than to be a burden on

his friends instead of being a support to them. Some attempts were made

towards forcing a loan from the citizens; but still repelled by the spirit

of liberty, which was now become unconquerable.[***] A loan of forty

thousand pounds was extorted from the Spanish merchants, who had bullion

in the Tower exposed to the attempts of the king. Coat and conduct money

for the soldiery was levied on the counties; an ancient practice,[****]

but supposed to be abolished by the petition of right. All the pepper was

bought from the East India Company upon trust, and sold at a great

discount for ready money.[v] A scheme was proposed for coining two or

three hundred thousand pounds of base money:[v*] such were the extremities

to which Charles was reduced. The fresh difficulties which, amidst the

present distresses, were every day raised with regard to the payment of

ship money, obliged him to exert continual acts of authority, augmented

the discontents of the people, and increased his indigence and

necessities.[v**]

 

The present expedients, however, enabled the king, though with great

difficulty, to march his army, consisting of nineteen thousand foot and

two thousand horse.[*] The earl of Northumberland was appointed general;

the earl of Strafford, who was called over from Ireland,

lieutenant-general; Lord Conway, general of the horse. A small fleet was

thought sufficient to serve the purposes of this expedition.

 

So great are the effects of zeal and unanimity, that the Scottish army,

though somewhat superior, were sooner ready than the king’s; and they

marched to the borders of England. To engage them to proceed, besides

their general knowledge of the secret discontents of that kingdom, Lord

Saville had forged a letter, in the name of six noblemen the most

considerable of England, by which the Scots were invited to assist their

neighbors in procuring a redress of grievances.[**] Notwithstanding these

warlike preparations and hostile attempts, the Covenanters still preserved

the most pathetic and most submissive language; and entered England, they

said, with no other view than to obtain access to the king’s presence, and

lay their humble petition at his royal feet. At Newburn upon Tyne, they

were opposed by a detachment of four thousand five hundred men under

Conway, who seemed resolute to dispute with them the passage of the river.

The Scots first entreated them, with great civility, not to stop them in

their march to their gracious sovereign; and then attacked them with great

bravery, killed several, and chased the rest from their ground. Such a

panic seized the whole English army, that the forces at Newcastle fled

immediately to Durham; and not yet thinking themselves safe, they deserted

that town, end retreated into Yorkshire.[***]

 

The Scots took possession of Newcastle; and though sufficiently elated

with their victory, they preserved exact discipline, and persevered in

their resolution of paying for every thing, in order still to maintain the

appearance of an amicable correspondence with England. They also

despatched messengers to the king, who was arrived at York; and they took

care, after the advantage which they had obtained, to redouble their

expressions of loyalty, duty, and submission to his person; and they even

made apologies, full of sorrow and contrition for their late

victory.[****]

 

Charles was in a very distressed condition. The nation was universally and

highly discontented. The army was discouraged, and began likewise to be

discontented, both from the contagion of general disgust, and as an excuse

for their misbehavior, which they were desirous of representing rather as

want of will than of courage to fight. The treasury too was quite

exhausted, and every expedient for supply had been tried to the uttermost.

No event had happened, but what might have been foreseen as necessary, at

least as very probable; yet such was the king’s situation, that no

provision could be made, nor was even any resolution taken against such an

exigency.

 

In order to prevent the advance of the Scots upon him, the king agreed to

a treaty, and named sixteen English noblemen, who met with eleven Scottish

commissioners at Rippon. The earls of Hertford, Bedford, Salisbury,

Warwick, Essex, Holland, Bristol, and Berkshire, the lords Kimbolton,

Wharton. Dunsmore, Paget, Broke Saville, Paulet, and Howard of Escric,

were chosen by the king; all of them popular men and consequently supposed

nowise averse to the Scottish invasion, or unacceptable to that nation.[*]

 

An address arrived from the city of London, petitioning for a parliament;

the great point to which all men’s projects at this time tended.[**]

Twelve noblemen presented a petition to the same purpose.[***] But the

king contented himself with summoning a great council of the peers at

York; a measure which had formerly been taken in cases of sudden

emergency, but which at present could serve to little purpose. Perhaps the

king, who dreaded above all things the house of commons, and who expected

no supply from them on any reasonable terms, thought that, in his present

distresses, he might be enabled to levy supplies by the authority of the

peers alone. But the employing so long the plea of a necessity which

appeared distant and doubtful, rendered it impossible for him to avail

himself of a necessity which was now at last become real, urgent, and

inevitable.

 

By Northumberland’s sickness, the command of the army had devolved on

Strafford. This nobleman possessed more vigor of mind than the king or any

of the council. He advised Charles rather to put all to hazard, than

submit to unworthy terms as were likely to be imposed upon him.

 

The loss sustained at Newburn, he said, was inconsiderable and though a

panic had for the time seized the army, that event was nothing strange

among new levied troops and the Scots, being in the same condition, would

no doubt be liable in their turn to a like accident. His opinion therefore

was, that the king should push forward and attack the Scots, and bring the

affair to a quick decision; and, if he were ever so unsuccessful, nothing

worse could befall him than what from his inactivity he would certainly be

exposed to.[*] To show how easy it would be to execute this project, he

ordered an assault to be made on some quarters of the Scots, and he gained

an advantage over them. No cessation of arms had as yet been agreed to

during the treaty at Rippon; yet great clamor prevailed on account of this

act of hostility. And when it was known that the officer who conducted the

attack was a Papist, a violent outcry was raised against the king for

employing that hated sect in the murder of his Protestant subjects.[**]

 

It may be worthy of remark, that several mutinies had arisen among the

English troops when marching to join the army; and some officers had been

murdered merely on suspicion of their being Papists.[***] The petition of

right had abolished all martial law; and by an inconvenience which

naturally attended the plan, as yet new and unformed, of regular and rigid

liberty, it was found absolutely impossible for the generals to govern the

army by all the authority which the king could legally confer upon them.

The lawyers had declared, that martial law could not be exercised, except

in the very presence of an enemy; and because it had been found necessary

to execute a mutineer, the generals thought it advisable, for their own

safety, to apply for a pardon from the crown. This weakness, however, was

carefully concealed from the army, and Lord Conway said, that if any

lawyer were so imprudent as to discover the secret to the soldiers, it

would be necessary instantly to refute it, and to hang the lawyer himself

by sentence of a court martial.[****]

 

An army new levied, undisciplined, frightened, seditious, ill paid, and

governed by no proper authority, was very unfit for withstanding a

victorious and high-spirited enemy, and retaining in subjection a

discontented and zealous nation.

 

Charles, in despair of being able to stem the torrent, at last determined

to yield to it: and as he foresaw that the great council of the peers

would advise him to call a parliament, he told them, in his first speech,

that he had already taken this resolution. He informed them likewise, that

the queen, in a letter which she had written to him, had very earnestly

recommended that measure. This good prince, who was extremely attached to

his consort, and who passionately wished to render her popular in the

nation, forgot not, amidst all his distress, the interests of his domestic

tenderness.[*]

 

In order to subsist both armies, (for the king was obliged, in order to

save the northern counties, to pay his enemies,) Charles wrote to the

city, desiring a loan of two hundred thousand pounds. And the peers at

York, whose authority was now much greater than that of their sovereign,

joined in the same request:[**] so low was this prince already fallen in

the eyes of his own subjects.

 

As many difficulties occurred in the negotiation with the Scots, it was

proposed to transfer the treaty from Rippon to London; a proposal

willingly embraced by that nation, who were now sure of treating with

advantage in a place where the king, they foresaw, would be in a manner a

prisoner, in the midst of his implacable enemies, and their determined

friends.[***]
