THE many jealousies to which Henry IV.‘s situation naturally exposed him,

      had so infected his temper, that he had entertained unreasonable

      suspicions with regard to the fidelity of his eldest son; and during the

      latter years of his life, he had excluded that prince from all share in

      public business, and was even displeased to see him at the head of armies,

      where his martial talents, though useful to the support of government,

      acquired him a renown, which he thought might prove dangerous to his own

      authority. The active spirit of young Henry, restrained from its proper

      exercise, broke out into extravagances of every kind; and the riot of

      pleasure, the frolic of debauchery, the outrage of wine, filled the

      vacancies of a mind better adapted to the pursuits of ambition and the

      cares of government. This course of life threw him among companions, whose

      disorders, if accompanied with spirit and humor, he indulged and seconded;

      and he was detected in many sallies, which, to severer eyes, appeared

      totally unworthy of his rank and station. There even remains a tradition

      that, when heated with liquor and jollity, he scrupled not to accompany

      his riotous associates in attacking the passengers on the streets and

      highways, and despoiling them of their goods; and he found an amusement in

      the incidents which the terror and regret of these defenceless people

      produced on such occasions. This extreme of dissoluteness proved equally

      disagreeable to his father, as that eager application to business which

      had at first given him occasion of jealousy; and he saw in his son’s

      behavior the same neglect of decency, the same attachment to low company,

      which had degraded the personal character of Richard, and which, more than

      all his errors in government, had tended to overturn his throne. But the

      nation in general considered the young prince with more indulgence; and

      observed so many gleams of generosity, spirit, and magnanimity, breaking

      continually through the cloud which a wild conduct threw over his

      character, that they never ceased hoping for his amendment; and they

      ascribed all the weeds, which shot up in that rich soil, to the want of

      proper culture and attention in the king and his ministers. There happened

      an incident which encouraged these agreeable views, and gave much occasion

      for favorable reflections to all men of sense and candor. A riotous

      companion of the prince’s had been indicted before Gascoigne, the chief

      justice, for some disorders; and Henry was not ashamed to appear at the

      bar with the criminal, in order to give him countenance and protection.

      Finding that his presence had not overawed the chief justice, he proceeded

      to insult that magistrate on his tribunal; but Gascoigne, mindful of the

      character which he then bore, and the majesty of the sovereign and of the

      laws which he sustained, ordered the prince to be carried to prison for

      his rude behavior.[*] The spectators were agreeably disappointed, when

      they saw the heir of the crown submit peaceably to this sentence, make

      reparation for his error by acknowledging it, and check his impetuous

      nature in the midst of its extravagant career.

     

      The memory of this incident, and of many others of a like nature, rendered

      the prospect of the future reign nowise disagreeable to the nation, and

      increased the joy which the death of so unpopular a prince as the late

      king naturally occasioned. The first steps taken by the young prince

      confirmed all those prepossessions entertained in his favor.[**] He called

      together his former companions, acquainted them with his intended

      reformation, exhorted them to imitate his example, but strictly inhibited

      them, till they had given proofs of their sincerity in this particular,

      from appearing any more in his presence; and he thus dismissed them with

      liberal presents.[***]

     

      The wise ministers of his father, who had checked his riots, found that

      they had unknowingly been paying the highest court to him; and were

      received with all the marks of favor and confidence. The chief justice

      himself, who trembled to approach the royal presence, met with praises

      instead of reproaches for his past conduct, and was exhorted to persevere

      in the same rigorous and impartial execution of the laws. The surprise of

      those who expected an opposite behavior, augmented their satisfaction; and

      the character of the young king appeared brighter than if it had never

      been shaded by any errors.

     

      But Henry was anxious not only to repair his own misconduct, but also to

      make amends for those iniquities into which policy or the necessity of

      affairs had betrayed his father. He expressed the deepest sorrow for the

      fate of the unhappy Richard, did justice to the memory of that unfortunate

      prince, even performed his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity, and

      cherished all those who had distinguished themselves by their loyalty and

      attachment towards him.[*] Instead of continuing the restraints which the

      jealousy of his father had imposed on the earl of Marche, he received that

      young nobleman with singular courtesy and favor; and by this magnanimity

      so gained on the gentle and unambitious nature of his competitor, that he

      remained ever after sincerely attached to him, and gave him no disturbance

      in his future government. The family of Piercy was restored to its fortune

      and honors.[**] The king seemed ambitious to bury all party distinctions

      in oblivion: the instruments of the preceding reign, who had been advanced

      from their blind zeal for the Lancastrian interests, more than from their

      merits, gave place every where to men of more honorable characters; virtue

      seemed now to have an open career, in which it might exert itself: the

      exhortations, as well as example of the prince, gave it encouragement: all

      men were unanimous in their attachment to Henry; and the defects of his

      title were forgotten, amidst the personal regard which was universally

      paid to him.

     

      There remained among the people only one party distinction, which was

      derived from religious differences, and which, as it is of a peculiar and

      commonly a very obstinate nature, the popularity of Henry was not able to

      overcome. The Lollards were every day increasing in the kingdom, and were

      become a formed party, which appeared extremely dangerous to the church,

      and even formidable to the civil authority.[***] The enthusiasm by which

      these sectaries were generally actuated the great alterations which they

      pretended to introduce, the hatred which they expressed against the

      established hierarchy, gave an alarm to Henry; who, either from a sincere

      attachment to the ancient religion, or from a dread of the unknown

      consequences which attend all important changes, was determined to execute

      the laws against such bold innovators.

     

      The head of this sect was Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, a nobleman who

      had distinguished himself by his valor and his military talents, and had,

      on many occasions, acquired the esteem both of the late and of the present

      king.[*] His high character and his zeal for the new sect pointed him out

      to Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, as the proper victim of

      ecclesiastical severity, whose punishment would strike a terror into the

      whole party, and teach them that they must expect no mercy under the

      present administration. He applied to Henry for a permission to indict

      Lord Cobham;[**] but the generous nature of the prince was averse to such

      sanguinary methods of conversion. He represented to the primate, that

      reason and conviction were the best expedients for supporting truth; that

      all gentle means ought first to be tried, in order to reclaim men from

      error; and that he himself would endeavor, by a conversation with Cobham,

      to reconcile him to the Catholic faith. But he found that nobleman

      obstinate in his opinions, and determined not to sacrifice truths of such

      infinite moment to his complaisance for sovereigns.[***]

     

      Henry’s principles of toleration, or rather his love of the practice,

      could carry him no farther; and he then gave full reins to ecclesiastical

      severity against the inflexible heresiarch. The primate indicted Cobham,

      and with the assistance of his three suffragans, the bishops of London,

      Winchester, and St. David’s, condemned him to the flames for his erroneous

      opinions. Cobham, who was confined in the Tower, made his escape before

      the day appointed for his execution. The bold spirit of the man, provoked

      by persecution and stimulated by zeal, was urged to attempt the most

      criminal enterprises; and his unlimited authority over the new sect proved

      that he well merited the attention of the civil magistrate. He formed in

      his retreat very violent designs against his enemies; and despatching his

      emissaries to all quarters, appointed a general rendezvous of the party,

      in order to seize the person of the king at Eltham, and put their

      persecutors to the sword.[*]

     

      1414.

     

      Henry, apprised of their intention, removed to Westminster: Cobham was not

      discouraged by this disappointment; but changed the place of rendezvous to

      the field near St. Giles; the king, having shut the gates of the city, to

      prevent any reÃ«nforcement to the Lollards from that quarter, came into the

      field in the night-time, seized such of the conspirators as appeared, and

      afterwards laid hold of the several parties who were hastening to the

      place appointed. It appeared, that a few only were in the secret of the

      conspiracy; the rest implicitly followed their leaders: but upon the trial

      of the prisoners, the treasonable designs of the sect were rendered

      certain, both from evidence and from the confession of the criminals

      themselves.[**] Some were executed; the greater number pardoned.[***]

      Cobham himself, who made his escape by flight, was not brought to justice

      till four years after; when he was hanged as a traitor; and his body was

      burnt on the gibbet, in execution of the sentence pronounced against him

      as a heretic.[****] This criminal design, which was perhaps somewhat

      aggravated by the clergy, brought discredit upon the party, and checked

      the progress of that sect, which had embraced the speculative doctrines of

      Wickliffe, and at the same time aspired to a reformation of ecclesiastical

      abuses.

     

      These two points were the great objects of the Lollards; but the bulk of

      the nation was not affected in the same degree by both of them. Common

      sense and obvious reflection had discovered to the people the advantages

      of a reformation in discipline; but the age was not yet so far advanced as

      to be seized with the spirit of controversy, or to enter into those

      abstruse doctrines which the Lollards endeavored to propagate throughout

      the kingdom. The very notion of heresy alarmed the generality of the

      people: innovation in fundamental principles was suspicious: curiosity was

      not, as yet, a sufficient counterpoise to authority; and even many, who

      were the greatest friends to the reformation of abuses, were anxious to

      express their detestation of the speculative tenants of the Wickliffites,

      which, they feared, threw disgrace on so good a cause. This turn of

      thought appears evidently in the proceedings of the parliament which was

      summoned immediately after the detection of Cobham’s conspiracy. That

      assembly passed severe laws against the new heretics: they enacted, that

      whoever was convicted of Lollardy before the ordinary besides suffering

      capital punishment according to the laws formerly established, should also

      forfeit his lands and goods to the king; and that the chancellor,

      treasurer, justices of the two benches, sheriffs, justices of the peace,

      and all the chief magistrates in every city and borough, should take an

      oath to use their utmost endeavors for the extirpation of heresy.[*] Yet

      this very parliament, when the king demanded supply, renewed the offer

      formerly pressed upon his father, and entreated him to seize all the

      ecclesiastical revenues, and convert them to the use of the crown.[**] The

      clergy were alarmed: they could offer the king no bribe which was

      equivalent: they only agreed to confer on him all the priories alien,

      which depended on capital abbeys in Normandy, and had been bequeathed to

      these abbeys, when that province remained united to England: and

      Chicheley, now archbishop of Canterbury, endeavored to divert the blow by

      giving occupation to the king, and by persuading him to undertake a war

      against France, in order to recover his lost rights to that kingdom.[***]

     

      It was the dying injunction of the late king to his son, not to allow the

      English to remain long in peace, which was apt to breed intestine

      commotions; but to employ them in foreign expeditions, by which the prince

      might acquire honor; the nobility, in sharing his dangers, might attach

      themselves to his person; and all the restless spirits find occupation for

      their inquietude. The natural disposition of Henry sufficiently inclined

      him to follow this advice, and the civil disorders of France, which had

      been prolonged beyond those of England, opened a full career to his

      ambition.

     

      1415.

     

      The death of Charles V., which followed soon after that of Edward III.,

      and the youth of his son, Charles VI., put the two kingdoms for some time

      in a similar situation; and it was not to be apprehended, that either of

      them, during a minority, would be able to make much advantage of the

      weakness of the other. The jealousies also between Charles’s three uncles,

      the dukes of Anjou, Bern, and Burgundy, had distracted the affairs of

      France rather more than those between the dukes of Lancaster, York, and

      Gloucester. Richard’s three uncles, disordered those of England; and had

      carried off the attention of the French nation from any vigorous

      enterprise against foreign states. But in proportion as Charles advanced

      in years, the factions were composed; his two uncles, the dukes of Anjou

      and Burgundy, died; and the king himself, assuming the reins of

      government, discovered symptoms of genius and spirit, which revived the

      drooping hopes of his country. This promising state of affairs was not of

      long duration: the unhappy prince fell suddenly into a fit of frenzy,

      which rendered him incapable of exercising his authority; and though he

      recovered from this disorder, he was so subject to relapses, that his

      judgment was gradually but sensibly impaired, and no steady plan of

      government could be pursued by him. The administration of affairs was

      disputed between his brother, Lewis, duke of Orleans, and his

      cousin-german, John, duke of Burgundy: the propinquity to the crown

      pleaded in favor of the former: the latter, who, in right of his mother,

      had inherited the county of Flanders, which he annexed to his father’s

      extensive dominions, derived a lustre from his superior power: the people

      were divided between these contending princes; and the king, now resuming,

      now dropping his authority, kept the victory undecided, and prevented any

      regular settlement of the state by the final prevalence of either party.

     

      At length, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, seeming to be moved by the

      cries of the nation, and by the interposition of common friends, agreed to

      bury all past quarrels in oblivion, and to enter into strict amity: they

      swore before the altar the sincerity of their friendship; the priest

      administered the sacrament to both of them; they gave to each other every

      pledge which could be deemed sacred among men: but all this solemn

      preparation was only a cover for the basest treachery, which was

      deliberately premeditated by the duke of Burgundy. He procured his rival

      to be assassinated in the streets of Paris: he endeavored for some time to

      conceal the part which he took in the crime; but being detected, he

      embraced a resolution still more criminal and more dangerous to society,

      by openly avowing and justifying it.[*]

     

      The parliament itself of Paris, the tribunal of justice, heard the

      harangues of the duke’s advocate in defence of assassination, which he

      termed tyrannicide; and that assembly, partly influenced by faction,

      partly overawed by power, pronounced no sentence of condemnation against

      this detestable doctrine.[*]

     

      The same question was afterwards agitated before the council of Constance;

      and it was with difficulty that a feeble decision in favor of the contrary

      opinion, was procured from these fathers of the church, the ministers of

      peace and of religion. But the mischievous effects of that tenet, had they

      been before anywise doubtful, appeared sufficiently from the present

      incidents. The commission of this crime, which destroyed all trust and

      security, rendered the war implacable between the French parties, and cut

      off every means of peace and accommodation. The princes of the blood,

      combining with the young duke of Orleans and his brothers, made violent

      war on the duke of Burgundy; and the unhappy king, seized sometimes by one

      party, sometimes by the other, transferred alternately to each of them the

      appearance of legal authority. The provinces were laid waste by mutual

      depredations: assassinations were every where committed, from the

      animosity of the several leaders; or, what was equally terrible,

      executions were ordered, without any legal or free trial, by pretended

      courts of judicature. The whole kingdom was distinguished into two

      parties, the Burgundians and the Armagnacs; so the adherents of the young

      duke of Orleans were called, from the count of Armagnac, father-in-law to

      that prince. The city of Paris, distracted between them, but inclining

      more to the Burgundians, was a perpetual scene of blood and violence; the

      king and royal family were often detained captives in the hands of the

      populace; their faithful ministers were butchered or imprisoned before

      their face; and it was dangerous for any man, amidst these enraged

      factions, to be distinguished by a strict adherence to the principles of

      probity and honor.

     

      During this scene of general violence, there rose into some consideration

      a body of men, which usually makes no figure in public transactions, even

      during the most peaceful times; and that was the university of Paris,

      whose opinion was sometimes demanded, and more frequently offered, in the

      multiplied disputes between the parties. The schism by which the church

      was at that time divided, and which occasioned frequent controversies in

      the university, had raised the professors to an unusual degree of

      importance; and this connection between literature and superstition had

      bestowed on the former a weight to which reason and knowledge are not of

      themselves anywise entitled among men. But there was another society,

      whose sentiments were much more decisive, at Paris,—the fraternity

      of butchers, who, under the direction of their ringleaders, had declared

      for the duke of Burgundy, and committed the most violent outrages against

      the opposite party. To counterbalance their power, the Armagnacs made

      interest with the fraternity of carpenters; the populace ranged themselves

      on one side or the other; and the fate of the capital depended on the

      prevalence of either party.

     

      The advantage which might be made of these confusions was easily perceived

      in England; and, according to the maxims which usually prevail among

      nations, it was determined to lay hold of the favorable opportunity. The

      late king, who was courted by both the French parties, fomented the

      quarrel, by alternately sending assistance to each; but the present

      sovereign, impelled by the vigor of youth and the ardor of ambition,

      determined to push his advantages to a greater length, and to carry

      violent war into that distracted kingdom. But while he was making

      preparations for this end, he tried to effect his purpose by negotiation;

      and he sent over ambassadors to Paris, offering a perpetual peace and

      alliance; but demanding Catharine, the French king’s daughter, in

      marriage, two millions of crowns as her portion, one million six hundred

      thousand as the arrears of King John’s ransom, and the immediate

      possession and full sovereignty of Normandy, and of all the other

      provinces which had been ravished from England by the arms of Philip

      Augustus; together with the superiority of Brittany and Flanders.[*] Such

      exorbitant demands show that he was sensible of the present miserable

      condition of France; and the terms offered by the French court, though

      much inferior, discover their consciousness of the same melancholy truth.

      They were willing to give him the princess in marriage, to pay him eight

      hundred thousand crowns, to resign the entire sovereignty of Guienne, and

      to annex to that province the country of Perigord, Rovergue Xaintonge, the

      Angoumois, and other territories.[**]

     

      It is reported by some historians, (see Hist. Croyl. Cont. p. 500,) that

      the dauphin, in derision of Henry’s claims and dissolute character, sent

      him a box of tennis balls; intimating, that these implements of play were

      better adapted to him than the instruments of war. But this story is by no

      means credible; rejected these conditions, and scarcely hoped that his own

      demands would be complied with, he never intermitted a moment his

      preparations for war; and having assembled a great fleet and army at

      Southampton, having invited all the nobility and military men of the

      kingdom to attend him by the hopes of glory and of conquest, he came to

      the sea-side with a purpose of embarking on his expedition.

     

      But while Henry was meditating conquests upon his neighbors, he

      unexpectedly found himself in danger from a conspiracy at home, which was

      happily detected in its infancy. The earl of Cambridge, second son of the

      late duke of York, having espoused the sister of the earl of Marche, had

      zealously embraced the interests of that family; and had held some

      conferences with Lord Scrope of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton,

      about the means of recovering to that nobleman his right to the crown of

      England. The conspirators, as soon as detected, acknowledged their guilt

      to the king; [*] and Henry proceeded without delay to their trial and

      condemnation. The utmost that could be expected of the best king in those

      ages, was, that he would so far observe the essentials of justice, as not

      to make an innocent person a victim to his severity; but as to the

      formalities of law, which are often as material as the essentials

      themselves, they were sacrificed without scruple to the least interest or

      convenience. A jury of commoners was summoned: the three conspirators were

      indicted before them: the constable of Southampton Castle swore that they

      had separately confessed their guilt to him: without other evidence, Sir

      Thomas Grey was condemned and executed; but as the earl of Cambridge and

      Lord Scrope pleaded the privilege of their peerage, Henry thought proper

      to summon a court of eighteen barons, in which the duke of Clarence

      presided: the evidence given before the jury was read to them: the

      prisoners, though one of them was a prince of the blood, were not

      examined, nor produced in court, nor heard in their own defence; but

      received sentence of death upon this proof, which was every way irregular

      and unsatisfactory; and the sentence was soon after executed. The earl of

      Marche was accused of having given his approbation to the conspiracy, and

      received a general pardon from the great offers made by the court of

      France show that they had already entertained a just idea of Henry’s

      character, as well as of their own situation.

     

      The successes which the arms of England have, in different ages, obtained

      over those of France, have been much owing to the favorable situation of

      the former kingdom. The English, happily seated in an island, could make

      advantage of every misfortune which attended their neighbors, and were

      little exposed to the danger of reprisals. They never left their own

      country but when they were conducted by a king of extraordinary genius, or

      found their enemy divided by intestine factions, or were supported by a

      powerful alliance on the continent; and as all these circumstances

      concurred at present to favor their enterprise, they had reason to expect

      from it proportionable success. The duke of Burgundy, expelled France by a

      combination of the princes, had been secretly soliciting the alliance of

      England; [**] and Henry knew that this prince, though he scrupled at first

      to join the inveterate enemy of his country, would willingly, if he saw

      any probability of success, both assist him with his Flemish subjects, and

      draw over to the same side all his numerous partisans in France. Trusting,

      therefore, to this circumstance, but without establishing any concert with

      the duke, he put to sea, and landed near Harfleur, at the head of an army

      of six thousand men at arms, and twenty-four thousand foot, mostly

      archers. He immediately began the siege of that place, which was valiantly

      defended by D’Estouteville, and under him by De Guitri, De Gaucourt, and

      others of the French nobility; but as the garrison was weak, and the

      fortifications in bad repair, the governor was at last obliged to

      capitulate; and he promised to surrender the place, if he received no

      succor before the eighteenth of September. The day came, and there was no

      appearance of a French army to relieve him. Henry, taking possession of

      the town, placed a garrison in it, and expelled all the French

      inhabitants, with an intention of peopling it anew with English.

     

      The fatigues of this siege, and the unusual heat of the season, had so

      wasted the English army, that Henry could enter on no further enterprise;

      and was obliged to think of returning into England. He had dismissed his

      transports, which could not anchor in an open road upon the enemy’s

      coasts; and he lay under a necessity of marching by land to Calais, before

      he could reach a place of safety. A numerous French army of fourteen

      thousand men at arms and forty thousand foot, was by this time assembled

      in Normandy under the constable D’Albret; a force which, if prudently

      conducted, was sufficient either to trample down the English in the open

      field, or to harass and reduce to nothing their small army, before they

      could finish so long and difficult a march. Henry, therefore, cautiously

      offered to sacrifice his conquest of Harfleur for a safe passage to

      Calais; but his proposal being rejected, he determined to make his way by

      valor and conduct through all the opposition of the enemy.[*] That he

      might not discourage his army by the appearance of flight, or expose them

      to those hazards which naturally attend precipitate marches, he made slow

      and deliberate journeys,[*] till he reached the Somme, which he purposed

      to pass at the ford of Blanquetague, the same place where Edward, in a

      like situation, had before escaped from Philip de Valois. But he found the

      ford rendered impassable by the precaution of the French general, and

      guarded by a strong body on the opposite bank;[*] and he was obliged to

      march higher up the river, in order to seek for a safe passage. He was

      continually harassed on his march by flying parties of the enemy; saw

      bodies of troops on the other side ready to oppose every attempt; his

      provisions were cut off; his soldiers languished with sickness and

      fatigue; and his affairs seemed to be reduced to a desperate situation;

      when he was so dexterous or so fortunate as to seize, by surprise, a

      passage near St. Quintin, which had not been sufficiently guarded; and he

      safely carried over his army.[**]

     

      Henry then bent his march northwards to Calais; but he was still exposed

      to great and imminent danger from the enemy, who had also passed the

      Somme, and threw themselves full in his way, with a purpose of

      intercepting his retreat. After he had passed the small river of Ternois

      at Blangi, he was surprised to observe from the heights the whole French

      army drawn up in the plains of Azincour, and so posted that it was

      impossible for him to proceed on his march without coming to an

      engagement. Nothing in appearance could be more unequal than the battle

      upon which his safety and all his fortunes now depended. The English army

      was little, more than half the number which had disembarked at Harfleur;

      and they labored under every discouragement and necessity. The enemy was

      four times more numerous; was headed by the dauphin and all the princes of

      the blood; and was plentifully supplied with provisions of every kind.

      Henry’s situation was exactly similar to that of Edward at Crecy, and that

      of the Black Prince at Poietiers; and the memory of these great events,

      inspiring the English with courage, made them hope for a like deliverance

      from their present difficulties. The king likewise observed the same

      prudent conduct which had been followed by these great commanders: he drew

      up his army on a narrow ground between two woods, which guarded each

      flank; and he patiently expected in that posture the attack of the

      enemy.[*] Had the French constable been able either to reason justly upon

      the present circumstances of the two armies, or to profit by past

      experience, he had declined a combat, and had waited till necessity,

      obliging the English to advance, had made them relinquish the advantages

      of their situation. But the impetuous valor of the nobility, and a vain

      confidence in superior numbers, brought on this fatal action, which proved

      the source of infinite calamities to their country. The French archers on

      horseback and their men at arms, crowded in their ranks, advanced upon the

      English archers, who had fixed palisadoes in their front to break the

      impression of the enemy, and who safely plied them, from behind that

      defence, with a shower of arrows, which nothing could resist.[**]

     

      The clay soil, moistened by some rain which had lately fallen, proved

      another obstacle to the force of the French cavalry: the wounded men and

      horses discomposed their ranks: the narrow compass in which they were pent

      hindered them from recovering any order: the whole army was a scene of

      confusion, terror, and dismay: and Henry, perceiving his advantage,

      ordered the English archers, who were light and unencumbered, to advance

      upon the enemy, and seize the moment of victory. They fell with their

      battle-axes upon the French, who, in their present posture, were incapable

      either of flying or of making defence: they hewed them in pieces without

      resistance:[*] and being seconded by the men at arms who also pushed on

      against the enemy, they covered the field with the killed, wounded,

      dismounted, and overthrown.

     

      After all appearance of opposition was over, the English had leisure to

      make prisoners; and having advanced with uninterrupted success to the open

      plain, they there saw the remains of the French rear guard, which still

      maintained the appearance of a line of battle. At the same time, they

      heard an alarm from behind: some gentlemen of Picardy, having collected

      about six hundred peasants, had fallen upon the English baggage, and were

      doing execution on the unarmed followers of the camp, who fled before

      them, Henry, seeing the enemy on all sides of him, began to entertain

      apprehensions from his prisoners; and he thought it necessary to issue

      general orders for putting them to death: but on discovering the truth, he

      stopped the slaughter, and was still able to save a great number.

     

      No battle was ever more fatal to France, by the number of princes and

      nobility slain or taken prisoners. Among the former were the constable

      himself, the count of Nevers and the duke of Brabant, brothers to the duke

      of Burgundy; the count of Vaudemont, brother to the duke of Lorraine, the

      duke of AlenÃ§on, the duke of Barre, the count of Marle. The most eminent

      prisoners were the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the Counts d’Eu, VendÃ´me,

      and Richemont, and the mareschal of Boucicaut. An archbishop of Sens also

      was slain in this battle. The killed are computed on the whole to have

      amounted to ten thousand men; and as the slaughter fell chiefly upon the

      cavalry, it is pretended that, of these, eight thousand were gentlemen.

      Henry was master of fourteen thousand prisoners. The person of chief note

      who fell among the English, was the duke of York, who perished fighting by

      the king’s side, and had an end more honorable than his life. He was

      succeeded in his honors and fortune by his nephew, son of the earl of

      Cambridge, executed in the beginning of the year. All the English who were

      slain exceeded not forty; though some writers, with greater probability,

      make the number more considerable.

     

      The three great battles of Crecy, Poictiers, and Azincour bear a singular

      resemblance to each other in their most considerable circumstances. In all

      of them there appears the same temerity in the English princes, who,

      without any object of moment, merely for the sake of plunder, had ventured

      so far into the enemy’s country as to leave themselves no retreat; and

      unless saved by the utmost imprudence in the French commanders, were, from

      their very situation, exposed to inevitable destruction. But allowance

      being made for this temerity, which, according to the irregular plans of

      war followed in those ages, seems to have been, in some measure,

      unavoidable there appears, in the day of action, the same presence of

      mind, dexterity, courage, firmness, and precaution on the part of the

      English; the same precipitation, confusion, and vain confidence on the

      part of the French: and the events were such as might have been expected

      from such opposite conduct. The immediate consequences too of these three

      great victories were similar: instead of pushing the French with vigor,

      and taking advantage of their consternation, the English princes, after

      their victory, seem rather to have relaxed their efforts, and to have

      allowed the enemy leisure to recover from his losses. Henry interrupted

      not his march a moment after the battle of Azincour; he carried his

      prisoners to Calais, thence to England; he even concluded a truce with the

      enemy; and it was not till after an interval of two years that any body of

      English troops appeared in France.

     

      The poverty of all the European princes, and the small resources of their

      kingdoms, were the cause of these continual interruptions in their

      hostilities; and though the maxims of war were in general destructive,

      their military operations were mere incursions, which, without any settled

      plan, they carried on against each other. The lustre, however, attending

      the victory of Azincour, procured some supplies from the English

      parliament; though still unequal to the expenses of a campaign. They

      granted Henry an entire fifteenth of movables; and they conferred on him

      for life the duties of tonnage and poundage, and the subsidies on the

      exportation of wool and leather. This concession is more considerable than

      that which had been granted to Richard II. by his last parliament and

      which was afterwards, on his deposition, made so great an article of

      charge against him.

     

      But during this interruption of hostilities from England, France was

      exposed to all the furies of civil war, and the several parties became

      every day more enraged against each other. The duke of Burgundy, confident

      that the French ministers and generals were entirely discredited by the

      misfortune at Azincour, advanced with a great army to Paris, and attempted

      to reinstate himself in possession of the government, as well as of the

      person of the king. But his partisans in that city were overawed by the

      court, and kept in subjection: the duke despaired of success; and he

      retired with his forces, which he immediately disbanded in the Low

      Countries.[*]

     

      1417.

     

      He was soon after invited to make a new attempt, by some violent quarrels

      which broke out in the royal family. The queen, Isabella, daughter of the

      duke of Bavaria, who had been hitherto an inveterate enemy to the

      Burgundian faction, had received a great injury from the other party,

      which the implacable spirit of that princess was never able to forgive.

      The public necessities obliged the count of Armagnac, created constable of

      France in the place of D’Albret, to seize the great treasures which

      Isabella had amassed: and when she expressed her displeasure at this

      injury, he inspired into the weak mind of the king some jealousies

      concerning her conduct, and pushed him to seize, and put to the torture,

      and afterwards throw into the Seine, Boisbourdon, her favorite, whom he

      accused of a commerce of gallantry with that princess. The queen herself

      was sent to Tours, and confined under a guard;[**] and after suffering

      these multiplied insults, she no longer scrupled to enter into a

      correspondence with the duke of Burgundy. As her son, the dauphin Charles,

      a youth of sixteen, was entirely governed by the faction of Armagnac, she

      extended her animosity to him, and sought his destruction with the most

      unrelenting hatred. She had soon an opportunity of rendering her unnatural

      purpose effectual. The duke of Burgundy, in concert with her, entered

      France at the head of a great army: he made himself master of Amiens,

      Abbeville, Dourlens, Montreuil, and other towns in Picardy; Senlis,

      Rheims, Chalons, Troye, and Auxerre, declared themselves of his

      party.[***] He got possession of Beaumont, Pontoise, Vernon, Meulant,

      Montlheri, towns in the neighborhood of Paris; and carrying further his

      progress towards the west, he seized Etampes, Chartres, and other

      fortresses; and was at last able to deliver the queen, who fled to Troye,

      and openly declared against those ministers who, she said, detained her

      husband in captivity.[****]

     

      Meanwhile the partisans of Burgundy raised a commotion in Paris, which

      always inclined to that faction. Lile-Adam, one of the duke’s captains,

      was received into the city in the night-time, and headed the insurrection

      of the people, which in a moment became so impetuous that nothing could

      oppose it. The person of the king was seized: the dauphin made his escape

      with difficulty; great numbers of the faction of Armagnac were immediately

      butchered: the count himself, and many persons of note, were thrown into

      prison: murders were daily committed from private animosity, under

      pretence of faction: and the populace, not satiated with their fury, and

      deeming the course of public justice too dilatory, broke into the prisons,

      and put to death the count of Armagnac, and all the other nobility who

      were there confined.[*]

     

      1418.

     

      While France was in such furious combustion, and was so ill prepared to

      resist a foreign enemy, Henry, having collected some treasure and levied

      an army, landed in Normandy at the head of twenty-five thousand men; and

      met with no considerable opposition from any quarter. He made himself

      master of Falaise; Evreux and Caen submitted to him; Pont de l’Arche

      opened its gates; and Henry, having subdued all the lower Normandy, and

      having received a reÃ«nforcement of fifteen thousand men from England,[**]

      formed the siege of Rouen, which was defended by a garrison of four

      thousand men, seconded by the inhabitants, to the number of fifteen

      thousand.[***] The cardinal des Ursins here attempted to incline him

      towards peace, and to moderate his pretensions; but the king replied to

      him in such terms as showed that he was fully sensible of all his present

      advantages: “Do you not see,” said he, “that God has led me hither as by

      the hand? France has no sovereign: I have just pretensions to that

      kingdom: every thing is here in the utmost confusion: no one thinks of

      resisting me. Can I have a more sensible proof, that the Being who

      disposes of empires has determined to put the crown of France upon my

      head?”[****]

     

      But though Henry had opened his mind to this scheme of ambition, he still

      continued to negotiate with his enemies, and endeavored to obtain more

      secure, though less considerable advantages. He made, at the same time,

      offers of peace to both parties; to the queen and duke of Burgundy on the

      one hand, who, having possession of the king’s person, carried the

      appearance of legal authority;[*] and to the dauphin on the other, who,

      being the undoubted heir of the monarchy, was adhered to by every one that

      paid any regard to the true interests of their country.[****] These two

      parties also carried on a continual negotiation with each other. The terms

      proposed on all sides were perpetually varying: the events of the war and

      the intrigues of the cabinet intermingled with each other: and the fate of

      France remained long in this uncertainty. After many negotiations, Henry

      offered the queen and the duke of Burgundy to make peace with them, to

      espouse the Princess Catharine, and to accept of all the provinces ceded

      to Edward III. by the treaty of Bretigni, with the addition of Normandy,

      which he was to receive in full and entire sovereignty.[*]

     

      1419.

     

      These terms were submitted to: there remained only some circumstances to

      adjust, in order to the entire completion of the treaty; but in this

      interval the duke of Burgundy secretly finished his treaty with the

      dauphin; and these two princes agreed to share the royal authority during

      King Charles’s lifetime, and to unite their arms in order to expel foreign

      enemies.[****]

     

      This alliance which seemed to cut off from Henry all hopes of further

      success, proved in the issue the most favorable event that could have

      happened for his pretensions. Whether the dauphin and the duke of Burgundy

      were ever sincere in their mutual engagements, is uncertain; but very

      fatal effects resulted from their momentary and seeming union. The two

      princes agreed to an interview, in order to concert the means of rendering

      effectual their common attack on the English; but how both or either of

      them could with safety venture upon this conference, it seemed somewhat

      difficult to contrive. The assassination perpetrated by the duke of

      Burgundy, and still more his open avowal of the deed, and defence of the

      doctrine, tended to dissolve all the bands of civil society; and even men

      of honor, who detested the example, might deem it just, on a favorable

      opportunity, to retaliate upon the author. The duke, therefore, who

      neither dared to give, nor could pretend to expect, any trust, agreed to

      all the contrivances for mutual security which were proposed by the

      ministers of the dauphin. The two princes came to Montereau: the duke

      lodged in the Castle; the dauphin in the town, which was divided from the

      castle by the River Yonne: the bridge between them was chosen for the

      place of interview: two high rails were drawn across the bridge: the gates

      on each side were guarded, one by the officers of the dauphin, the other

      by those of the duke: the princes were to enter into the intermediate

      space by the opposite gates, accompanied each by ten persons; and with all

      these marks of diffidence, to conciliate their mutual friendship. But it

      appeared that no precautions are sufficient where laws have no place, and

      where all principles of honor are utterly abandoned. Tannegui de Chatel,

      and others of the dauphin’s retainers, had been zealous partisans of the

      late duke of Orleans; and they determined to seize the opportunity of

      revenging on the assassin the murder of that prince; they no sooner

      entered the rails, than they drew their swords and attacked the duke of

      Burgundy; his friends were astonished and thought not of making any

      defence; and all of them either shared his fate, or were taken prisoners

      by the retinue of the dauphin.[*]

     

      The extreme youth of this prince made it doubtful whether he had been

      admitted into the secret of the conspiracy; but as the deed was committed

      under his eye, by his most intimate friends, who still retained their

      connections with him, the blame of the action, which was certainly more

      imprudent than criminal, fell entirely upon him. The whole state of

      affairs was every where changed by this unexpected incident. The city of

      Paris, passionately devoted to the family of Burgundy, broke out into the

      highest fury against the dauphin. The court of King Charles entered from

      interest into the same views; and as all the ministers of that monarch had

      owed their preferment to the late duke, and foresaw their downfall if the

      dauphin should recover possession of his father’s person, they were

      concerned to prevent by any means the success of his enterprise. The

      queen, persevering in her unnatural animosity against her son, increased

      the general flame, and inspired into the king, as far as he was

      susceptible of any sentiment the same prejudices by which she herself had

      long been actuated. But above all, Philip, count of Charolois, now duke of

      Burgundy, thought himself bound by every tie of honor and of duty to

      revenge the murder of his father, and to prosecute the assassin to the

      utmost extremity. And in this general transport of rage, every

      consideration of national and family interest was buried in oblivion by

      all parties: the subjection to a foreign enemy, the expulsion of the

      lawful heir, the slavery of the kingdom, appeared but small evils, if they

      led to the gratification of the present passion.

     

      The king of England had, before the death of the duke of Burgundy,

      profited extremely by the distractions of France and was daily making a

      considerable progress in Normandy. He had taken Rouen after an obstinate

      siege:[*] he had made himself master of Pontoise and Gisors: he even

      threatened Paris, and by the terror of his arms had obliged the court to

      remove to Troye: and in the midst of his successes, he was agreeably

      surprised to find his enemies, instead of combining against him for their

      mutual defence, disposed to rush into his arms, and to make him the

      instrument of their vengeance upon each other. A league was immediately

      concluded at Arras between him and the duke of Burgundy. This prince,

      without stipulating any thing for himself, except the prosecution of his

      father’s murder, and the marriage of the duke of Bedford with his sister,

      was willing to sacrifice the kingdom to Henry’s ambition; and he agreed to

      every demand made by that monarch.

     

      1420.

     

      In order to finish this astonishing treaty, which was to transfer the

      crown of France to a stranger, Henry went to Troye, accompanied by his

      brothers, the dukes of Clarence and Glocester; and was there met by the

      duke of Burgundy. The imbecility into which Charles had fallen, made him

      incapable of seeing any thing but through the eyes of those who attended

      him; as they, on their part, saw every thing through the medium of their

      passions. The treaty, being already concerted among the parties, was

      immediately drawn, and signed, and ratified: Henry’s will seemed to be a

      law throughout the whole negotiation: nothing was attended to but his

      advantages.

     

      The principal articles of the treaty were, that Henry should espouse the

      Princess Catharine: that King Charles, during his lifetime, should enjoy

      the title and dignity of king of France: that Henry should be declared and

      acknowledged heir of the monarchy, and be intrusted with the present

      administration of the government: that that kingdom should pass to his

      heirs general: that France and England should forever be united under one

      king; but should still retain their several usages, customs, and

      privileges: that all the princes, peers, vassals, and communities of

      France should swear, that they would both adhere to the future succession

      of Henry, and pay him present obedience as regent: that this prince should

      unite his arms to those of King Charles and the duke of Burgundy, in order

      to subdue the adherents of Charles, the pretended dauphin: and that these

      three princes should make no peace or truce with him but by common consent

      and agreement.[*]

     

      Such was the tenor of this famous treaty; a treaty which, as nothing but

      the most violent animosity could dictate it, so nothing but the power of

      the sword could carry into execution. It is hard to say whether its

      consequences, had it taken effect, would have proved more pernicious to

      England or to France. It must have reduced the former kingdom to the rank

      of a province: it would have entirely disjointed the succession of the

      latter, and have brought on the destruction of every descendant of the

      royal family; as the houses of Orleans, Anjou, AlenÃ§on, Brittany, Bourbon,

      and of Burgundy itself, whose titles were preferable to that of the

      English princes, would on that account have been exposed to perpetual

      jealousy and persecution from the sovereign. There was even a palpable

      deficiency in Henry’s claim, which no art could palliate. For, besides the

      insuperable objections to which Edward III.‘s pretensions were exposed, he

      was not heir to that monarch: if female succession were admitted, the

      right had devolved on the house of Mortimer: allowing that Richard II. was

      a tyrant, and that Henry IV.‘s merits in deposing him were so great

      towards the English, as to justify that nation in placing him on the

      throne, Richard had nowise offended France, and his rival had merited

      nothing of that kingdom: it could not possibly be pretended, that the

      crown of France was become an appendage to that of England; and that a

      prince, who by any means got possession of the latter, was, without

      further question, entitled to the former. So that, on the whole, it must

      be allowed that Henry’s claim to France was, if possible, still more

      unintelligible than the title by which his father had mounted the throne

      of England.

     

      But though all these considerations were overlooked, amidst the hurry of

      passion by which the courts of France and Burgundy were actuated, they

      would necessarily revive during times of more tranquillity; and it behoved

      Henry to push his present advantages, and allow men no leisure for reason

      or reflection. In a few days after, he espoused the Princess Catharine: he

      carried his father-in-law to Paris, and put himself in possession of that

      capital: he obtained from the parliament and the three estates a

      ratification of the treaty of Troye: he supported the duke of Burgundy in

      procuring a sentence against the murderers of his father: and he

      immediately turned his arms with success against the adherents of the

      dauphin, who, as soon as he heard of the treaty of Troye, took on him the

      style and authority of regent, and appealed to God and his sword for the

      maintenance of his title.

     

      The first place that Henry subdued was Sens, which opened its gates after

      a slight resistance. With the same facility he made himself master of

      Montereau. The defence of Melun was more obstinate: Barbasan, the

      governor, held out for the space of four months against the besiegers; and

      it was famine alone which obliged him to capitulate. Henry stipulated to

      spare the lives of all the garrison, except such as were accomplices in

      the murder of the duke of Burgundy; and as Barbasan himself was suspected

      to be of the number, his punishment was demanded by Philip: but the king

      had the generosity to intercede for him, and to prevent his execution.[*]

     

      1421.

     

      The necessity of providing supplies both of men and money, obliged Henry

      to go over to England; and he left the duke of Exeter, his uncle, governor

      of Paris during his absence. The authority which naturally attends

      success, procured from the English parliament a subsidy of a fifteenth;

      but, if we may judge by the scantiness of the supply, the nation was

      nowise sanguine on their king’s victories; and in proportion as the

      prospect of their union with France became nearer, they began to open

      their eyes, and to see the dangerous consequences with which that event

      must necessarily be attended. It was fortunate for Henry that he had other

      resources, besides pecuniary supplies from his native subjects. The

      provinces which he had already conquered maintained his troops; and the

      hopes of further advantages allured to his standard all men of ambitious

      spirits in England, who desired to signalize themselves by arms. He levied

      a new army of twenty-four thousand archers and four thousand horsemen,[**]

      and marched them to Dover, the place of rendezvous.

     

      Every thing had remained in tranquillity at Paris under the duke of Exeter

      but there had happened, in another quarter of the kingdom, a misfortune

      which hastened the king’s embarkation.

     

      The detention of the young king of Scots in England had hitherto proved

      advantageous to Henry; and by keeping the regent in awe, had preserved,

      during the whole course of the French war, the northern frontier in

      tranquillity. But when intelligence arrived in Scotland of the progress

      made by Henry, and the near prospect of his succession to the crown of

      France, the nation was alarmed, and foresaw their own inevitable ruin, if

      the subjection of their ally left them to combat alone a victorious enemy,

      who was already so much superior in power and riches. The regent entered

      into the same views; and though he declined an open rupture with England,

      he permitted a body of seven thousand Scots, under the command of the earl

      of Buchan, his second son, to be transported into France for the service

      of the dauphin. To render this aid ineffectual, Henry had, in his former

      expedition, carried over the king of Scots, whom he obliged to send orders

      to his countrymen to leave the French service; but the Scottish general

      replied, that he would obey no commands which came from a king in

      captivity, and that a prince, while in the hands of his enemy, was nowise

      entitled to authority. These troops, therefore, continued still to act

      under the earl of Buchan: and were employed by the dauphin to oppose the

      progress of the duke of Clarence in Anjou. The two armies encountered at

      BaugÃ©: the English were defeated: the duke himself was slain by Sir Allan

      Swinton, a Scotch knight, who commanded a company of men at arms: and the

      earls of Somerset,[*] Dorset, and Huntingdon were taken prisoners.[**]

      This was the first action that turned the tide of success against the

      English; and the dauphin, that he might both attach the Scotch to his

      service, and reward the valor and conduct of the earl of Buchan, honored

      that nobleman with the office of constable.

     

      But the arrival of the king of England with so considerable an army, was

      more than sufficient to repair this loss. Henry was received at Paris with

      great expressions of joy, so obstinate were the prejudices of the people;

      and he immediately conducted his army to Chartres, which had long been

      besieged by the dauphin. That prince raised the siege on the approach of

      the English; and being resolved to decline a battle, he retired with his

      army.[*] Henry made himself master of Dreux without a blow: he laid siege

      to Meaux, at the Solicitation of the Parisians, who were much incommoded

      by the garrison of that place. This enterprise employed the English arms

      during the space of eight months: the bastard of Vaurus, governor of

      Meaux, distinguished himself by an obstinate defence; but was at last

      obliged to surrender at discretion. The cruelty of this officer was equal

      to his bravery: he was accustomed to hang, without distinction, all the

      English and Burgundians who fell into his hands: and Henry, in revenge of

      his barbarity, ordered him immediately to be hanged on the same tree which

      he had made the instrument of his inhuman executions.[**]

     

      This success was followed by the surrender of many other places in the

      neighborhood of Paris, which held for the dauphin: that prince was chased

      beyond the Loire, and he almost totally abandoned all the northern

      provinces: he was even pursued into the south by the united arms of the

      English and Burgundians, and threatened with total destruction.

      Notwithstanding the bravery and fidelity of his captains, he saw himself

      unequal to his enemies in the field; and found it necessary to temporize,

      and to avoid all hazardous actions with a rival who had gained so much the

      ascendant over him. And to crown all the other prosperities of Henry, his

      queen was delivered of a son, who was called by his father’s name, and

      whose birth was celebrated by rejoicings no less pompous, and no less

      sincere, at Paris than at London. The infant prince seemed to be

      universally regarded as the future heir of both monarchies.

     

      1422.

     

      But the glory of Henry, when it had nearly reached the summit, was stopped

      short by the hand of nature; and all his mighty projects vanished into

      smoke. He was seized with a fistula, a malady which the surgeons at that

      time had not skill enough to cure; and he was at last sensible that his

      distemper was mortal, and that his end was approaching He sent for his

      brother the duke of Bedford, the earl of Warwick, and a few noblemen more,

      whom he had honored with his friendship; and he delivered to them, in

      great tranquillity, his last will with regard to the government of his

      kingdom and family. He entreated them to continue towards his infant son

      the same fidelity and attachment which they had always professed to

      himself during his lifetime, and which had been cemented by so many mutual

      good offices. He expressed his indifference on the approach of death; and

      though he regretted that he must leave unfinished a work so happily begun,

      he declared himself confident that the final acquisition of France would

      be the effect of their prudence and valor. He left the regency of that

      kingdom to his elder brother, the duke of Bedford; that of England to his

      younger, the duke of Glocester; and the care of his son’s person to the

      earl of Warwick. He recommended to all of them a great attention to

      maintain the friendship of the duke of Burgundy; and advised them never to

      give liberty to the French princes taken at Azincour, till his son were of

      age, and could himself hold the reins of government. And he conjured them,

      if the success of their arms should not enable them to place young Henry

      on the throne of France, never at least to make peace with that kingdom,

      unless the enemy, by the cession of Normandy, and its annexation to the

      crown of England, made compensation for all the hazard and expense of his

      enterprise.[*]

     

      He next applied himself to his devotions, and ordered his chaplain to

      recite the seven penitential psalms. When that passage of the fifty-first

      psalm was read, “build thou the walls of Jerusalem,” he interrupted the

      chaplain, and declared his serious intention, after he should have fully

      subdued France, to conduct a crusade against the infidels, and recover

      possession of the Holy Land.[**] So ingenious are men in deceiving

      themselves, that Henry forgot, in those moments, all the blood spilt by

      his ambition; and received comfort from this late and feeble resolve,

      which, as the mode of these enterprises was now passed, he certainly would

      never have carried into execution. He expired in the thirty-fourth year of

      his age and the tenth of his reign.

     

      This prince possessed many eminent virtues; and if we give indulgence to

      ambition in a monarch, or rank it, as the vulgar are inclined to do, among

      his virtues, they were unstained by any considerable blemish. His

      abilities appeared equally in the cabinet and in the field: the boldness

      of his enterprises was no less remarkable than his personal valor in

      conducting them. He had the talent of attaching his friends by affability,

      and of gaining his enemies by address and clemency. The English, dazzled

      by the lustre of his character, still more than by that of his victories,

      were reconciled to the defects in his title: the French almost forgot that

      he was an enemy: and his care in maintaining justice in his civil

      administration, and preserving discipline in his armies, made some amends

      to both nations for the calamities inseparable from those wars in which

      his short reign was almost entirely occupied, That he could forgive the

      earl of Marche, who had a better title to the crown than himself, is a

      sure indication of his magnanimity; and that the earl relied so entirely

      on his friendship, is no less a proof of his established character for

      candor and sincerity. There remain in history few instances of such mutual

      trust; and still fewer where neither party found reason to repent it.

     

      The exterior figure of this great prince, as well as his deportment, was

      engaging. His stature was somewhat above the middle size; his countenance

      beautiful; his limbs genteel and slender, but full of vigor; and he

      excelled in all warlike and manly exercises.[*] He left by his queen,

      Catharine of France, only one son, not full nine months old; whose

      misfortunes, in the course of his life, surpassed all the glories and

      successes of his father.

     

      In less than two months after Henry’s death, Charles VI. of France, his

      father-in-law, terminated his unhappy life. He had for several years

      possessed only the appearance of royal authority: yet was this mere

      appearance of considerable advantage to the English; and divided the duty

      and affections of the French between them and the dauphin. This prince was

      proclaimed and crowned king of France at Poictiers, by the name of Charles

      VII. Rheims, the place where this ceremony is usually performed, was at

      that time in the hands of his enemies.

     

      Catharine of France, Henry’s widow, married, soon after his death, a Welsh

      gentleman, Sir Owen Tudor, said to be descended from the ancient princes

      of that country: she bore him two sons, Edmund and Jasper, of whom the

      eldest was created earl of Richmond; the second earl of Pembroke The

      family of Tudor, first raised to distinction by this alliance, mounted

      afterwards the throne of England.

     

      The long schism, which had divided the Latin church for near forty years,

      was finally terminated in this reign by the council of Constance; which

      deposed the pope, John XXIII., for his crimes, and elected Martin V. in

      his place, who was acknowledged by almost all the kingdoms of Europe. This

      great and unusual act of authority in the council, gave the Roman pontiffs

      ever after a mortal antipathy to those assemblies. The same jealousy which

      had long prevailed in most European countries, between the civil

      aristocracy and monarchy, now also took place between these powers in the

      ecclesiastical body. But the great separation of the bishops in the

      several states, and the difficulty of assembling them, gave the pope a

      mighty advantage, and made it more easy for him to centre all the powers

      of the hierarchy in his own person. The cruelty and treachery which

      attended the punishment of John Huss and Jerome of Prague, the unhappy

      disciples of Wickliffe, who, in violation of a safe-conduct were burned

      alive for their errors by the council of Constance prove this melancholy

      truth, that toleration is none of the virtues of priests in any form of

      ecclesiastical government But as the English nation had little or no

      concern in these great transactions, we are here the more concise in

      relating them.

     

      The first commission of array which we meet with, was issued in this

      reign.[*] The military part of the feudal system, which was the most

      essential circumstance of it, was entirely dissolved, and could no longer

      serve for the defence of the kingdom. Henry, therefore, when he went to

      France, in 1415, empowered certain commissioners to take in each county a

      review of all the freemen able to bear arms, to divide them into

      companies, and to keep them in readiness for resisting an enemy. This was

      the era when the feudal militia in England gave place to one which was

      perhaps still less orderly and regular.

     

      * Rymer, vol, ix. p. 254, 255.

     

      We have an authentic and exact account of the ordinary revenue of the

      crown during this reign; and it amounts only to fifty-five thousand seven

      hundred and fourteen pounds ten shillings and tenpence a year. [*] This is

      nearly the same with the revenue of Henry III.; and the kings of England

      had neither become much richer nor poorer in the course of so many years.

      The ordinary expense of the government amounted to forty-two thousand five

      hundred and seven pounds sixteen shillings and tenpence; so that the king

      had a surplus only of thirteen thousand two hundred and six pounds

      fourteen shillings for the support of his household; for his wardrobe; for

      the expense of embassies; and other articles. This sum was nowise

      sufficient: he was therefore obliged to have frequent recourse to

      parliamentary supplies, and was thus, even in time of peace, not

      altogether independent of his people. But wars were attended with a great

      expense, which neither the prince’s ordinary revenue, nor the

      extraordinary supplies, were able to bear; and the sovereign was always

      reduced to many miserable shifts, in order to make any tolerable figure in

      them. He commonly borrowed money from all quarters; he pawned his jewels,

      and sometimes the crown itself;[**] he ran in arrears to his army; and he

      was often obliged, notwithstanding all these expedients, to stop in the

      midst of his career of victory, and to grant truces to the enemy. The high

      pay which was given to soldiers agreed very ill with this low income. All

      the extraordinary supplies, granted by parliament to Henry during the

      course of his reign, were only seven tenths and fifteenths, about two

      hundred and three thousand pounds.[***] It is easy to compute how soon

      this money must be exhausted by armies of twenty-four thousand archers and

      six thousand horse; when each archer had sixpence a day,[****] and each

      horseman two shillings. The most splendid successes proved commonly

      fruitless when supported by so poor a revenue; and the debts and

      difficulties which the king thereby incurred, made him pay dear for his

      victories. The civil administration, likewise, even in time of peace,

      could never be very regular, where the government was so ill enabled to

      support itself.

     

      Henry, till within a year of his death, owed debts which he had contracted

      when prince of Wales.[*] It was in vain that the parliament pretended to

      restrain him from arbitrary practices, when he was reduced to such

      necessities. Though the right of levying purveyance for instance, had been

      expressly guarded against by the Great Charter itself, and was frequently

      complained of by the commons, it was found absolutely impracticable to

      abolish it; and the parliament at length, submitting to it as a legal

      prerogative, contented themselves with enacting laws to limit and confine

      it. The duke of Glocester, in the reign of Richard II., possessed a

      revenue of sixty thousand crowns, (about thirty thousand pounds a year of

      our present money,) as we learn from Froissard,[**] and was consequently

      richer than the king himself, if all circumstances be duly considered.

     

      It is remarkable, that the city of Calais alone was an annual expense to

      the crown of nineteen thousand one hundred and nineteen pounds;[***] that

      is, above a third of the common charge of the government in time of peace.

      This fortress was of no use to the defence of England, and only gave that

      kingdom an inlet to annoy France. Ireland cost two thousand pounds a year,

      over and above its own revenue; which was certainly very low. Every thing

      conspires to give us a very mean idea of the state of Europe in those

      ages.

     

      From the most early times till the reign of Edward III., the denomination

      of money had never been altered; a pound sterling was still a pound troy;

      that is, about three pounds of our present money. That conqueror was the

      first that innovated in this important article. In the twentieth of his

      reign, he coined twenty-two shillings from a pound troy; in his

      twenty-seventh year, he coined twenty-five shillings. But Henry V., who

      was also a conqueror, raised still farther the denomination, and counted

      thirty shillings from a pound troy:[****] his revenue therefore must have

      been about one hundred and ten thousand pounds of our present money; and

      by the cheapness of provisions, was equivalent to above three hundred and

      thirty thousand pounds.

     

      None of the princes of the house of Lancaster ventured to impose taxes

      without consent of parliament: their doubtful or bad title became so far

      of advantage to the constitution. The rule was then fixed, and could not

      safely be broken afterwards, even by more absolute princes
