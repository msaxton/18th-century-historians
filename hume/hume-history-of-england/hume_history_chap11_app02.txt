The feudal law is the chief foundation both of the political government

      and of the jurisprudence established by the Normans in England. Our

      subject therefore requires that we should form a just idea of this law, in

      order to explain the state, as well of that kingdom, as of all other

      kingdoms of Europe, which during those ages were governed by similar

      institutions. And though I am sensible that I must here repeat many

      observations and reflections which have been communicated by others, yet

      as every book, agreeably to the observation of a great historian, should

      be as complete as possible within itself, and should never refer for any

      thing material to other books, it will be necessary in this place to

      deliver a short plan of that prodigious fabric, which for several

      centuries preserved such a mixture of liberty and oppression, order and

      anarchy, stability and revolution, as was never experienced in any other

      age or any other part of the world.

     

      After the northern nations had subdued the provinces of the Roman empire,

      they were obliged to establish a system of government which might secure

      their conquests, as well against the revolt of their numerous subjects who

      remained in the provinces, as from the inroads of other tribes, who might

      be tempted to ravish from them their new acquisitions. The great change of

      circumstances made them here depart from those institutions which

      prevailed among them while they remained in the forests of Germany; yet

      was it still natural for them to retain, in their present settlement, as

      much of their ancient customs as was compatible with their new situation.

     

      The German governments, being more a confederacy of independent warriors

      than a civil subjection, derived their principal force from many inferior

      and voluntary associations which individuals formed under a particular

      head or chieftain, and which it became the highest point of honor to

      maintain with inviolable fidelity. The glory of the chief consisted in the

      number, the bravery, and the zealous attachment of his retainers; the duty

      of the retainers required that they should accompany their chief in all

      wars and dangers, that they should fight and perish by his side, and that

      they should esteem his renown or his favor a sufficient recompense for all

      their services.[*] The prince himself was nothing but a great chieftain,

      who was chosen from among the rest on account of his superior valor or

      nobility; and who derived his power from the voluntary association or

      attachment of the other chieftains.

     

      When a tribe, governed by these ideas, and actuated by these principles,

      subdued a large territory, they found that, though it was necessary to

      keep themselves in a military posture, they could neither remain united in

      a body, nor take up their quarters in several garrisons, and that their

      manners and institutions debarred them from using these expedients the

      obvious ones, which, in a like situation, would have been employed by a

      more civilized nation. Their ignorance in the art of finances, and perhaps

      the devastations inseparable from such violent conquests, rendered it

      impracticable for them to levy taxes sufficient for the pay of numerous

      armies; and their repugnance to subordination, with their attachment to

      rural pleasures, made the life of the camp or garrison, if perpetuated

      during peaceful times, extremely odious and disgustful to them. They

      seized, therefore, such a portion of the conquered lands as appeared

      necessary; they assigned a share for supporting the dignity of their

      prince and government; they distributed other parts, under the title of

      fiefs, to the chiefs; these made a new partition among their retainers;

      the express condition of all these grants was, that they might be resumed

      at pleasure, and that the possessor, so long as he enjoyed them, should

      still remain in readiness to take the field for the defence of the nation.

      And though the conquerors immediately separated, in order to enjoy their

      new acquisitions, their martial disposition made them readily fulfil the

      terms of their engagement: they assembled on the first alarm; their

      habitual attachment to the chieftain made them willingly submit to his

      command; and thus a regular military force though concealed was always

      ready to defend, on any emergency, the interest and honor of the

      community.

     

      We are not to imagine, that all the conquered lands were seized by the

      northern conquerors, or that the whole of the land thus seized was

      subjected to those military services. This supposition is confuted by the

      history of all the nations on the continent. Even the idea given us of the

      German manners by the Roman historian, may convince us, that that bold

      people would never have been content with so precarious a subsistence, or

      have fought to procure establishments which were only to continue during

      the good pleasure of their sovereign. Though the northern chieftains

      accepted of lands which, being considered as a kind of military pay, might

      be resumed at the will of the king or general, they also took possession

      of estates which, being hereditary and independent, enabled them to

      maintain their native liberty, and support, without court favor, the honor

      of their rank and family.

     

      But there is a great difference, in the consequences, between the

      distribution of a pecuniary subsistence, and the assignment of lands

      burdened with the condition of military service. The delivery of the

      former, at the weekly, monthly, or annual terms of payment, still recalls

      the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince, and reminds the soldier

      of the precarious tenure by which he holds his commission. But the

      attachment, naturally formed with a fixed portion of land, gradually

      begets the idea of something like property, and makes the possessor forget

      his dependent situation, and the condition which was at first annexed to

      the grant. It seemed equitable, that one who had cultivated and sowed a

      field, should reap the harvest: hence fiefs, which were at first entirely

      precarious were soon made annual. A man who had employed his money in

      building, planting, or other improvements, expected to reap the fruits of

      his labor or expense: hence they were next granted during a term of years.

      It would be thought hard to expel a man from his possessions who had

      always done his duty, and performed the conditions on which he originally

      received them: hence the chieftains, in a subsequent period, thought

      themselves entitled to demand the enjoyment of their feudal lands during

      life. It was found, that a man would more willingly expose himself in

      battle, if assured that his family should inherit his possessions, and

      should not be left by his death in want and poverty; hence fiefs were made

      hereditary in families, and descended, during one age to the son, then to

      the grandson, next to the brothers, and afterwards to more distant

      relations.[*] The idea of property stole in gradually upon that of

      military pay; and each century made some sensible addition to the

      stability of fiefs and tenures.

     

      In all these successive acquisitions, the chief was supported by his

      vassals; who, having originally a strong connection with him, augmented by

      the constant intercourse of good offices, and by the friendship arising

      from vicinity and dependence, were inclined to follow their leader against

      all his enemies, and voluntarily, in his private quarrels, paid him the

      same obedience to which, by their tenure, they were bound in foreign wars.

      While he daily advanced new pretensions to secure the possession of his

      superior fief, they expected to find the same advantage in acquiring

      stability to their subordinate ones; and they zealously opposed the

      intrusion of a new lord, who would be inclined, as he was fully entitled,

      to bestow the possession of their lands on his own favorites and

      retainers. Thus the authority of the sovereign gradually decayed; and each

      noble, fortified in his own territory by the attachment of his vassals,

      became too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne; and he

      secured by law what he had at first acquired by usurpation.

     

      During this precarious state of the supreme power, a difference would

      immediately be experienced between those portions of territory which were

      subjected to the feudal tenures, and those which were possessed by an

      allodial or free title. Though the latter possessions had at first been

      esteemed much preferable, they were soon found, by the progressive changes

      introduced into public and private law, to be of an inferior condition to

      the former. The possessors of a feudal territory, united by a regular

      subordination under one chief, and by the mutual attachments of the

      vassals, had the same advantages over the proprietors of the other, that a

      disciplined army enjoys over a dispersed multitude; and were enabled to

      commit with impunity all injuries on their defenceless neighbors Every

      one, therefore, hastened to seek that protection which he found so

      necessary; and each allodial proprietor, resigning his possessions into

      the hands of the king, or of some nobleman respected for power or valor,

      received them back with the condition of feudal services,[*] which, though

      a burden somewhat grievous, brought, him ample compensation, by connecting

      him with the neighboring proprietors, and placing him under the

      guardianship of a potent chieftain. The decay of the political government

      thus necessarily occasioned the extension of the feudal: the kingdoms of

      Europe were universally divided into baronies, and these into inferior

      fiefs; and the attachment of vassals to their chief, which was at first an

      essential part of the German manners, was still supported by the same

      causes from which it at first arose; the necessity of mutual protection,

      and the continued intercourse, between the head and the members, of

      benefits and services.

     

      But there was another circumstance, which corroborated these feudal

      dependencies, and tended to connect the vassals with their superior lord

      by an indissoluble bond of union. The northern conquerors, as well as the

      more early Greeks and Romans, embraced a policy, which is unavoidable to

      all nations that have made slender advances in refinement: they every

      where united the civil jurisdiction with the military power. Law, in its

      commencement, was not an intricate science, and was more governed by

      maxims of equity, which seem obvious to common sense, than by numerous and

      subtile principles, applied to a variety of cases by profound reasonings

      from analogy. An officer, though he had passed his life in the field, was

      able to determine all legal controversies which could occur within the

      district committed to his charge; and his decisions were the most likely

      to meet with a prompt and ready obedience, from men who respected his

      person, and were accustomed to act under his command. The profit arising

      from punishments, Which were then chiefly pecuniary, was another reason

      for his desiring to retain the judicial power; and when his fief became

      hereditary, this authority, which was essential to it, was also

      transmitted to his posterity. The counts and other magistrates, whose

      power was merely official, were tempted, in imitation of the feudal lords,

      whom they resembled in so many particulars, to render their dignity

      perpetual and hereditary; and in the decline of the regal power, they

      found no difficulty in making good their pretentions. After this manner

      the vast fabric of feudal subordination became quite solid and

      comprehensive; it formed every where an essential part of the political

      constitution; and the Norman and other barons, who followed the fortunes

      of William, were so accustomed to it, that they could scarcely form an

      idea of any other species of civil government.[*]

     

      The Saxons who conquered England, as they exterminated the ancient

      inhabitants, and thought themselves secured by the sea against new

      invaders, found it less requisite to maintain themselves in a military

      posture: the quantity of land which they annexed to offices seems to have

      been of small value; and for that reason continued the longer in its

      original situation, and was always possessed during pleasure by those who

      were intrusted with the command. These conditions were too precarious to

      satisfy the Norman barons, who enjoyed more independent possessions and

      jurisdictions in their own country; and William was obliged, in the new

      distribution of land, to copy the tenures which were now become universal

      on the continent. England of a sudden became a feudal kingdom,[**] and

      received all the advantages, and was exposed to all the inconveniences,

      incident to that species of civil polity.

     

      According to the principles of the feudal law, the king wa the supreme

      lord of the landed property: all possessors, who enjoyed the fruits or

      revenue of any part of it, held those privileges, either mediately or

      immediately, of him; and their property was conceived to be, in some

      degree, conditional.[***] The land was still apprehended to be a species

      of benefice, which was the original conception of a feudal property; and

      the vassal owed, in return for it, stated services to his baron, as the

      baron himself did for his land to the crown. The vassal was obliged to

      defend his baron in war; and the baron, at the head of his vassal, was

      bound to fight in defence of the king and kingdom. But besides these

      military services, which were casual, there were others imposed of a civil

      nature, which were more constant and durable.

     

      The northern nations had no idea that any man trained up to honor and

      inured to arms, was ever to be governed, without his own consent, by the

      absolute will of another; or that the administration of justice was ever

      to be exercised by the private opinion of any one magistrate, without the

      concurrence of some other persons, whose interest might induce them to

      check his arbitrary and iniquitous decisions. The king, therefore, when he

      found it necessary to demand any service of his barons or chief tenants,

      beyond what was due by their tenures, was obliged to assemble them, in

      order to obtain their consent; and when it was necessary to determine any

      controversy which might arise among the barons themselves, the question

      must be discussed in their presence, and be decided according to their

      opinion or advice. In these two circumstances of consent and advice,

      consisted chiefly the civil services of the ancient barons; and these

      implied all the considerable incidents of government. In one view, the

      barons regarded this attendance as their principal privilege; in another,

      as a grievous burden. That no momentous affairs could be transacted

      without their consent and advice, was in general esteemed the great

      security of their possessions and dignities; but as they reaped no

      immediate profit from their attendance at court, and were exposed to great

      inconvenience and charge by an absence from their own estates, every one

      was glad to exempt himself liom each particular exertion of this power;

      and was pleased both that the call for that duty should seldom return upon

      him, and that others should undergo the burden in his stead. The king, on

      the other hand, was usually anxious, for several reasons, that the

      assembly of the barons should be full at every stated or casual meeting:

      this attendance was the chief badge of their subordination to his crown,

      and drew them from that independence which they were apt to affect in

      their own castles and manors; and where the meeting was thin or ill

      attended, its determinations had less authority, and commanded not so

      ready an obedience from the whole community.

     

      The case was the same with the barons in their courts, as with the king in

      the supreme council of the nation. It was requisite to assemble the

      vassals, in order to determine by their vote any question which regarded

      the barony; and they sat along with the chief in all trials, whether civil

      or criminal, which occurred within the limits of their jurisdiction. They

      were; bound to pay suit and service at the court of their baron; and as

      their tenure was military, and consequently honorable, they were admitted

      into his society, and partook of his friendship. Thus, a kingdom was

      considered only as a great barony, and a barony as a small kingdom. The

      barons were peers to each other in the national council, and in some

      degree companions to the king; the vassals were peers to each other in the

      court of barony, and companions to their baron.[*]

     

      But though this resemblance so far took place, the vassals by the natural

      course of things, universally, in the feudal constitutions, fell into a

      greater subordination under the baron, than the baron himself under his

      sovereign; and these governments had a necessary and infallible tendency

      to augment the power of the nobles. The great chief, residing in his

      country seat, which he was commonly allowed to fortify, lost, in a great

      measure, his connection or acquaintance with the prince, and added every

      day new force to his authority over the vassals of the barony. They

      received from him education in all military exercises; his hospitality

      invited them to live and enjoy society in his hall; their leisure, which

      was great, made them perpetual retainers on his person, and partakers of

      his country sports and amusements; they had no means of gratifying their

      ambition but by making a figure in his train; his favor and countenance

      was their greatest honor; his displeasure exposed them to contempt and

      ignominy; and they felt every moment the necessity of his protection, both

      in the controversies which occurred with other vassals, and, what was more

      material, in the daily inroads and injuries which were committed by the

      neighboring barons. During the time of general war, the sovereign, who

      marched at the head of his armies, and was the great protector of the

      state, always acquired some accession to his authority, which he lost

      during the intervals of peace and tranquillity; but the loose police

      incident to the feudal constitutions, maintained a perpetual, though

      secret hostility, between the several members of the state; and the

      vassals found no means of securing themselves against the injuries to

      which they were continually exposed, but by closely adhering to their

      chief, and falling into a submissive dependence upon him.

     

      If the feudal government was so little favorable to the true liberty even

      of the military vassal, it was still more destructive of the independence

      and security of the other members of the state, or what in a proper sense

      we call the people. A great part of them were serfs, and lived in a state

      of absolute slavery or villainage; the other inhabitants of the country

      paid then rent in services, which were in a great measure arbitrary; and

      they could expect no redress of injuries in a court of barony from men who

      thought they had a right to oppress and tyrannize over them: the towns

      were situated either within the demesnes of the king, or the lands of the

      great barons, and were almost entirely subjected to the absolute will of

      their master. The languishing state of commerce kept the inhabitants poor

      and contemptible; and the political institutions were calculated to render

      that poverty perpetual. The barons and gentry, living in rustic plenty and

      hospitality, gave no encouragement to the arts, and had no demand for any

      of the more elaborate manufactures: every profession was held in contempt

      but that of arms; and if any merchant or manufacturer rose by industry and

      frugality to a degree of opulence, he found himself but the more exposed

      to injuries, from the envy and avidity of the military nobles.

     

      These concurring causes gave the feudal governments so strong a bias

      towards aristocracy, that the royal authority was extremely eclipsed in

      all the European states; and, instead of dreading the growth of

      monarchical power, we might rather expect, that the community would every

      where crumble into so many independent baronies, and lose the political

      union by which they were cemented. In elective monarchies, the event was

      commonly answerable to this expectation; and the barons, gaining ground on

      every vacancy of the throne, raised themselves almost to a state of

      sovereignty, and sacrificed to their power both the rights of the crown

      and the liberties of the people. But hereditary monarchies had a principle

      of authority which was not so easily subverted; and there were several

      causes which still maintained a degree of influence in the hands of the

      sovereign.

     

      The greatest baron could never lose view entirely of those principles of

      the feudal constitution which bound him, as, a vassal, to submission and

      fealty towards his prince; because he was every moment obliged to have

      recourse to those principles, in exacting fealty and submission from his

      own vassals The lesser barons, finding that the annihilation of royal

      authority left them exposed without protection to the insults and injuries

      of more potent neighbors, naturally adhered to the crown, and promoted the

      execution of general and equal laws. The people had still a stronger

      interest to desire the grandeur of the sovereign; and the king, being the

      legal magistrate, who suffered by every internal convulsion or oppression,

      and who regarded the great nobles as his immediate rivals, assumed the

      salutary office of general guardian or protector of the commons. Besides

      the prerogatives with which the law invested him, his large demesnes and

      numerous retainers rendered him, in one sense, the greatest baron in his

      kingdom; and where he was possessed of personal vigor and abilities, (for

      his situation required these advantages,) he was commonly able to preserve

      his authority, and maintain his station as head of the community, and the

      chief fountain of law and justice.

     

      The first kings of the Norman race were favored by another circumstance,

      which preserved them from the encroachments of their barons. They were

      generals of a conquering army, which was obliged to continue in a military

      posture, and to maintain great subordination under their leader, in order

      to secure themselves from the revolt of the numerous natives, whom they

      had bereaved of all their properties and privileges. But though this

      circumstance supported the authority of William and his immediate

      successors, and rendered them extremely absolute, it was lost as soon as

      the Norman barons began to incorporate with the nation, to acquire a

      security in their possessions, and to fix their influence over their

      vassals, tenants, and slaves. And the immense fortunes which the Conqueror

      had bestowed on his chief captains, served to support their independence,

      and make them formidable to the sovereign.

     

      He gave, for instance, to Hugh de Abrincis, his sister’s son, the whole

      county of Chester, which he erected into a palatinate, and rendered by his

      grant almost independent of the crown.[*] Robert, earl of Mortaigne, had

      nine hundred and seventy-three manors and lordships: Allan, earl of

      Brittany and Richmond, four hundred and forty-two: Odo, bishop of Baieux,

      four hundred and thirty-nine:[**] Geoffrey, bishop of Coutance, two

      hundred and eighty:[***] Walter Giffard, earl of Buckingham, one hundred

      and seven.

     

      William, earl Warrenne, two hundred and ninety-eight, besides twenty-eight

      towns or hamlets in Yorkshire: Todenei, eighty-one: Roger Bigod, one

      hundred and twenty-three: Robert, earl of Eu, one hundred and nineteen:

      Roger Mortimer, one hundred and thirty-two, besides several hamlets:

      Robert de Stafford, one hundred and thirty: Walter de Eurus, earl of

      Salisbury, forty-six Geoffrey de Mandeville, one hundred and eighteen

      Richard de Clare, one hundred and seventy-one: Hugh de Beauchamp,

      forty-seven: Baldwin de Rivers, one hundred and sixty-four: Henry de

      Ferrers, two hundred and twenty? two: William de Percy, one hundred and

      nineteen:[*] Norman d’Arcy, thirty-three.[**] Sir Henry Spelman computea

      that, in the large county of Norfolk, there were not, in the Conqueror’s

      time, above sixty-six proprietors of land.[***] Men possessed of such

      princely revenues and jurisdictions could not long be retained in the rank

      of subjects. The great Earl Warrenne, in a subsequent reign, when he was

      questioned concerning his right to the lands which he possessed, drew his

      sword, which he produced as his title; adding, that William the bastard

      did not conquer the kingdom himself; but that the barons, and his ancestor

      among me rest, were joint adventurers in the enterprise.[****]

     

      The supreme legislative power of England was lodged in the king and great

      council, or what was afterwards called the parliament. It is not doubted

      but the archbishops, bishops, and most considerable abbots were

      constituent members of this council. They sat by a double title: by

      prescription, as having always possessed that privilege, through the whole

      Saxon period, from the first establishment of Christianity; and by their

      right of baronage, as holding of the king in capite by military service.

      These two titles of the prelates were never accurately distinguished. When

      the usurpations of the church had risen to such a height, as to make the

      bishops affect a separate dominion, and regard their seat in parliament as

      a degradation of their episcopal dignity, the king insisted that they were

      barons, and, on that account, obliged, by the general principles of the

      feudal law, to attend on him in his great councils. Yet there still

      remained some practices, which supposed their title to be derived merely

      from ancient possession.

     

      The barons were another constituent part of the great council of the

      nation These held immediately of the crown by a military tenure: they were

      the most honorable members of the state, and had a right to be consulted

      in all public deliberations: they were the immediate vassals of the crown,

      and owed as a service their attendance in the court of their supreme lord.

      A resolution taken without their consent was likely to be but ill

      executed: and no determination of any cause or controversy among them had

      any validity, where the vote and advice of the body did not concur. The

      dignity of earl or count was official and territorial, as well as

      hereditary; and as ali the earls were also barons, they were considered as

      military vassals of the crown, were admitted in that capacity into the

      general council, and formed the most honorable and powerful branch of it.

     

      But there was another class of the immediate military tenants of the

      crown, no less, or probably more numerous than the barons, the tenants in

      capite by knights’ service and these, however inferior in power or

      property, held by a tenure which was equally honorable with that of the

      others. A barony was commonly composed of several knightsr fees: and

      though the number seems not to have been exactly defined, seldom consisted

      of less than fifty hides of land:[*] but where a man held of the king only

      one or two knight’s fees, he was still an immediate vassal of the crown,

      and as such had a title to have a seat in the general councils. But as

      this attendance was usually esteemed a burden, and one too great for a man

      of slender fortune to bear constantly, it is probable that, though he had

      a title, if he pleased, to be admitted, he was not obliged by any penalty,

      like the barons, to pay a regular attendance.

     

      All the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted not fully to

      seven hundred, when Domesday-book was framed; and as the membeirs were

      well pleased, on any pretext, to excuse themselves from attendance, the

      assembly was never likely to become too numerous for the despatch of

      public business.

     

      So far the nature of a general council or ancient parliament is determined

      without any doubt or controversy, The only question seems to be with

      regard to the commons, or the representatives of counties and boroughs;

      whether they were also, in more early times, constituent parts of

      parliament. This question was once disputed in England with great

      acrimony; but such is the force of time and evidence, that they can

      sometimes prevail even over faction; and the question seems, by general

      consent, and even by their own, to be at last determined against the

      ruling party. It is agreed, that the commons were no part of the great

      council till some ages after the conquest; and that the military tenants

      alone of the crown composed that supreme and legislative assembly.

     

      The vassals of a baron were by their tenure immediately dependent on him,

      owed attendance at his court, and paid all their duty to the king, through

      that dependence which their lord was obliged by his tenure to acknowledge

      to his sovereign and superior. Their land, comprehended in the barony, was

      represented in parliament by the baron himself, who was supposed,

      according to the fictions of the feudal law, to possess the direct

      property of it; and it would have been deemed incongruous to give it any

      other representation. They stood m the same capacity to him, that he and

      the other barons did to the king: the former were peers of the barony; the

      latter were peers of the realm: the vassals possessed a subordinate rank

      within their district: the baron enjoyed a superior dignity in the great

      assembly: they were in some degree his companions at home; he the king’s

      companion at court: and nothing can be more evidently repugnant to all

      feudal ideas, and to that gradual subordination which was essential to

      those ancient institutions, than to imagine that the king would apply

      either for the advice or consent of men who were of a rank so much

      inferior, and whose duty was immediately paid to the mesne lord that was

      interposed between them and the throne.[*]

     

      If it be unreasonable to think that the vassals of a barony, though their

      tenure was military, and noble, and honorable, were ever summoned to give

      their opinion in national councils, much less can it be supposed that the

      tradesmen or inhabitants of boroughs, whose condition was so much

      inferior, would be admitted to that privilege. It appears from Domesday,

      that the greatest boroughs were, at the time of the conquest, scarcely

      more than country villages; and that the inhabitants lived in entire

      dependence on the king or great lords, and were of a station little better

      than servile.[*] They were not then so much as incorporated; they formed

      no community; were not regarded as a body politic; and being really

      nothing but a number of low, dependent tradesmen, living, without any

      particular civil tie, in neighborhood together, they were incapable of

      being represented in the states of the kingdom. Even in France, a country

      which made more early advances in arts and civility than England, the

      first corporation is sixty years posterior to the conquest under the duke

      of Normandy; and the erecting of these communities was an invention of

      Lewis the Gross, in order to free the people from slavery under the lords,

      and to give them protection by means of certain privileges and a separate

      jurisdiction.[**] An ancient French writer calls them a new and wicked

      device, to procure liberty to slaves, and encourage them in shaking off

      the dominion of their masters.[***] The famous charter, as it is called,

      of the Conqueror to the city of London, though granted at a time when he

      assumed the appearance of gentleness and lenity, is nothing but a letter

      of protection, and a declaration that the citizens should not be treated

      as slaves.[****] By the English feudal law, the superior lord was

      prohibited from marrying his female ward to a burgess or a villain;[*****]

      so near were these two ranks esteemed to each other, and so much inferior

      to the nobility and gentry. Besides possessing the advantages of birth,

      riches, civil powers and privileges, the nobles and gentlemen alone were

      armed a circumstance which gave them a mighty superiority, in an age when

      nothing but the military profession was honorable, and when the loose

      execution of laws gave so much encouragement to open violence, and

      rendered it so decisive in all disputes and controversies.[*****]

     

      The great similarity among the feudal governments of Europe is well known

      to every man that has any acquaintance with ancient history: and the

      antiquaries of all foreign countries, where the question was never

      embarrassed by party disputes, have allowed that the commons came very

      late to be admitted to a share in the legislative power. In Normandy

      particularly, whose constitution was most likely to be William’s model in

      raising his new fabric of English government, the states were entirely

      composed of the clergy and nobility; and the first incorporated boroughs

      or communities of that duchy were Rouen and Falaise, which enjoyed their

      privileges by a grant of Philip Augustus in the year 1207.[**] All the

      ancient English historians, when they mention the great council of the

      nation, call it an assembly of the baronage, nobility, or great men; and

      none of their expressions, though several hundred passages might be

      produced, can, without the utmost violence, be tortured to a meaning which

      will admit the commons to be constituent members of that body.[***]

     

      If in the long period of two hundred years, which elapsed between the

      conquest and the latter end of Henry III., and which abounded in factions,

      revolutions, and convulsions of all kinds, the house of commons never

      performed one single legislative act so considerable as to be once

      mentioned by any of the numerous historians of that age, they must have

      been totally insignificant: and in that case, what reason can be assigned

      for their ever being assembled? Can it be supposed that men of so little

      weight or importance possessed a negative voice against the king and the

      barons? Every page of the subsequent histories discovers their existence;

      though these histories are not written with greater accuracy than the

      preceding ones, and indeed scarcely equal them in that particular. The

      Magna Charta of King John provides that no scutage or aid should be

      imposed, either on the land or towns, but by consent of the great council;

      and for more security it enumerates the persons entitled to a seat in that

      assembly, the prelates and immediate tenants of the crown, without any

      mention of the commons; an authority so full, certain, and explicit, that

      nothing but the zeal of party could ever have procured credit to any

      contrary hypothesis.

     

      It was probably the example of the French barons, which first imboldened

      the English to require greater independence from their sovereign: it is

      also probable that the boroughs and corporations of England were

      established in imitation of those of France. It may, therefore, be

      proposed as no unlikely conjecture, that both the chief privileges of the

      peers in England and the liberty of the commons were originally the growth

      of that foreign country.

     

      In ancient times, men were little solicitous to obtain a place in the

      legislative assemblies; and rather regarded their attendance as a burden,

      which was not compensated by any return of profit or honor, proportionate

      to the trouble and expense. The only reason for instituting those public

      councils was, on the part of the subject, that they desired some security

      from the attempts of arbitrary power; and on the part of the sovereign,

      that he despaired of governing men of such independent spirits without

      their own consent and concurrence. But the commons, or the inhabitants of

      boroughs, had not as yet reached such a degree of consideration, as to

      desire security against their prince, or to imagine that, even if they

      were assembled in a representative body, they had power or rank sufficient

      to enforce it. The only protection which they aspired to, was against the

      immediate violence and injustice of their fellow-citizens; and this

      advantage each of them looked for from the courts of justice, or from the

      authority of some great lord, to whom, by law or his own choice, he was

      attached. On the other hand, the sovereign was sufficiently assured of

      obedience in the whole community if he procured the concurrence of the

      nobles; nor had he reason to apprehend that any order of the state could

      resist his and their united authority. The military sub-vassals could

      entertain no idea of opposing both their prince and their superiors: the

      burgesses and tradesmen could much legs aspire to such a thought: and

      thus, even if history were silent on the head, we have reason to conclude,

      from the known situation of society during those ages, that the commons

      were never admitted as members of the legislative body.

     

      The executive power of the Anglo-Norman government was lodged in the king.

      Besides the stated meetings of the national council at the three great

      festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide,[*] he was accustomed, on

      any sudden exigence to summon them together. He could at his pleasure

      command the attendance of his barons and their vassals, in which consisted

      the military force of the kingdom; and could employ titem, during forty

      days, either in resisting a foreign enemy, or reducing his rebellious

      subjects. And what was of great importance, the whole judicial power was

      ultimately in his bands, and was exercised by officers and ministers of

      his appointment.

     

      The general plan of the Anglo-Norman government was, that the court of

      barony was appointed to decide such controversies as arose between the

      several vassals or subjects of the same barony: the hundred court and

      county court, which were still continued as during the Saxon times,[**] to

      judge between the subjects of different baronies;[***] and the curia

      regis, or king’s court, to give sentence among the barons

      themselves.[****]

     

      Circumstances which, being derived from a very extensive authority assumed

      by the conqueror, contributed to increase the royal prerogative; and, as

      long as the state was not disturbed by arms, reduced every order of the

      community to some degree of dependence and subordination.

     

      The king himself often sat in his court, which always attended his

      person:[**] he there heard causes and pronounced judgment;[***] and though

      he was assisted by the advice of the other members, it is not to be

      imagined that a decision could easily be obtained, contrary to his

      inclination or opinion. In his absence the chief justiciary presided, who

      was the first magistrate in the state, and a kind of viceroy, on whom

      depended all the civil affairs of the kingdom.[****] The other chief

      officers of the crown, the constable, mareschal, seneschal chamberlain,

      treasurer, and chancellor,[*****] were members, together with such feudal

      barons as thought proper to attend, and the barons of the exchequer, who

      at first were also feudal barons appointed by the king.[******] This

      court, which was sometimes called the king’s court, sometimes the court of

      exchequer, judged in all causes, civil and criminal, and comprehended the

      whole business which is now shared out among four courts the chancery, the

      king’s bench, the common pleas, and the exchequer.[*******]

     

      Such an accumulation of powers was itself a great source of authority, and

      rendered the jurisdiction of the court formidable to all the subjects; but

      the turn which judicial trials took soon after the conquest, served still

      more to increase its authority, and to augment the royal prerogatives.

      William, among the other violent changes which he attempted and effected,

      had introduced the Norman law into England,[********] had ordered all the

      pleadings to be in that tongue, and had interwoven with the English

      jurisprudence all the maxims and principles which the Normans, more

      advanced in cultivation and naturally litigious, were accustomed to

      observe in the distribution of justice.

     

      Law now became a science, which at first fell entirely into the hands of

      the Normans; and which, even after it was communicated to the English,

      required so much study and application, that the laity in those ignorant

      ages were incapable of attaining it, and it was a mystery almost solely

      confined to the clergy, and chiefly to the monks[*] The great officers of

      the crown, and the feudal barons, who were military men, found themselves

      unfit to penetrate into those obscurities; and though they were entitled

      to a seat in the supreme judicature, the business of the court was wholly

      managed by the chief justiciary and the law barons, who were men appointed

      by the king, and entirely at his disposal.[**] This natural course of

      things was forwarded by the multiplicity of business which flowed into

      that court, and which daily augmented by the appeals from all the

      subordinate judicatures of the kingdom.

     

      In the Saxon times, no appeal was received in the king’s court, except

      upon the denial or delay of justice by the inferior courts; and the same

      practice was still observed in most of the feudal kingdoms of Europe. But

      the great power of the Conqueror established at first in England an

      authority which the monarchs in France were not able to attain till the

      reign of St. Lewis, who lived near two centuries after: he empowered his

      court to receive appeals both from the courts of barony and the county

      courts, and by that means brought the administration of justice ultimately

      into the hands of the sovereign.[***] And, lest the expense or trouble of

      a journey to court should discourage suitors, and make them acquiesce in

      the decision of the inferior judicatures, itinerant judges were afterwards

      established, who made their circuits throughout the kingdom, and tried all

      causes that were brought before them.[****]

     

      By this expedient the courts of barony were kept in awe: and if they still

      preserved some influence, it was only from the apprehensions which the

      vassals might entertain of disobliging their superior, by appealing from

      his jurisdiction. But tha county courts were much discredited; and as the

      freeholders were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms of

      the new law, the lawyers gradually brought all business before the king’s

      judges, and abandoned the ancient simple and popular judicature. After

      this manner the formalities of justice, which, though they appear tedious

      and cumbersome, are found requisite to the support of liberty in all

      monarchical governments, proved at first, by a combination of causes, very

      advantageous to royal authority in England.

     

      The power of the Norman kings was also much supported by a great revenue;

      and by a revenue that was fixed, perpetual, and independent of the

      subject. The people, without betaking themselves to arms, had no check

      upon the king, and no regular security for the due administration of

      justice. In those days of violence, many instances of oppression passed

      unheeded; and soon after were openly pleaded as precedents, which it was

      unlawful to dispute or control. Princes and ministers were too ignorant to

      be themselves sensible of the advantages attending an equitable

      administration; and there was no established council or assembly which

      could protect the people, and, by withdrawing supplies, regularly and

      peaceably admonish the king of his duty, and insure the execution of the

      laws.

     

      The first branch of the king’s stated revenue was the royal demesnes, or

      crown lands, which were very extensive, and comprehended, beside a great

      number of manors, most of the chief cities of the kingdom. It was

      established by law, that the king could alienate no part of his demesne,

      and that he himself, or his successor, could at any time resume such

      donations:[*] but this law was never regularly observed; which happily

      rendered, in time, the crown somewhat more dependent.

     

      The rent of the crown-lands, considered merely as so much riches, was a

      source of power: the influence of the king over his tenants and the

      inhabitants of his towns increased this power: but the other numerous

      branches of his revenue, besides supplying his treasury, gave, by their

      very nature, a great latitude to arbitrary authority, and were a support

      of the prerogative; as will appear from an enumeration of them.

     

      The king was never content with the stated rents, but levied heavy

      talliages at pleasure on the inhabitants both of town and, country who

      lived within his demesne. All bargains of sale, in order to prevent theft,

      being prohibited, except in boroughs and public markets,[*] he pretended

      to exact tolls on all goods whist were there sold.[**] He seized two

      hogsheads, one before and one behind the mast, from every vessel that

      imported wine. All goods paid to his customs a proportional part of their

      value:[***] passage over bridges and on rivers was loaded with tolls at

      pleasure:[****] and though the boroughs by degrees bought the liberty of

      farming these impositions, yet the revenue profited by these bargains, new

      sums were often exacted for the renewal and confirmation of their

      Charters,[*****] and the people were thus held in perpetual dependence.

     

      Such was the situation of the inhabitants within the royal demesnes. But

      the possessors of land, or the military tenants, though they were better

      protected, both by law and by the great privilege of carrying arms, were,

      from the nature of their tenures, much exposed to the inroads of power,

      and possessed not what we should esteem in our age a very durable

      security. The Conqueror ordained that the barons should be obliged to pay

      nothing beyond their stated services,[******] except a reasonable aid to

      ransom his person if he were taken in war, to make his eldest son a

      knight, and to marry his eldest daughter. What should on these occasions

      be deemed a reasonable aid, was not determined; and the demands of the

      crown were so far discretionary.

     

      The king could require in war the personal attendance of his vassals, that

      is, of almost all the landed proprietors; and if they declined the

      service, they were obliged to pay him a composition in money, which was

      called a scutage. The sum was, during some reigns, precarious and

      uncertain; it was sometimes levied without allowing the vassal the liberty

      of personal service;[*******] and it was a usual artifice of the king’s to

      pretend an expedition, that he might be entitled to levy the scutage from

      his military tenants.

     

      Danegelt was another species of land-tax levied by the early Norman kings,

      arbitrarily, and contrary to the laws of the Conqueror.[*] Moneyage was

      also a general land-tax of the same nature, levied by the two first Norman

      kings, and abolished by the charter of Henry I.[**] It was a shilling paid

      every three years by each hearth, to induce the king not to use his

      prerogative in debasing the coin. Indeed, it appears from that charter,

      that though the Conqueror had granted his military tenants an immunity

      from all taxes and talliages, he and his son William had never thought

      themselves bound to observe that rule, but had levied impositions at

      pleasure on all the landed estates of the kingdom. The utmost that Henry

      grants is, that the land cultivated by the military tenant himself shall

      not be so burdened; but he reserves the power of taxing the farmers: and

      as it is known that Henry’s charter was never observed in any one article,

      we may be assured that this prince and his successors retracted even this

      small indulgence, and levied arbitrary impositions on all the lands of all

      their subjects. These taxes were sometimes very heavy; since Malmsbury

      tells us that, in the reign of William Rufus, the farmers, on account of

      them, abandoned tillage, and a famine ensued.[***]

     

      The escheats were a great branch both of power and of revenue, especially

      during the first reigns after the conquest. In default of posterity from

      the first baron, his land reverted to the crown, and continually augmented

      the king’s possessions. The prince had indeed by law a power of alienating

      these escheats; but by this means he had an opportunity of establishing

      the fortunes of his friends and servants, and thereby enlarging his

      authority. Sometimes he retained them in his own hands; and they were

      gradually confounded with the royal demesnes, and became difficult to be

      distinguished from them. This confusion is probably the reason why the

      king acquired the right of alienating his demesnes.

     

      But besides escheats from default of heirs, those which ensued from crimes

      or breach of duty towards the superior lord were frequent in ancient

      times. If the vassal, being thrice summoned to attend his superior’s

      court, and do fealty, neglected or refused obedience, he forfeited all

      title to his land.[*] If he denied his tenure, or refused his service, he

      was exposed to the same penalty.[**] If he sold his estate without license

      from his lord,[***] or if he sold it upon any other tenure or title than

      that by which he himself held it,[****] he lost all right to it. The

      adhering to his lord’s enemies,[*****] deserting him in war,[******]

      betraying his secrets,[*******] debauching his wife or his near

      relations,[********] or even using indecent freedoms with them,[*********]

      might be punished by forfeiture. The higher crimes, rapes, robbery,

      murder, arson, etc., were called felony; and being interpreted want of

      fidelity to his lord, made him lose his fief.[**********] Even where the

      felon was vassal to a baron, though his immediate lord enjoyed the

      forfeiture, the king might retain possession of his estate during a

      twelvemonth, and had the right of spoiling and destroying it, unless the

      baron paid him a reasonable composition.[***********] We have not here

      enumerated all the species of felonies, or of crimes by which forfeiture

      was incurred: we have said enough to prove that the possession of feudal

      property was anciently somewhat precarious, and that the primary idea was

      never lost, of its being a kind of fee or benefice.

     

      When a baron died, the king immediately took possession of the estate; and

      the heir, before he recovered his right, was obliged to make application

      to the crown, and desire that he might be admitted to do homage for his

      land, and pay a composition to the king. This composition was not at first

      fixed by law, at least by practice: the king was often exorbitant in his

      demands, and kept possession of the land till they were complied with.

     

      If the heir were a minor, the king retained the whole profit of the estate

      till his majority; and might grant what sum he thought proper for the

      education and maintenance of the young baron. This practice was also

      founded on the notion that a fief was a benefice, and that, while the heir

      could not perform his military services, the revenue devolved to the

      superior, who employed another in his stead. It is obvious that a great

      proportion of the landed property must, by means of this device, be

      continually in the hands of the prince, and that all the noble familius

      were thereby held in perpetual dependence. When the king granted the

      wardship of a rich heir to any one, he had the opportunity of enriching a

      favorite or minister: if he sold it, he thereby levied a considerable sum

      of money. Simon de Mountfort paid Henry III. ten thousand marks, an

      immense sum in those days, for the wardship of Gilbert de Umfreville.[*]

      Geoffrey de Mandeville paid to the same prince the sum of twenty thousand

      marks, that he might marry Isabel, countess of Glocester, and possess all

      her lands and knights’ fees. This sum would be equivalent to three hundred

      thousand, perhaps four hundred thousand pounds in our time.[**]

     

      If the heir were a female, the king was entitled to offer her any husband

      of her rank he thought proper; and if she refused him, she forfeited her

      land. Even a male heir could not marry without the royal consent; and it

      was usual for men to pay large sums for the liberty of making their own

      choice in marriage.[**] No man could dispose of his land, either by sale

      or will, without the consent of his superior. The possessor was never

      considered as full proprietor; he was still a kind of beneficiary; and

      could not oblige his superior to accept of any vassal that was not

      agreeable to him.

     

      Fines, amerciaments, and oblatas, as they were called, were another

      considerable branch of the royal power and revenue. The ancient records of

      the exchequer, which are still preserved, give surprising accounts of the

      numerous fines anc amerciaments levied in those days,[****] and of the

      strange inventions fallen upon to exact money from the subject.

     

      It appears that the ancient kings of England put themselves entirely on

      the footing of the barbarous Eastern princes, whom no man must approach

      without a present, who sell all their good offices, and who intrude

      themselves into every business, that they may have a pretence for

      extorting money. Even justice was avowedly bought and sold; the king’s

      court itself, though the supreme judicature of the kingdom, was open to

      none that brought not presents to the king; the bribes given for the

      expedition, delay,[*] suspension, and, doubtless, for the perversion of

      justice, were entered in the public registers of the royal revenue, and

      remain as monuments of the perpetual iniquity and tyranny of the times.

      The barons of the exchequer, for instance, the first nobility of the

      kingdom, were not ashamed to insert, as an article in their records, that

      the county of Norfolk paid a sum that they might be fairly dealt with;[**]

      the borough of Yarmouth, that the king’s charters, which they have for

      their liberties, might not be violated;[***] Richard, son of Gilbert, for

      the king’s helping him to recover his debt from the Jews;[****] Serlo, son

      of Terlavaston, that he might be permitted to make his defence, in case he

      were accused of a certain homicide;[*****] Waiter de Burton, for free law,

      if accused of wounding another;[******] Robert de Essart, for having an

      Liquest to find whether Roger the butcher, and Wace and Humphrey, accused

      him of robbery and theft out of envy and ill will, or not;[*******]

      William Buhurst, for having an inquest to find whether he were accused of

      the death of one Goodwin out of ill will, or for just cause.[********] I

      have selected these few instances from a great number of a like kind,

      which Madox had selected from a still greater number, preserved in the

      ancient rolls of the exchequer.[*********]

     

      Sometimes the party litigant offered the king a certain portion, a half, a

      third, a fourth, payable out of the debts which he, as the executor of

      justice, should assist him in recovering.[**********] Theophania de

      Westland agreed to pay the half of two hundred and twelve marks, that she

      might recover that sum against James de Fughleston;[*] Solomon the Jew

      engaged to pay one mark out of every seven that he should recover against

      Hugh dÃ¨ la Hose;[************] Nicholas Morrel promised to pay sixty

      pounds, that the earl of Flanders might be distrained to pay him three

      hundred and forty-three pounds, which the earl had taken from him; and

      these sixty pounds were to be paid out of the first money that Nicholas

      should recover from the earl.[*************]

     

      As the king assumed the entire power over trade, he was to be paid for a

      permission to exercise commerce or industry of any kind.[**] Hugh Oisel

      paid four hundred marks for liberty to trade in England:[***] Nigel de

      Havene gave fifty marks for the partnership in merchandise which he had

      with Gervase de Hanton:[****] the men of Worcester paid one hundred

      shillings, that they might have the liberty of selling and buying dyed

      cloth, as formerly;[*****] several other towns paid for a like

      liberty.[******] The commerce indeed of the kingdom was so much under the

      control of the king, that he erected guilds, corporations, and monopolies

      wherever he pleased; and levied sums for these exclusive

      privileges.[*******]

     

      There were no profits so small as to be below the king’s attention. Henry,

      son of Arthur, gave ten dogs, to have a recognition against the countess

      of Copland for one knight’s fee.[********] Roger, son of Nicholas, gave

      twenty lampreys and twenty shads for an inquest to find whether Gilbert,

      son of Alured, gave to Roger two hundred muttons to obtain his

      confirmation for certain lands, or whether Roger took them from him by

      violence;[*********] Geoffrey Fitz-Pierre, the chief justiciary, gave two

      good Norway hawks, that Walter le Madine might have leave to export a

      hundred weight of cheese out ot the king’s dominions.[**********]

     

      It is really amusing to remark the strange business in which the king

      sometimes interfered, and never without a present; the wife of Hugh de

      Nevile gave the king two hundred hens, that she might lie with her husband

      one night;[***********] and she brought with her two sureties, who

      answered each for a hundred hens.

     

      It is probable that her husband was a prisoner, which debarred her from

      having access to him. The abbot of Rucford paid ten marks for leave to

      erect houses and place men upon his land near Welhang, in order to secure

      his wood there from being stolen; Hugh, archdeacon of Wells, gave one tun

      of wine for leave to carry six hundred summs of corn whither he would;

      Peter de Perariis gave twenty marks for leave to salt fishes as Peter

      Chevalier used to do.

     

      It was usual to pay high fines, in order to gain the king’s good will or

      mitigate his anger. In the reign of Henry II., Gilbert, the son of Fergus,

      fines in nine hundred and nineteen pounds nine shillings, to obtain that

      prince’s favor; William de Chataignes, a thousand marks, that he would

      remit his displeasure. In the reign of Henry III., the city of London

      fines in no less a sum than twenty thousand pounds on the same account.

     

      The king’s protection and good offices of every kind were bought and sold.

      Robert Grislet paid twenty marks of silver, that the king would help him

      against the earl of Mortaigne in a certain plea: Robert de Cundet gave

      thirty marks of silver, that the king would bring him to an accord with

      the bishop of Lincoln; Ralph de BrÃ©ckham gave a hawk, that the king would

      protect him; and this is a very frequent reason for payments; John, son of

      Ordgar, gave a Norway hawk, to have the king’s request to the king of

      Norway to let him have his brother Godard’s chattels; Richard de Neville

      gave twenty palfreys to obtain the king’s request to Isolda Bisset, that

      she should take him for a husband; Roger Fitz-Walter gave three good

      palfreys to have the king’s letter to Roger Bertram’s mother, that she

      should marry him; Eling the dean paid one hundred marks, that his whore

      and his children might be let out upon bail; the bishop of Winchester gave

      one tun of good wine for his not putting the king in mind to give a girdle

      to the countess of Albemarle; Robert de Veaux gave five of the best

      palfreys, that the king would hold his tongue about Henry Pinel’s wife.

      There are in the records of exchequer many other singular instances of a

      like nature.[*] It will, however, be just to remark, that the same

      ridiculous practices and dangerous abuses prevailed in Normandy, and

      probably in all the other states of Europe.[**] England was not in this

      respect more barbarous than its neighbors.

     

      These iniquitous practices of the Norman kings were so well known, that,

      on the death of Hugh Bigod, in the reign of Henry II., the best and most

      just of these princes, the eldest son and the widow of this nobleman came

      to court, and strove, by offering large presents to the king, each of them

      to acquire possession of that rich inheritance. The king was so equitable

      as to order the cause to be tried by the great council! But, in the mean

      time, he seized all the money and treasure of the deceased,[***] Peter, of

      Blois, a judicious, and even an elegant writer, for that age, gives a

      pathetic description of the reign of Henry; and he scruples not to

      complain to the king himself of these abuses.[****]

     

      We may judge what the case would be under the government of worse princes.

      The articles of inquiry concerning the conduct of sheriffs, which Henry

      promulgated in 1170, show the great power as well as the licentiousness of

      these officers.[**]

     

      Amerciaments or fines for crimes and trespasses were an ether considerable

      branch of the royal revenue.[***] Most crimes were atoned for by money;

      the fines imposed were not limited by any rule or statute; and frequently

      occasioned the total ruin of the person, even for the slightest

      trespasses. The forest laws, particularly, were a great source of

      oppression The king possessed sixty-eight forests, thirteen chases, and

      seven hundred and eighty-one parks, in different parts of England;[****]

      and, considering the extreme passion of the English and Normans for

      hunting, these were so many snares laid for the people, by which they were

      allured into trespasses and brought within the reach of arbitrary and

      rigorous laws, which the king had thought proper to enact by his own

      authority.

     

      But the most barefaced acts of tyranny and oppression were practised

      against the Jews, who were entirely out of the protection of law, were

      extremely odious from the bigotry of the people, and were abandoned to the

      immeasurable rapacity of the king and his ministers. Besides many other

      indignities to which they were continually exposed, it appears that they

      were once all thrown into prison, and the sum of sixty-six thousand marks

      exacted for their liberty:[*****] at another time, Isaac the Jew paid,

      alone, five thousand one hundred marks[******] Brim, three thousand

      marks;[*******] Jurnet, two thousand; Bennet, five hundred: at another,

      Licorica, widow of David the Jew, of Oxford, was required to pay six

      thousand marks; and she was delivered over to six of the richest and

      discreetest Jews in England, who were to answer for the sum.[********]

     

      Henry III borrowed five thousand marks from the earl of Cornwall; and for

      his repayment consigned over to him all the Jews in England. The revenue

      arising from exactions upon this nation was so considerable, that there

      was a particular court of exchequer set apart for managing it.

     

      We may judge concerning the low state of commerce among the English, when

      the Jews, notwithstanding these oppressions, could still find their

      account in trading among them, and lending them money. And as the

      improvements of agriculture were also much checked by the immense

      possessions of the nobility, by the disorders of the times, and by the

      precarious state of feudal property, it appears that industry of no kind

      could then have place in the kingdom.

     

      It is asserted by Sir Harry Spelman,[*] as an undoubted truth, that,

      during the reigns of the first Norman princes, every edict of the king,

      issued with the consent of his privy council, had the full force of law.

      But the barons surely were not so passive as to intrust a power, entirely

      arbitrary and despotic, into the hands of the sovereign. It only appears,

      that the constitution had not fixed any precise boundaries to the royal

      power; that the right of issuing proclamations on any emergence, and of

      exacting obedience to them,—a right which was always supposed

      inherent in the crown,—is very difficult to be distinguished from a

      legislative authority; that the extreme imperfection of the ancient laws,

      and the sudden exigencies which often occurred in such turbulent

      governments, obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent powers of

      his prerogative; that he naturally proceeded, from the acquiescence of the

      people, to assume, in many particulars of moment, an authority from which

      he had excluded himself by express statutes, charters, or concessions, and

      which was, in the main, repugnant to the general genius of the

      constitution; and that the lives; the personal liberty, and the properties

      of all his subjects were less secured by law against the exertion of his

      arbitrary authority than by the independent power and private connections

      of each individual.

     

      It appears from the Great Charter itself, that not only John, a tyrannical

      prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father, Henry, under whose

      reign the prevalence of gross abuses is the least to be suspected, were

      accustomed, from their sole authority, without process of law, to

      imprison, banish, and attaint the freemen of their kingdom.

     

      A great baron, in ancient times, considered himself as a kind of sovereign

      within his territory; and was attended by courtiers and dependants more

      zealously attached to him than the ministers of state and the great

      officers were commonly o their sovereign. He often maintained in his court

      the parade of royalty, by establishing a justiciary, constable, mareschal,

      chamberlain, seneschal, and chancellor, and assigning to each of these

      officers a separate province and command He was usually very assiduous in

      exercising his jurisdiction, and took such delight in that image of

      sovereignty, that it was found necessary to restrain his activity, and

      prohibit him by law from holding courts too frequently.[*] It is not to be

      doubted but the example set him by the prince, of a mercenary and sordid

      extortion, would be faithfully copied; and that all his good and bad

      offices, his justice and injustice, were equally put to sale. He had the

      power, with the king’s consent, to exact talliages even from the free

      citizens who lived within his barony; and as his necessities made him

      rapacious, his authority was usually found to be more oppressive and

      tyrannical than that of the sovereign.[**] He was ever engaged in

      hereditary or personal animosities or confederacies with his neighbors,

      and often gave protection to all desperate adventurers and criminals, who

      could be useful in serving his violent purposes. He was able alone, in

      times of tranquillity, to obstruct the execution of justice within his

      territories; and by combining with a few malecontent barons of high rank

      and power, he could throw the state into convulsions. And, on the whole,

      though the royal authority was confined within bounds, and often within

      very narrow ones, yet the check was Irregular, and frequently the source

      of great disorders; nor was it derived from the liberty of the people, but

      from the military power of many petty tyrants, who were equally dangerous

      to the prince and oppressive to the subject.

     

      The power of the church was another rampart against royal authority; but

      this defence was also the cause of many mischiefs and inconveniencies. The

      dignified clergy, perhaps, were not so prone to immediate violence as the

      barons; but as they pretended to a total independence on the state, and

      could always cover themselves with the appearances of religion, they

      proved, in one respect, an obstruction to the settlement of the kingdom,

      and to the regular execution of the laws. The policy of the Conqueror was

      in this particular liable to some exception. He augmented the

      superstitious veneration for Rome, to which that age was so much inclined,

      and he broke those bands of connection which, in the Saxon times, had

      preserved a union between the lay and the clerical orders. He prohibited

      the bishops from sitting in the county courts; he allowed ecclesiastical

      causes to be tried in spiritual courts only;[**] and he so much exalted

      the power of the clergy, that of sixty thousand two hundred and fifteen

      knights’ fees, into which he divided England, he placed no less than

      twenty-eight thousand and fifteen under the church.[**]

     

      The right of primogeniture was introduced with the feudal law; an

      institution which is hurtful by producing and maintaining an unequal

      division of private propeny; but is advantageous in another respect, by

      accustoming the people to a preference in favor of the eldest son, and

      thereby preventing a partition or disputed succession in the monarchy. The

      Normans introduced the use of surnames, which tend to preserve the

      knowledge of families and pedigrees. They abolished none of the old,

      absurd methods of trial by the cross or ordeal; and they added a new

      absurdity—the trial by single combat—[***] which became a

      regular part of jurisprudence, and was conducted with all the order,

      method, devotion, and solemnity imaginable.[****] The ideas of chivalry

      also seem to have been imported by the Normans: no traces of those

      fantastic notions are to be found among the plain and rustic Saxons.

     

      The feudal institutions, by raising the military tenants to a kind of

      sovereign dignity, by rendering personal strength and valor requisite, and

      by making every knight and baron his own protector and avenger, begat that

      martial pride and sense of honor which, being cultivated and embellished

      by the poets and romance writers of the age, ended in chivalry. The

      virtuous knight fought not only in his own quarrel, but in that of the

      innocent, of the helpless, and, above all, of the fair, whom he supposed

      to be forever under the guardianship of his valiant arm. The uncourteous

      knight who, from his castle, exercised robbery on travellers, and

      committed violence on virgins, was the object of his perpetual

      indignation; and he put him to death, without scruple, or trial, or

      appeal, wherever he met with him. The great independence of men made

      personal honor and fidelity the chief tie among them, and rendered it the

      capital virtue of every true knight, or genuine professor of chivalry. The

      solemnities of single combat, as established by law, banished the notion

      of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters, and maintained an

      appearance of courtesy between the combatants till the moment of their

      engagement. The credulity of the age grafted on this stock the notion of

      giants, enchanters, dragons, spells,[*] and a thousand wonders, which

      still multiplied during the times of the crusades; when men, returning

      from so great a distance, used the liberty of imposing every fiction on

      their believing audience. These ideas of chivalry infected the writings,

      conversation, and behavior of men, during some ages; and even after they

      were, in a great measure, banished by the revival of learning, they left

      modern gallantry and the point of honor, which still maintain their

      influence, and are the genuine off-spring of those ancient affectations.

     

      The concession of the Great Charter, or rather its full establishment,

      (for there was a considerable interval of time between the one and the

      other,) gave rise, by degrees, to a new species of government, and

      introduced some order and justice into the administration. The ensuing

      scenes of our history are therefore somewhat different from the preceding.

      Yet the Great Charter contained no establishment of new courts

      magistrates, or senates, nor abolition of the old. It introduced no new

      distribution of the powers of the common-wealth, and no innovation in the

      political or public law of the kingdom. It only guarded, and that merely

      by verbal clauses, against such tyrannical practices as are incompatible

      with civilized government, and, if they become very frequent, are

      incompatible with all government. The barbarous license of the kings, and

      perhaps of the nobles, was thenceforth somewhat more restrained: men

      acquired some more security for their properties and their liberties; and

      government approached a little nearer to that end for which it was

      originally instituted—the distribution of justice, and the equal

      protection of the citizens. Acts of violence and iniquity in the crown,

      which before were only deemed injurious to individuals, and were hazardous

      chiefly in proportion to the number, power, and dignity of the persons

      affected by them, were now regarded, in some degree, as public injuries,

      and as infringements of a charter calculated for general security. And

      thus the establishment of the Great Charter, without seeming anywise to

      innovate in the distribution of political power, became a kind of epoch in

      the constitution
