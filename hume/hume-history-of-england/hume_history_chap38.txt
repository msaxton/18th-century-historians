In a nation so divided as the English, it could scarcely be expected that

the death of one sovereign, and the accession of another, who was

generally believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which

prevailed, could be the object of universal satisfaction: yet so much were

men displeased with the present conduct of affairs, and such apprehensions

were entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking their

theological disputes, expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the

sceptre had passed into the hand of Elizabeth. That princess had

discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister;

and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every

moment exposed, compassion towards her situation, and concern for her

safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favorite of the

nation. A parliament had been assembled a few days before Mary’s death;

and when Heathe, archbishop of York, then chancellor, notified to them

that event, scarcely an interval of regret appeared; and the two houses

immediately resounded with the joyful acclamations of “God save Queen

Elizabeth: long and happily may she reign.” The people, less actuated by

faction, and less influenced by private views, expressed a joy still more

general and hearty on her proclamation; and the auspicious commencement of

this reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which, during its whole

course, so uniformly attended it.[*]

 

Elizabeth was at Hatfield when she heard of her sister’s death; and after

a few days she went thence to London, through crowds of people, who strove

with each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their affection.

On her entrance into the Tower, she could not forbear reflecting on the

great difference between her present fortune and that which a few years

before had attended her, when she was conducted to that place as a

prisoner, and lay there exposed to all the bigoted malignity of her

enemies. She fell on her knees, and expressed her thanks to Heaven for the

deliverance which the Almighty had granted her from her bloody

persecutors; a deliverance, she said, no less miraculous than that which

Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of pious gratitude

seems to have been the last circumstance in which she remembered any past

hardships and injuries. With a prudence and magnanimity truly laudable,

she buried all offences in oblivion, and received with affability even

those who had acted with the greatest malevolence against her. Sir Henry

Benningfield himself, to whose custody she had been committed, and who had

treated her with severity, never felt, during the whole course of her

reign, any effects of her resentment.[**] Yet was not the gracious

reception which she gave, prostitute and undistinguishing. When the

bishops came in a body to make their obeisance to her, she expressed to

all of them sentiments of regard; except to Bonner, from whom she turned

aside, as from a man polluted with blood, who was a just object of horror

to every heart susceptible of humanity.[***]

 

After employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs, Elizabeth

notified to foreign courts her sister’s death, and her own accession. She

sent Lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where Philip then resided; and she

took care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the protection

which he had afforded her, and her desire of persevering in that

friendship which had so happily commenced between them. Philip, who had

long foreseen this event, and who still hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to

obtain that dominion over England, of which he had failed in espousing

Mary, immediately despatched orders to the duke of Feria, his ambassador

at London, to make proposals of marriage to the queen; and he offered to

procure from Rome a dispensation for that purpose. But Elizabeth soon came

to the resolution of declining the proposal. She saw that the nation had

entertained an extreme aversion to the Spanish alliance during her

sister’s reign; and that one great cause of the popularity which she

herself enjoyed, was the prospect of being freed by her means from the

danger of foreign subjection. She was sensible that her affinity with

Philip was exactly similar to that of her father with Catharine of

Arragon; and that her marrying that monarch was, in effect, declaring

herself illegitimate, and incapable of succeeding to the throne. And

though the power of the Spanish monarchy might still be sufficient, in

opposition to all pretenders, to support her title, her masculine spirit

disdained such precarious dominion, which, as it would depend solely on

the power of another, must be exercised according to his inclinations.[*]

But while these views prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a

marriage with Philip, she gave him an obliging, though evasive answer; and

he still retained such hopes of success, that he sent a messenger to Rome,

with orders to solicit the dispensation.

 

The queen too, on her sister’s death, had written to Sir Edward Carne, the

English ambassador at Rome, to notify her accession to the pope; but the

precipitate nature of Paul broke through all the cautious measures

concerted by this young princess. He told Carne, that England was a fief

of the holy see; and it was great temerity in Elizabeth to have assumed,

without his participation, the title and authority of queen: that being

illegitimate, she could not possibly inherit that kingdom; nor could he

annul the sentence, pronounced by Clement VII. and Paul III., with regard

to Henry’s marriage: that were he to proceed with rigor, he should punish

this criminal invasion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications

but being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence, he would still

keep the door of grace open to her, and that if she would renounce all

pretensions to the crown, and submit entirely to his will, she should

experience the utmost lenity compatible with the dignity of the apostolic

see.[*] When this answer was reported to Elizabeth, she was astonished at

the character of that aged pontiff; and having recalled her ambassador,

she continued with more determined resolution to pursue those measures

which already she had secretly embraced.

 

The queen, not to alarm the partisans of the Catholic religion, had

retained eleven of her sister’s counsellors; but in order to balance their

authority, she added eight more, who were known to be inclined to the

Protestant communion: the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Bedford, Sir

Thomas Parry, Sir Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir Francis Knolles,

Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and Sir William Cecil,

secretary of state.[**]

 

With these counsellors, particularly Cecil, she frequently deliberated

concerning the expediency of restoring the Protestant religion, and the

means of executing that great enterprise. Cecil told her, that the greater

part of the nation had, ever since her father’s reign, inclined to the

reformation, and though her sister had constrained them to profess the

ancient faith, the cruelties exercised by her ministers had still more

alienated their affections from it: that happily the interests of the

sovereign here concurred with the inclinations of the people; nor was her

title to the crown compatible with the authority of the Roman pontiff:

that a sentence, so solemnly pronounced by two popes against her mother’s

marriage, could not possibly be recalled without inflicting a mortal wound

on the credit of the see of Rome; and even if she were allowed to retain

the crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependent footing: that

this circumstance alone counterbalanced all dangers whatsoever; and these

dangers themselves, if narrowly examined, would be found very little

formidable: that the curses and execrations of the Romish church, when not

seconded by military force, were, in the present age, more an object of

ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as

in the next: that though the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might

incline them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her, their

interests were so incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan

of operations; and the enmity of the one would always insure to her the

friendship of the other: that if they encouraged the discontents of her

Catholic subjects, their dominions also abounded with Protestants, and it

would be easy to retaliate upon them: that even such of the English as

seemed at present zealously attached to the Catholic faith, would, most of

them, embrace the religion of their new sovereign; and the nation had of

late been so much accustomed to these revolutions, that men had lost all

idea of truth and falsehood in such subjects: that the authority of Henry

VIII., so highly raised by many concurring circumstances, first inured the

people to this submissive deference; and it was the less difficult for

succeeding princes to continue the nation in a track to which it had so

long been accustomed; and that it would be easy for her, by bestowing on

Protestants all preferment in civil offices and the militia, the church

and the universities, both to insure her own authority, and to render her

religion entirely predominant.[*]

 

The education of Elizabeth, as well as her interest, led her to favor the

reformation; and she remained not long in suspense with regard to the

party which she should embrace. But though determined in her own mind, she

resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps, and not to imitate the

example of Mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to make immediately

a violent invasion on the established religion.[**] She thought it

requisite, however, to discover such symptoms of her intentions as might

give encouragement to the Protestants so much depressed by the late

violent persecutions. She immediately recalled all the exiles, and gave

liberty to the prisoners who were confined on account of religion. We are

told of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on this occasion, who said to the

queen, that he had a petition to present her in behalf of other prisoners

called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: she readily replied, that it behoved

her first to consult the prisoners themselves, and to learn of them

whether they desired that liberty which he demanded for them.[***]

 

Elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts of

power which were authorized by the extent of royal prerogative during that

age. Finding that the Protestant teachers, irritated by persecution, broke

out in a furious attack on the ancient superstition, and that the

Romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony, she published a

proclamation, by which she inhibited all preaching without a special

license;[*] and though she dispensed with these orders in favor of some

preachers of her own sect, she took care that they should be the most calm

and moderate of the party. She also suspended the laws so far as to order

a great part of the service; the litany, the Lord’s prayer, the creed, and

the gospels; to be read in English. And having first published

injunctions, that all the churches should conform themselves to the

practice of her own chapel, she forbade the host to be any more elevated

in her presence; an innovation which, however frivolous it may appear,

implied the most material consequences.[**]

 

These declarations of her intention, concurring with preceding suspicions,

made the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in religion. They

therefore refused to officiate at her coronation; and it was with some

difficulty that the bishop of Carlisle was at last prevailed on to perform

the ceremony. When she was conducted through London, amidst the joyful

acclamations of her subjects, a boy, who personated truth, was let down

from one of the triumphal arches, and presented to her a copy of the

Bible. She received the book with the most gracious deportment; placed it

next her bosom; and declared that, amidst all the costly testimonies which

the city had that day given her of their attachment, this present was by

far the most precious and most acceptable.[*] Such were the innocent

artifices by which Elizabeth insinuated herself into the affections of her

subjects. Open in her address, gracious and affable in all public

appearances, she rejoiced in the concourse of her subjects, entered into

all their pleasures and amusements; and without departing from her

dignity, which she knew well how to preserve, she acquired a popularity

beyond what any of her predecessors or successors ever could attain. Her

own sex exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence

and fortitude: and while a young princess of twenty-five years, (for that

was her age at her accession,) who possessed all the graces and

insinuation, though not all the beauty of her sex, courted the affections

of individuals by her civilities, of the public by her services; her

authority though corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion,

appeared to be derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the

people.

 

A sovereign of this disposition was not likely to offend her subjects by

any useless or violent exertions of power; and Elizabeth, though she threw

out such hints as encouraged the Protestants delayed the entire change of

religion till the meeting of the parliament, which was summoned to

assemble. The elections had gone entirely against the Catholics, who seem

not indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority;[*] and the

houses met in a disposition of gratifying the queen in every particular

which she could desire of them. They began the session with a unanimous

declaration, “that Queen Elizabeth was, and ought to be, as well by the

word of God, as the common and statute laws of the realm, the lawful,

undoubted, and true heir to the crown, lawfully descended from the blood

royal, according to the order of succession settled in the thirty-fifth of

Henry VIII.”[**]

 

This act of recognition was probably dictated by the queen herself and her

ministers; and she showed her magnanimity, as well as moderation, in the

terms which she employed on that occasion. She followed not Mary’s

practice in declaring the validity of her mother’s marriage, or in

expressly repealing the act formerly made against her own legitimacy: she

knew that this attempt must be attended with reflections on her father’s

memory, and on the birth of her deceased sister; and as all the world was

sensible, that Henry’s divorce from Anne Boleyn was merely the effect of

his usual violence and caprice, she scorned to found her title on any act

of an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority by its former

variable, servile, and iniquitous decisions. Satisfied, therefore, in the

general opinion entertained with regard to this fact, which appeared the

more undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered in fortifying it by votes

and inquiries; she took possession of the throne both as her birthright,

and as insured to her by former acts of parliament; and she never appeared

anxious to distinguish these titles.[*]

 

The first bill brought into parliament with a view of trying their

disposition on the head of religion, was that for suppressing the

monasteries lately erected, and for restoring the tenths and first-fruits

to the queen. This point being gained without much difficulty, a bill was

next introduced, annexing the supremacy to the crown; and though the queen

was there denominated “governess,” not “head,” of the church, it conveyed

the same extensive power which under the latter title had been exercised

by her father and brother. All the bishops who were present in the upper

house strenuously opposed this law; and as they possessed more learning

than the temporal peers, they triumphed in the debate; but the majority of

voices in that house, as well as among the commons, was against them. By

this act, the crown, without the concurrence either of the parliament, or

even of the convocation, was vested with the whole spiritual power; might

repress all heresies, might establish or repeal all canons, might alter

every point of discipline, and might ordain or abolish any religious rite

or ceremony,[**]

 

In determining heresy, the sovereign was only limited (if that could be

called a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by the

authority of the Scripture, by the first four general councils, or by any

general council which followed the Scripture as their rule, or to such

other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the

parliament and convocation. In order to exercise this authority, the

queen, by a clause of the act, was empowered to name commissioners, either

laymen or clergymen, as she should think proper; and on this clause was

afterwards founded the court of ecclesiastical commission; which assumed

large discretionary, not to say arbitrary powers, totally incompatible

with any exact boundaries in the constitution. Their proceedings, indeed,

were only consistent with absolute monarchy; but were entirely suitable to

the genius of the act on which they were established; an act that at once

gave the crown alone all the power which had formerly been claimed by the

popes, but which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to

exercise without some concurrence of the national clergy.

 

Whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queen’s supremacy, was

incapacitated from holding any office; whoever denied the supremacy, or

attempted to deprive the queen of that prerogative, forfeited, for the

first offence, all his goods and chattels; for the second, was subjected

to the penalty of a prÃ¦munire; but the third offence was declared treason.

These punishments, however severe, were less rigorous than those which

were formerly, during the reigns of her father and brother, inflicted in

like cases.

 

A law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in King Edward’s time

with regard to religion:[*] the nomination of bishops was given to the

crown, without any election of the chapters: the queen was empowered, on

the vacancy of any see, to seize all the temporalities, and to bestow on

the bishop elect an equivalent in the impropriations belonging to the

crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly much inferior in value; and

thus the queen, amidst all her concern for religion, followed the example

of the preceding reformers in committing depredations on the

ecclesiastical revenues.

 

The bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their

revenues, and from letting leases longer than twenty-one years or three

lives. This law seemed to be meant for securing the property of the

church; but as an exception was left in favor of the crown, great abuses

still prevailed. It was usual for the courtiers, during this reign, to

make an agreement with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a fictitious

alienation to the queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the

person agreed on.[**] This method of pillaging the church was not remedied

till the beginning of James I. The present depression of the clergy

exposed them to all injuries; and the laity never stopped till they had

reduced the church to such poverty, that her plunder was no longer a

compensation for the odium incurred by it.

 

A solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence

of Lord Keeper Bacon, between the divines of the Protestant and those of

the Catholic communion. The champions appointed to defend the religion of

the sovereign were, as in all former instances, entirely triumphant; and

the Popish disputants, being pronounced refractory and obstinate, were

even punished by imprisonment.[***]

 

Emboldened by this victory, the Protestants ventured on the last and most

important step, and brought into parliament a bill[*] for abolishing the

mass and reestablishing the liturgy of King Edward. Penalties were

enacted, as well against those who departed from this mode of worship, as

against those who absented themselves from the church and the sacraments.

And thus in one session, without any violence, tumult, or clamor, was the

whole system of religion altered, on the very commencement of a reign, and

by the will of a young woman, whose title to the crown was by many thought

liable to objections; an event which, though it may appear surprising to

men in the present age, was every where expected on the first intelligence

of Elizabeth’s accession.

 

The commons also made a sacrifice to the queen, more difficult to obtain

than that of any articles of faith: they voted a subsidy of four shillings

in the pound on land, and two shillings and eightpence on movables,

together with two fifteenths.[**] 1 The house in no instance

departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the

queen. Even the importune address which they made her on the conclusion of

the session, to fix her choice of a husband, could not, they supposed, be

very disagreeable to one of her sex and age. The address was couched in

the most respectful expressions, yet met with a refusal from the queen.

 

1559.

 

She told the speaker, that, as the application from the house was

conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without pretending

to direct her choice of a husband, she could not take offence at the

address, or regard it otherwise than as a new instance of their

affectionate attachment to her: that any further interposition on their

part, would have ill become either them to make as subjects, or her to

bear as an independent princess: that even while she was a private person,

and exposed to much danger, she had always declined that engagement, which

she regarded as an encumbrance; much more, at present, would she persevere

in this sentiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was committed to

her, and her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the interests

of religion and the happiness of her subjects: that as England was her

husband, wedded to her by this pledge, (and here she showed her finger

with the same gold ring upon it with which she had solemnly betrothed

herself to the kingdom at her inauguration,) so all Englishmen were her

children, and while she was employed in rearing or governing such a

family, she could not deem herself barren, or her life useless and

unprofitable: that if she ever entertained thoughts of changing her

condition, the care of her subjects’ welfare would still be uppermost in

her thoughts; but should she live and die a virgin, she doubted not but

divine Providence, seconded by their counsels and her own measures, would

be able to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession, and secure

them a sovereign who, perhaps better than her own issue, would imitate her

example in loving and cherishing her people; and that for her part, she

desired that no higher character, or fairer remembrance of her should be

transmitted to posterity, than to have this inscription engraved on her

tombstone, when she should pay the last debt to nature: “Here lies

Elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden queen.”[*]

 

After the prorogation of the parliament,[**] the laws enacted with regard

to religion were put in execution, and met with little opposition from any

quarter. The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue, and the

oath of supremacy was tendered to the clergy. The number of bishops had

been reduced to fourteen by a sickly season which preceded: and all these,

except the bishop of Landaff, having refused compliance, were degraded

from their sees: but of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where

there are near ten thousand parishes, only eighty rectors and vicars,

fifty prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges, twelve archdeacons, and as

many deans, sacrificed their livings to their religious principles.[***]

 

Those in high ecclesiastic stations, being exposed to the eyes of the

public, seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their

perseverance; but on the whole, the Protestants, in the former change

introduced by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and conscientious.

Though the Catholic religion, adapting itself to the senses, and enjoining

observances which enter into the common train of life, does at present lay

faster hold on the mind than the reformed, which, being chiefly spiritual,

resembles more a system of metaphysics, yet was the proportion of zeal, as

well as of knowledge, during the first ages after the reformation, much

greater on the side of the Protestants. The Catholics continued,

ignorantly and supinely, in their ancient belief, or rather their ancient

practices: but the reformers, obliged to dispute on every occasion, and

inflamed to a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly

attached themselves to their tenets; and were ready to sacrifice their

fortunes, and even their lives, in support of their speculative and

abstract principles.

 

The forms and ceremonies still preserved in the English liturgy, as they

bore some resemblance to the ancient service, tended further to reconcile

the Catholics to the established religion; and as the queen permitted no

other mode of worship, and at the same time struck out every thing that

could be offensive to them in the new liturgy,[*] even those who were

addicted to the Romish communion made no scruple of attending the

established church. Had Elizabeth gratified her own inclinations, the

exterior appearance, which is the chief circumstance with the people,

would have been still more similar between the new and the ancient form of

worship. Her love of state and magnificence, which she affected in every

thing, inspired her with an inclination towards the pomp of the Catholic

religion; and it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her

party, that she gave up either images, or the addresses to saints, or

prayers for the dead.[**] Some foreign princes interposed to procure the

Romanists the privilege of separate assemblies in particular cities, but

the queen would not comply with their request; and she represented the

manifest danger of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of

different religions.[***]

 

While the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public

religion, the negotiations for a peace were still conducted, first at

Cercamp, then at Chateau-Cambresis, between the ministers of France,

Spain, and England; and Elizabeth, though equally prudent, was not equally

successful in this transaction. Philip employed his utmost efforts to

procure the restitution of Calais, both as bound in honor to indemnify

England which merely on his account had been drawn into the war; and as

engaged in interest to remove France to a distance from his frontiers in

the Low Countries. So long as he entertained hopes of espousing the queen,

he delayed concluding a peace with Henry; and even after the change of

religion in England deprived him of all such views, his ministers hinted

to her a proposal which may be regarded as reasonable and honorable.

Though all his own terms with France were settled, he seemed willing to

continue the war till she should obtain satisfaction; provided she would

stipulate to adhere to the Spanish alliance, and continue hostilities

against Henry during the course of six years:[*]* but Elizabeth, after

consulting with her ministers, wisely rejected this proposal. She was

sensible of the low state of her finances; the great debts contracted by

her father, brother, and sister; the disorders introduced into every part

of the administration; the divisions by which her people were agitated;

and she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity during some years

could bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition, or enable her

to act with dignity and vigor in her transactions with foreign nations.

Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon Calais, and the

impossibility, during the present emergence, of recovering it by treaty,

she was willing rather to suffer that loss, than submit to such a

dependence on Spain, as she must expect to fall into, if she continued

pertinaciously in her present demand. She ordered, therefore, her

ambassadors, Lord Effingham, the bishop of Ely, and Dr. Wotton, to

conclude the negotiation, and to settle a peace with Henry on any

reasonable terms. Henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the eldest

daughter of the dauphin, and the eldest son of Elizabeth; and to engage

for the restitution of Calais as the dowry of that princess;[**] but as

the queen was sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a

palpable evasion, she insisted upon more equitable, at least more

plausible conditions.

 

Philip and Henry terminated hostilities by a mutual restitution of all

places taken during the course of the war; and Philip espoused the

princess Elizabeth, eldest daughter of France, formerly betrothed to his

son Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry’s sister, and

obtained a restitution of all his dominions of Savoy and Piedmont, except

a few towns retained by France. And thus general tranquillity seemed to be

restored to Europe.

 

But though peace was concluded between France and England, there soon

appeared a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature, and which was

afterwards attended with the most important consequences. The two

marriages of Henry VIII., that with Catharine of Arragon, and that with

Anne Boleyn, were incompatible with each other; and it seemed impossible

that both of them could be regarded as valid and legal: but still the

birth of Elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her

sister Mary was not exposed. Henry’s first marriage had obtained the

sanction of all the powers, both civil and ecclesiastical, which were then

acknowledged in England; and it was natural for Protestants as well as

Romanists to allow, on account of the sincere intention of the parties,

that their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate, But his divorce and

second marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to the see of

Rome; and though they had been ratified by the authority both of the

English parliament and convocation, those who were strongly attached to

the Catholic communion, and who reasoned with great strictness were led to

regard them as entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the queen’s right

of succession. The next heir of blood was the queen of Scots, now married

to the dauphin; and the great power of that princess, joined to her

plausible title rendered her a formidable rival to Elizabeth. The king of

France had secretly been soliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication

against the queen; and she had here been beholden to the good offices of

Philip, who, from interest more than either friendship or generosity, had

negotiated in her favor, and had successfully opposed the pretensions of

Henry. But the court of France was not discouraged with this repulse; the

duke of Guise and his brothers, thinking that it would much augment their

credit if their niece should bring an accession of England, as she had

already done of Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the king not to

neglect the claim; and, by their persuasion, he ordered his son and

daughter-in-law to assume openly the arms as well as title of England, and

to quarter these arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries.

When the English ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain

nothing but an evasive answer; that as the queen of Scots was descended

from the blood royal of England, she was entitled, by the example of many

princes, to assume the arms of that kingdom. But besides that this

practice had never prevailed without permission being first obtained, and

without making a visible difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly

saw that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her

sister Mary; and that, therefore, the king of France intended, on the

first opportunity, to dispute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown.

Alarmed at the danger, she thenceforth conceived a violent jealousy

against the queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as possible, to

incapacitate Henry from the execution of his project. The sudden death of

that monarch, who was killed in a tournament at Paris, while celebrating

the espousals of his sister with the duke of Savoy, altered not her views.

Being informed that his successor, Francis II., still continued to assume,

without reserve, the title of King of England, she began to consider him

and his queen as her mortal enemies; and the present situation of affairs

in Scotland afforded her a favorable opportunity, both of revenging the

injury, and providing for her own safety.

 

The murder of the cardinal-primate at St. Andrew’s had deprived the

Scottish Catholics of a head whose severity, courage, and capacity had

rendered him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion; and the

execution of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be more remiss.

The queen regent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate counsels;

and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state

to the bigotry or interests of the clergy, she deemed it more expedient to

temporize, and to connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not

power entirely to repress. When informed of the death of Edward, and the

accession of Mary to the crown of England, she entertained hopes that the

Scottish reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from

that powerful kingdom, would lose their ardor with their prospect of

success, and would gradually return to the faith of their ancestors. But

the progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual

maxims of civil policy; and the event much disappointed the expectations

of the regent. Many of the English preachers, terrified with the severity

of Mary’s government, took shelter in Scotland, where they found more

protection, and a milder administration; and while they propagated their

theological tenets, they filled the whole kingdom with a just horror

against the cruelties of the bigoted Catholics, and showed their disciples

the fate which they must expect, if ever their adversaries should attain

an uncontrolled authority over them.

 

A hierarchy, moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches, may safely

grant a toleration to sectaries; and the more it softens the zeal of

innovators by lenity and liberty, the more securely will it possess those

advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon it. But where

superstition has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as that of

Rome, persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests, than of a

necessary policy; and the rigor of law is the only method of repelling the

attacks of men who, besides religious zeal, have so many other motives,

derived both from public and private interest, to engage them on the side

of innovation. But though such overgrown hierarchies may long support

themselves by these violent expedients, the time comes when severities

tend only to enrage the new sectaries, and make them break through all

bounds of reason and moderation. This crisis was now visibly approaching

in Scotland; and whoever considers merely the transactions resulting from

it, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever

enlarges his view, and reflects on the situations, will remark the

necessary progress of human affairs, and the operation of those principles

which are inherent in human nature.

 

Some heads of the reformers in Scotland, such as the earl of Argyle, his

son Lord Lorne, the earls of Morton and Glencarne, Erskine of Dun, and

others, observing the danger to which they were exposed, and desirous to

propagate their principles, entered privately into a bond or association;

and called themselves the “congregation” of the Lord, in contradistinction

to the established church, which they denominated the congregation of

Satan. The tenor of the bond was as follows: “We, perceiving how Satan, in

his members, the Antichrist of our time, do cruelly rage, seeking to

overthrow and to destroy the gospel of Christ and his congregation, ought,

according to our bounden duty, to strive in our master’s cause, even unto

the death, being certain of the victory in him. We do therefore promise,

before the majesty of God and his congregation, that we, by his grace,

shall with all diligence continually apply our whole power, substance, and

our very lives, to maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed

word of God and his congregation; and shall labor, by all possible means,

to have faithful ministers, truly and purely to minister Christ’s gospel

and sacraments to his people: we shall maintain them, nourish them, and

defend them, the whole congregation of Christ, and every member thereof,

by our whole power, and at the hazard of our lives, against Satan, and all

wicked power who may intend tyranny and trouble against the said

congregation; unto which holy word and congregation we do join ourselves;

and we forsake and renounce the congregation of Satan, with all the

superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof; and moreover shall declare

ourselves manifestly enemies thereto, by this faithful promise before God,

testified to this congregation by our subscriptions. At Edinburgh, the

third of December, 1557.”[*]

 

Had the subscribers of this zealous league been content only to demand a

toleration of the new opinions, however incompatible their pretensions

might have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would have had

the praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted to support an

establishment prejudicial to civil society: but it is plain that they

carried their views much further; and their practice immediately

discovered the spirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the

authority which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the

Lord, they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue[*] should be used in

all the parish churches of the kingdom; and that preaching and the

interpretation of the Scriptures should be practised in private houses,

til God should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful and

true ministers.[**] Such bonds of association are always the fore-runners

of rebellion; and this violent invasion of the established religion was

the actual commencement of it.

 

Before this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy, alarmed with

the progress of the reformation, attempted to recover their lost authority

by a violent exercise of power, which tended still further to augment the

zeal and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate, seized Walter

Mill, a priest of an irreproachable life, who had embraced the new

doctrines; and having tried him at St. Andrew’s, condemned him to the

flames for heresy. Such general aversion was entertained against this

barbarity, that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any

one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce sentence upon Mill;

and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the shops of St.

Andrew’s being shut, no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake and

the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement. The man bore

the torture with that courage which, though usual on these occasions,

always appears supernatural and astonishing to the multitude. The people,

to express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests, raised a

monument of stones on the place of his execution; and as fast as the

stones were removed by order of the clergy, they were again supplied from

the voluntary zeal of the populace.[***] It is in vain for men to oppose

the severest punishment to the united motives of religion and public

applause; and this was the last barbarity of the kind which the Catholics

had the power to exercise in Scotland.

 

Some time after, the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner

as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was

awaiting them. It was usual on the festival of St. Giles, the tutelar

saint of Edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of that saint; but

the Protestants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means, on the eve

of the festival, to purloin the statue from the church; and they pleased

themselves with imagining the surprise and disappointment of his votaries.

The clergy, however, framed hastily a new image, which in derision was

called by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it through the

streets, attended by all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighborhood.

The multitude abstained from violence so long as the queen regent

continued a spectator; but the moment she retired, they invaded the idol,

threw it in the mire, and broke it in pieces. The flight and terror of the

priests and friars, who, it was remarked, deserted, in his greatest

distress, the object of their worship, was the source of universal mockery

and laughter.

 

Encouraged by all these appearances, the congregation proceeded with

alacrity in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league; and the death

of Mary of England, with the accession of Elizabeth, which happened about

this time, contributed to increase their hopes of final success in their

undertaking. They ventured to present a petition to the regent, craving a

reformation of the church, and of the “wicked, scandalous, and detestable”

lives of the prelates and ecclesiastics.[*] They framed a petition which

they intended to present to parliament, and in which, after premising that

they could not communicate with the damnable idolatry and intolerable

abuses of the Papistical church, they desired that the laws against

heretics should be executed by the civil magistrate alone, and that the

Scripture should be the sole rule in judging of heresy.[**] They even

petitioned the convocation, and insisted that prayers should be said in

the vulgar tongue, and that bishops should be chosen with the consent of

the gentry of the diocese, and priests with the consent of the

parishioners.[***] The regent prudently temporized between these parties;

and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her son-in-law the

dauphin, she was, on that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to

extremities with either of them.

 

But after this concession was obtained, she received orders from France,

probably dictated by the violent spirit of her brothers, to proceed with

rigor against the reformers, and to restore the royal authority by some

signal act of power.[*] She made the more eminent of the Protestant

teachers be cited to appear before the council at Stirling; but when their

followers were marching thither in great multitudes, in order to protect

and countenance them, she entertained apprehensions of an insurrection,

and, it is said, dissipated the people by a promise[**] 2 that

nothing should be done to the prejudice of the ministers. Sentence,

however, was passed, by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels, on

account of their not appearing; a measure which enraged the people, and

made them resolve to oppose the regent’s authority by force of arms, and

to proceed to extremities against the clergy of the established religion.

 

In this critical time, John Knox arrived from Geneva, where he had passed

some years in banishment, and where he had imbibed, from his commerce with

Calvin, the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by the native

ferocity of his own character. He had been invited back to Scotland by the

leaders of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at Perth, during the

present ferment of men’s minds, he declaimed with his usual vehemence

against the idolatry and other abominations of the church of Rome, and

incited his audience to exert their utmost zeal for its subversion. A

priest was so imprudent, after this sermon, as to open his repository of

images and relics, and prepare himself to say mass. The audience, exalted

to a disposition for any furious enterprise, were as much enraged as if

the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them: they attacked the

priest with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures, overthrew

the altars, scattered about the sacred vases; and left no implement of

idolatrous worship, as they termed it, entire or undefaced. They thence

proceeded, with additional numbers and augmented rage, to the monasteries

of the Gray and Black friars, which they pillaged in an instant: the

Carthusians underwent the same fate: and the populace, not content with

robbing and expelling the monks, vented their fury on the buildings which

had been the receptacles of such abomination; and in a little time nothing

but the walls of these edifices were left standing. The inhabitants of

Coupar, in Fife, soon after imitated the example.[***]

 

The queen regent, provoked at these violences, assembled an army, and

prepared to chastise the rebels. She had about two thousand French under

her command, with a few Scottish troops; and being assisted by such of the

nobility as were well affected to her, she pitched her camp within ten

miles of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and Lord James Stuart, prior of

St. Andrew’s, the queen’s natural brother, though deeply engaged with the

reformers, attended the regent in this enterprise, either because they

blamed the fury of the populace, or hoped by their own influence and

authority to mediate some agreement between the parties. The congregation,

on the other hand, made preparations for defence; and being joined by the

earl of Glencarne from the west, and being countenanced by many of the

nobility and gentry, they appeared formidable from their numbers, as well

as from the zeal by which they were animated. They sent an address to the

regent, where they plainly insinuated, that if they were pursued to

extremities by the “cruel beasts” the churchmen, they would have recourse

to foreign powers for assistance; and they subscribed themselves her

faithful subjects in all things not repugnant to God, assuming, at the

same time, the name of the faithful congregation of Christ Jesus.[*] They

applied to the nobility attending her, and maintained, that their own past

violences were justified by the word of God, which commands the godly to

destroy idolatry, and all the monuments of it; and though all civil

authority was sacred, yet was there a great difference between the

authority and the persons who exercised it;[**] and that it ought to be

considered, whether or not those abominations, called by the pestilent

Papists religion, and which they defend by fire and sword, be the true

religion of Christ Jesus. They remonstrated with such of the queen’s army

as had formerly embraced their party, and told them, “that as they were

already reputed traitors by God, they should likewise be excommunicated

from their society, and from the participation of the sacraments of the

church which God by his mighty power had erected among them; whose

ministers have the same authority which Christ granted to his apostles in

these words, ‘Whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven, and whose

sins ye shall retain shall be retained.’”[***]

 

We may here see, that these new saints were no less lofty in their

pretensions than the ancient hierarchy: no wonder they were enraged

against the latter as their rivals in dominion. They joined to all these

declarations an address to the established church; and they affixed this

title to it: “To the generation of Antichrist, the pestilent prelates and

their ‘shavelings'[*] in Scotland, the congregation of Christ Jesus within

the same sayeth.” The tenor of the manifesto was suitable to the title.

They told the ecclesiastics, “As ye by tyranny intend not only to destroy

our bodies, but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage of the

devil, subject to idolatry, so shall we, with all the force and power

which God shall grant unto us, execute just vengeance and punishment upon

you: yea, we shall begin that same war which God commanded Israel to

execute against the Canaanites; that is, contract of peace shall never be

made till you desist from your open idolatry, and cruel persecution of

God’s children. And this, in the name of the eternal God, and of his Son

Christ Jesus, whose verity we profess, and gospel we have preached, and

holy sacraments rightly administered, we signify unto you to be our

intent, so far as God will assist us to withstand your idolatry. Take this

for warning, and be not deceived.”[**] With these outrageous symptoms

commenced in Scotland that cant, hypocrisy, and fanaticism which long

infested that kingdom, and which, though now mollified by the lenity of

the civil power, is still ready to break out on all occasions.

 

The queen regent, finding such obstinate zeal in the rebels, was content

to embrace the counsels of Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew’s, and to

form an accommodation with them. She was received into Perth, which

submitted, on her promising an indemnity for past offences, and engaging

not to leave any French garrison in the place. Complaints, very ill

founded, immediately arose concerning the infraction of this capitulation.

Some of the inhabitants, it was pretended, were molested on account of the

late violences; and some companies of Scotch soldiers, supposed to be in

French pay, were quartered in the town; which step, though taken on very

plausible grounds, was loudly exclaimed against by the congregation.[***]

 

It is asserted that the regent, to justify these measures, declared, that

princes ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon them; nor

was any faith to be kept with heretics: and that for her part, could she

find as good a color, she would willingly bereave all these men of their

lives and fortunes.[*] But it is nowise likely that such expressions ever

dropped from this prudent and virtuous princess. On the contrary, it

appears that all these violences were disagreeable to her; that she was in

this particular overruled by the authority of the French counsellors

placed about her; and that she often thought, if the management of those

affairs had been intrusted wholly to herself, she could easily, without

force, have accommodated all differences.[**] 3
 

The congregation, inflamed with their own zeal, and enraged by these

disappointments, remained not long in tranquillity. Even before they left

Perth, and while as yet they had no color to complain of any violation of

treaty, they had signed a new covenant, in which, besides their

engagements to mutual defence, they vowed, in the name of God, to employ

their whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his holy name;

and this covenant was subscribed, among others, by Argyle and the prior of

St. Andrew’s.[***]

 

These two leaders now desired no better pretence for deserting the regent

and openly joining their associates, than the complaints, however

doubtful, or rather false, of her breach of promise. The congregation

also, encouraged by this accession of force, gave themselves up entirely

to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at Crail, Anstruther, and other

places in Fife, like depredations on the churches and monasteries with

those formerly committed at Perth and Coupar. The regent, who marched

against them with her army, finding their power so much increased, was

glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and to pass over with her forces

to the Lothians. The reformers besieged and took Perth; proceeded thence

to Stirling, where they exercised their usual fury; and finding nothing

able to resist them, they bent their march to Edinburgh, the inhabitants

of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the congregation

against the churches and monasteries, gladly opened their gates to them.

The regent, with the few forces which remained with her, took shelter in

Dunbar, where she fortified herself, in expectation of a reÃ«nforcement

from France.

 

Meanwhile, she employed her partisans in representing to the people the

dangerous consequences of this open rebellion; and she endeavored to

convince them, that the Lord James, under pretence of religion, had formed

the scheme of wresting the sceptre from the hands of the sovereign. By

these considerations many were engaged to desert the army of the

congregation; but much more by the want of pay, or any means of

subsistence; and the regent, observing the malecontents to be much

weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a design of suppressing

them. On the interposition of the duke of Chatelrault, who still adhered

to her, she agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a

toleration of their religion, and they engaged to commit no further

depredations on the churches. Soon after, they evacuated the city; and

before they left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they

took care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves, and they

were guilty of an imposture, in adding one to the number, namely, that

idolatry should not again be erected in any place where it was at that

time suppressed.[*] 4
 

An agreement concluded while men were in this disposition, could not be

durable; and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as

possible against the ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The

regent, having got a reÃ«nforcement of one thousand men from France, began

to fortify Leith; and the congregation seduced to their party the duke of

Chatelrault, who had long appeared inclined to join them, and who was at

last determined by the arrival of his son, the earl of Arran, from France,

where he had escaped many dangers from the jealousy, as well as bigotry,

of Henry and the duke of Guise. More French troops soon after disembarked

under the command of La Brosse, who was followed by the bishop of Amiens,

and three doctors of the Sorbonne. These last were supplied with store of

syllogisms, authorities, citations, and scholastic arguments, which they

intended to oppose to the Scottish preachers, and which, they justly

presumed, would acquire force, and produce conviction, by the influence of

the French arms and artillery.[**]

 

The constable Montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the dauphin

with the queen of Scots, and had foretold that, by forming such close

connections with Scotland, the ancient league would be dissolved; and the

natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would soon become,

instead of allies, attached by interest and inclination, the most

inveterate enemies to the French government. But though the event seemed

now to have justified the prudence of that aged minister, it is not

improbable, considering the violent counsels by which France was governed,

that the insurrection was deemed a favorable event; as affording a

pretence for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the country, for

attainting the rebels,[*] and for preparing means thence to invade

England, and support Mary’s title to the crown of that kingdom. The

leaders of the congregation, well acquainted with these views, were not

insensible of their danger, and saw that their only safety consisted in

the vigor and success of their measures. They were encouraged by the

intelligence received of the sudden death of Henry II.; and having passed

an act from their own authority, depriving the queen dowager of the

regency, and ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom, they

collected forces to put their edict in execution against them. They again

became masters of Edinburgh; but found themselves unable to keep long

possession of that city. Their tumultuary armies, assembled in haste, and

supported by no pay, soon separated upon the least disaster, or even any

delay of success; and were incapable of resisting such veteran troops as

the French, who were also seconded by some of the Scottish nobility, among

whom the earl of Bothwell distinguished himself., Hearing that the marquis

of Elbeuf, brother to the regent, was levying an army against them in

Germany, they thought themselves excusable for applying, in this

extremity, to the assistance of England; and as the sympathy of religion,

as well as regard to national liberty, had now counterbalanced the ancient

animosity against that kingdom, this measure was the result of inclination

no less than of interest.[**] 5 Maitland of Lidington, therefore, and Robert

Melvil, were secretly despatched by the congregation to solicit succors

from Elizabeth.

 

The wise council of Elizabeth did not long deliberate in agreeing to this

request, which concurred so well with the views and interests of their

mistress. Cecil in particular represented to the queen, that the union of

the crowns of Scotland and France, both of them the hereditary enemies of

England, was ever regarded as a pernicious event; and her father, as well

as Protector Somerset, had employed every expedient both of war and

negotiation to prevent it: that the claim which Mary advanced to the crown

rendered the present situation of England still more dangerous, and

demanded on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance and precaution;

that the capacity, ambition, and exorbitant views of the family of Guise,

who now governed the French counsels, were sufficiently known; and they

themselves made no secret of their design to place their niece on the

throne of England: that deeming themselves secure of success, they had

already, somewhat imprudently and prematurely, taken off the mask; and

Throgmorton, the English ambassador at Paris, sent over, by every courier,

incontestable proofs of their hostile intentions:[*] that they only waited

till Scotland should be entirely subdued; and having thus deprived the

English of the advantages resulting from their situation and naval power,

they prepared means for subverting the queen’s authority: that the zealous

Catholics in England, discontented with the present government, and

satisfied in the legality of Mary’s title, would bring them considerable

reÃ«nforcement, and would disturb every measure of defence against that

formidable power: that the only expedient for preventing these designs,

was to seize the present opportunity, and take advantage of a like zeal in

the Protestants of Scotland; nor could any doubt be entertained with

regard to the justice of a measure founded on such evident necessity, and

directed only to the ends of self-preservation: that though a French war,

attended with great expense, seemed the necessary consequence of

supporting the malecontents in Scotland, that power, if removed to the

continent, would be much less formidable; and a small disbursement at

present would, in the end, be found the greatest frugality: and that the

domestic dissensions of France, which every day augmented, together with

the alliance of Philip, who, notwithstanding his bigotry and hypocrisy,

would never permit the entire conquest of England, were sufficient to

secure the queen against the dangerous ambition and resentment of the

house of Guise.[**]

 

Elizabeth’s propensity to caution and economy was, though with some

difficulty,[*] overcome by these powerful motives and she prepared herself

to support by arms and money the declining affairs of the congregation in

Scotland. She equipped a fleet, which consisted of thirteen ships of war;

and giving the command of it to Winter, she sent it to the Frith of Forth:

she appointed the young duke of Norfolk her lieutenant in the northern

counties; and she assembled, at Berwick, an army of eight thousand men

under the command of Lord Gray, warden of the east and middle marches.

Though the court of France, sensible of the danger, offered her to make

immediate restitution of Calais, provided she would not interpose in the

affairs of Scotland, she resolutely replied, that she never would put an

inconsiderable fishing-town in competition with the safety of her

dominions;[**] and she still continued her preparations. She concluded a

treaty of mutual defence with the congregation, which was to last during

the marriage of the queen of Scots with Francis, and a year after; and she

promised never to desist till the French had entirely evacuated

Scotland.[***] And having thus taken all proper measures for success, and

received from the Scots six hostages for the performance of articles, she

ordered her fleet and army to begin their operations.

 

1560.

 

The appearance of Elizabeth’s fleet in the frith disconcerted the French

army, who were at that time ravaging the county of Fife; and obliged them

to make a circuit by Stirling, in order to reach Leith, where they

prepared themselves for defence. The English army, reÃ«nforced by five

thousand Scots,[*] sat down before the place; and after two skirmishes, in

the former of which the English had the advantage, in the latter the

French, they began to batter the town; and, though repulsed with

considerable loss in a rash and ill-conducted assault, they reduced the

garrison to great difficulties. Their distress was augmented by two

events; the dispersion by a storm of D’Elbeuf’s fleet, which carried a

considerable army on board,[**] and the death of the queen, regent, who

expired about this time in the Castle of Edinburgh; a woman endowed with

all the capacity which shone forth in her family, but possessed of much

more virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other

branches of it. The French, who found it impossible to subsist for want of

provisions, and who saw that the English were continually reÃ«nforced by

fresh numbers, were obliged to capitulate; and the bishop of Valence and

Count Randan, plenipotentiaries from France, signed a treaty at Edinburgh

with Cecil and Dr. Wotton, whom Elizabeth had sent thither for that

purpose. It was there stipulated, that the French should instantly

evacuate Scotland; that the king and queen of France and Scotland should

thenceforth abstain from bearing the arms of England, or assuming the

title of that kingdom; that further satisfaction for the injury already

done in that particular should be granted Elizabeth; and that

commissioners should meet to settle this point, or, if they could not

agree, that the king of Spain should be umpire between the crowns. Besides

these stipulations, which regarded England, some concessions were granted

to the Scots; namely, that an amnesty should be published for all past

offences; that none but natives should enjoy any office in Scotland; that

the states should name twenty-four persons, of whom the queen of Scots

should choose seven, and the states five, and in the hands of these twelve

should the whole administration be placed during their queen’s absence;

and that Mary should neither make peace nor war without consent of the

states.[***] In order to hasten the execution of this important treaty,

Elizabeth sent ships, by which the French forces were transported into

their own country.

 

Thus Europe saw, in the first transaction of this reign, the genius and

capacity of the queen and her ministers. She discerned at a distance the

danger which threatened her; and instantly took vigorous measures to

prevent it. Making all possible advantages of her situation, she proceeded

with celerity to a decision; and was not diverted by any offers,

negotiations, or remonstrances of the French court. She stopped not till

she had brought the matter to a final issue; and had converted that very

power, to which her enemies trusted for her destruction, into her firmest

support and security. By exacting no improper conditions from the Scottish

malecontents, even during their greatest distresses, she established an

entire confidence with them; and having cemented the union by all the ties

of gratitude, interest, and religion, she now possessed an influence over

them beyond what remained even with their native sovereign. The regard

which she acquired by this dexterous and spirited conduct, gave her every

where, abroad as well as at home, more authority than had attended her

sister, though supported by all the power of the Spanish monarchy.[*]

 

The subsequent measures of the Scottish reformers tended still more to

cement their union with England. Being now entirely masters of the

kingdom, they made no further ceremony or scruple in fully effecting their

purpose. In the treaty of Edinburgh, it had been agreed, that a parliament

or convention should soon be assembled; and the leaders of the

congregation, not waiting till the queen of Scots should ratify that

treaty, thought themselves fully entitled, without the sovereign’s

authority, immediately to summon a parliament. The reformers presented a

petition to this assembly, in which they were not contented with desiring

the establishment of their doctrine, they also applied for the punishment

of the Catholics, whom they called vassals to the Roman harlot; and they

asserted, that among all the rabble of the clergy—such is their

expression—there was not one lawful minister; but that they were all

of them thieves and murderers; yea, rebels and traitors to civil

authority, and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed

commonwealth.[**] The parliament seem to have been actuated by the same

spirit of rage and persecution. After ratifying a confession of faith

agreeable to the new doctrines, they passed a statute against the mass,

and not only abolished it in all the churches, but enacted, that whoever

any where either officiated in it, or was present at it, should be

chastised, for the first offence, with confiscation of goods and corporal

punishment, at the discretion of the magistrate; for the second, with

banishment; and for the third, with loss of life.[***]

 

A law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in Scotland:

the Presbyterian form of discipline was settled, leaving only at first

some shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics, whom they called

superintendents. The prelates of the ancient faith appeared, in order to

complain of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their

property, but the parliament took no notice of them; till at last these

ecclesiastics, tired with fruitless attendance, departed the town. They

were then cited to appear; and as nobody presented himself, it was voted

by the parliament, that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and

found no reason of complaint.

 

Sir James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was sent over to France to obtain

the ratification of these acts; but was very ill received by Mary, who

denied the validity of a parliament summoned without the royal consent;

and she refused her sanction to those statutes. But the Protestants gave

themselves little concern about their queen’s refusal. They immediately

put the statutes in execution; they abolished the mass; they settled their

ministers; they committed every where furious devastations on the

monasteries, and even on the churches, which they thought profaned by

idolatry; and deeming the property of the clergy lawful prize, they took

possession, without ceremony, of the far greater part of the

ecclesiastical revenues. Their new preachers, who had authority sufficient

to incite them to war and insurrection, could not restrain their rapacity;

and fanaticism concurring with avarice, an incurable wound was given to

the papal authority in that country. The Protestant nobility and gentry,

united by the consciousness of such unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their

new possessions, well acquainted with the imperious character of the house

of Guise, saw no safety for themselves but in the protection of England;

and they despatched Morton, Glencarne, and Lidington, to express their

sincere gratitude to the queen for her past favors, and represent to her

the necessity of continuing them.

 

Elizabeth, on her part, had equal reason to maintain a union with the

Scottish Protestants; and soon found that the house of Guise,

notwithstanding their former disappointments, had not laid aside the

design of contesting her title, and subverting her authority. Francis and

Mary, whose counsels were wholly directed by them, refused to ratify the

treaty of Edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her any satisfaction

for that mortal affront which they had put upon her, by their openly

assuming the title and arms of England. She was sensible of the danger

attending such pretensions; and it was with pleasure she heard of the

violent factions which prevailed in the French government, and of the

opposition which had arisen against the measures of the duke of Guise.

That ambitious prince, supported by his four brothers, the cardinal of

Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,

men no less ambitious than himself, had engrossed all the authority of the

crown; and as he was possessed of every quality which could command the

esteem or seduce the affections of men, there appeared no end of his

acquisitions and pretensions. The constable, Montmorency, who had long

balanced his credit, was deprived of all power: the princes of the blood,

the king of Navarre, and his brother, the prince of CondÃ©, were entirely

excluded from offices and favor: the queen mother herself, Catharine de

Medicis, found her influence every day declining; and as Francis, a young

prince, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly governed by his consort,

who knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles, men despaired of ever

obtaining freedom from the dominion of that aspiring family. It was the

contests of religion which first inspired the French with courage openly

to oppose their unlimited authority.

 

The theological disputes, first started in the north of Germany, next in

Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had long ago

penetrated into France; and as they were assisted by the general

discontent against the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous spirit

of the age, the proselytes to the new religion were secretly increasing in

every province. Henry II., in imitation of his father, Francis, had

opposed the progress of the reformers; and though a prince addicted to

pleasure and society, he was transported by a vehemence, as well as

bigotry, which had little place in the conduct of his predecessor.

Rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the

Protestant party; and a point of honor seemed to have arisen, whether the

one sect could exercise, or the other suffer, most barbarity. The death of

Henry put some stop to the persecutions; and the people, who had admired

the constancy of the new preachers, now heard with favor their doctrines

and arguments. But the cardinal of Lorraine, as well as his brothers, who

were possessed of the legal authority, thought it their interest to

support the established religion; and when they revived the execution of

the penal statutes, they necessarily drove the malecontent princes and

nobles to embrace the protection of the new religion. The king of Navarre,

a man of mild dispositions, but of a weak character, and the prince of

CondÃ©, who possessed many great qualities, having declared themselves in

favor of the Protestants, that sect acquired new force from their

countenance; and the admiral, Coligny, with his brother Andelot, no longer

scrupled to make open profession of their communion. The integrity of the

admiral, who was believed sincere in his attachment to the new doctrine,

and his great reputation both for valor and conduct, for the arts of peace

as well as of war brought credit to the reformers; and after a frustrated

attempt of the malecontents to seize the king’s person at Amboise of which

Elizabeth had probably some intelligence,[*] every place was full of

distraction, and matters hastened to an open rupture between the parties.

But the house of Guise, though these factions had obliged them to remit

their efforts in Scotland, and had been one chief cause of Elizabeth’s

success, were determined not to relinquish their authority in France, or

yield to the violence of their enemies. They found an opportunity of

seizing the king of Navarre and the prince of CondÃ©; they threw the former

into prison; they obtained a sentence of death against the latter; and

they were proceeding to put the sentence in execution, when the king’s

sudden death saved the noble prisoner, and interrupted the prosperity of

the duke of Guise. The queen mother was appointed regent to her son

Charles IX., now in his minority: the king of Navarre was named

lieutenant-general of the kingdom: the sentence against CondÃ© was

annulled: the constable was recalled to court: and the family of Guise,

though they still enjoyed great offices and great power, found a

counterpoise to their authority.

 

1561.

 

Elizabeth was determined to make advantage of these events against the

queen of Scots, whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival. She saw

herself freed from the perils attending a union of Scotland with France,

and from the pretensions of so powerful a prince as Francis; but she

considered, at the same time, that the English Catholics, who were

numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favor of Mary’s title,

would now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment, when they

saw that her succession no longer endangered the liberties of the kingdom,

and was rather attended with the advantage of effecting an entire union

with Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her ambassador, Throgmorton,

a vigilant and able minister, to renew his applications to the queen of

Scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh. But

though Mary had desisted, after her husband’s death, from bearing the arms

and title of Queen of England, she still declined gratifying Elizabeth in

this momentous article; and being swayed by the ambitious suggestions of

her uncles, she refused to make any formal renunciation of her

pretensions.

 

Meanwhile the queen mother of France, who imputed to Mary all the

mortifications which she had met with during Francis’s lifetime, took care

to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the queen of Scots, finding her

abode in France disagreeable, began to think of returning to her native

country. Lord James, who had been sent in deputation from the states to

invite her over, seconded these intentions; and she applied to Elizabeth,

by D’Oisel, for a safe-conduct, in case she should be obliged to pass

through England;[*] but she received for answer, that, till she had given

satisfaction, by ratifying the treaty of Edinburgh, she could expect no

favor from a person whom she had so much injured.

 

This denial excited her indignation; and she made no scruple of expressing

her sentiments to Throgmorton, when he reiterated his applications to

gratify his mistress in a demand which he represented as so reasonable.

Having cleared the room of her attendants, she said to him, “How weak I

may prove, or how far a woman’s frailty may transport me, I cannot tell:

however, I am resolved not to have so many witnesses of my infirmity as

your mistress had at her audience of my ambassador D’Oisel. There is

nothing disturbs me so much, as the having asked, with so much impunity, a

favor which it was of no consequence for me to obtain. I can, with God’s

leave, return to my own country without her leave; as I came to

France, in spite of all the opposition of her brother, King Edward:

neither do I want friends both able and willing to conduct me home, as

they have brought me hither; though I was desirous rather to make an

experiment of your mistress’s friendship, than of the assistance of any

other person. I have often heard you say, that a good correspondence

between her and myself would conduce much to the security and happiness of

both our kingdoms: were she well convinced of this truth, she would hardly

have denied me so small a request. But perhaps she bears a better

inclination to my rebellious subjects than to me, their sovereign, her

equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the undoubted heir of her

kingdoms. Besides her friendship, I ask nothing at her hands: I neither

trouble her, nor concern myself in the affairs of her state: not that I am

ignorant, that there are now in England a great many malecontents, who are

no friends to the present establishment. She is pleased to upbraid me as a

person little experienced in the world: I freely own it; but age will cure

that defect. However, I am already old enough to acquit myself honestly

and courteously to my friends and relations, and to encourage no reports

of your mistress which would misbecome a queen and her kinswoman. I would

also say, by her leave, that I am a queen as well as she, and not

altogether friendless: and, perhaps, I have as great a soul too; so that

methinks we should be upon a level in our treatment of each other. As soon

as I have consulted the states of my kingdom, I shall be ready to give her

a seasonable answer; and I am the more intent on my journey, in order to

make the quicker despatch in this affair. But she, it seems, intends to

stop my journey; so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction,

or is resolved not to be satisfied; perhaps on purpose to keep up the

disagreement between us. She has often reproached me with my being young;

and I must be very young indeed, and as ill advised, to treat of matters

of such great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament.

I have not been wanting in all friendly offices to her; but she

disbelieves or overlooks them. I could heartily wish that I were as nearly

allied to her in affection as in blood; for that indeed would be a most

valuable alliance.”[*]

 

Such a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed in

it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival

princesses, or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken place.

Elizabeth equipped a fleet on pretence of pursuing pirates, but probably

with an intention of intercepting the queen of Scots in her return

homewards. Mary embarked at Calais; and passing the English fleet in a

fog, arrived safely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of

Aumale, the grand prior, and the marquis of Elbeuf, together with the

marquis of Damville and other French courtiers. This change of abode and

situation was very little agreeable to that princess. Besides her natural

prepossessions in favor of a country in which she had been educated from

her earliest infancy, and where she had borne so high a rank, she could

not forbear both regretting the society of that people, so celebrated for

their humane disposition and their respectful attachment to their

sovereign, and reflecting on the disparity of the scene which lay before

her. It is said, that after she was embarked at Calais, she kept her eyes

fixed on the coast of France, and never turned them from that beloved

object till darkness fell, and intercepted it from her view. She then

ordered a couch to be spread for her in the open air; and charged the

pilot, that, if in the morning the land were still in sight, he should

awake her, and afford her one parting view of that country in which all

her affections were centred. The weather proved calm, so that the ship

made little way in the night-time; and Mary had once more an opportunity

of seeing the French coast. She sat up on her couch, and still looking

towards the land, often repeated these words: “Farewell, France, farewell,

I shall never see thee more.”[*] The first aspect, however, of things in

Scotland was more favorable, if not to her pleasure and happiness, at

least to her repose and security, than she had reason to apprehend. No

sooner did the French galleys appear off Leith, than people of all ranks,

who had long expected their arrival, flocked towards the shore with an

earnest impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign. Some were

led by duty, some by interest, some by curiosity; and all combined to

express their attachment to her, and to insinuate themselves into her

confidence on the commencement of her administration. She had now reached

her nineteenth year; and the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her

person were further recommended by the affability of her address, the

politeness of her manners, and the elegance of her genius. Well

accomplished in all the superficial but engaging graces of a court, she

afforded, when better known, still more promising indications of her

character; and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging

deportment, and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of

music, eloquence, and poetry.[**] And as the Scots had long been deprived

of the presence of their sovereign, whom they once despaired ever more to

behold among them, her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction; and

nothing appeared about the court but symptoms of affection, joy, and

festivity.

 

The first measures which Mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions

entertained in her favor. She followed the advice given her in France by

D’Oisel and the bishop of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and she bestowed

her confidence entirely on the leaders of the reformed party, who had

greatest influence over the people, and who, she found, were alone able to

support her government. Her brother, Lord James, whom she soon after

created earl of Murray, obtained the chief authority; and after him

Lidington, secretary of state, a man of great sagacity, had a principal

share in her confidence. By the vigor of these men’s measures, she

endeavored to establish order and justice in a country divided by public

factions and private feuds; and that fierce, intractable people,

unacquainted with laws and obedience, seemed, for a time, to submit

peaceably to her gentle and prudent administration.

 

But there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising

appearances, and bereaved Mary of that general favor which her agreeable

manners and judicious deportment gave her just reason to expect. She was

still a Papist, and though she published, soon after her arrival, a

proclamation enjoining every one to submit to the established religion,

the preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a person

polluted with so great an abomination, nor lay aside their jealousies of

her future conduct. It was with great difficulty she could obtain

permission for saying mass in her own chapel; and had not the people

apprehended, that if she had here met with a refusal, she would instantly

have returned to France, the zealots never would have granted her even

that small indulgence. The cry was, “Shall we suffer that idol to be again

erected within the realm?” It was asserted in the pulpit, that one mass

was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the

kingdom:[*] Lord Lindesey, and the gentlemen of Fife, exclaimed, “that the

idolater should die the death;” such was their expression. One that

carried tapers for the ceremony of that worship was attacked and insulted

in the court of the palace. And if Lord James and some popular leaders had

not interposed, the most dangerous uproar was justly apprehended from the

ungoverned fury of the multitude.[**]

 

The usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose: that God would

turn the queen’s heart, which was obstinate against him and his truth; or

if his holy will be otherwise, that he would strengthen the hearts and

hands of the elect, stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants.[*] Nay, it

was openly called in question, whether that princess, being an idolatress,

was entitled to any authority, even in civil matters.[**]

 

The helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely, which she bore

with benignity and patience. Soon after her arrival, she dined in the

Castle of Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy, six years of

age, should be let down from the roof, and should present her with a

Bible, a Psalter, and the keys of the castle. Lest she should be at a loss

to understand this insult on her as a Papist, all the decorations

expressed the burning of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, and other punishments

inflicted by God upon idolatry.[***] The town council of Edinburgh had the

assurance, from their own authority, to issue a proclamation banishing

from their district “all the wicked rabble of Antichrist the pope, such as

priests, monks, friars, together with adulterers and fornicators.”[****]

And because the privy council suspended the magistrates for their

insolence, the passionate historians[v] of that age have inferred that the

queen was engaged, by a sympathy of manners, to take adulterers and

fornicators under her protection. It appears probable, that the

magistrates were afterwards reinstated in their office, and that their

proclamation was confirmed.[v*]

 

But all the insolence of the people was inconsiderable in comparison of

that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers, who took a pride

in vilifying, even to her face, this amiable princess. The assembly of the

church framed an address, in which, after telling her that her mass was a

bastard service of God, the fountain of all impiety, and the source of

every evil which abounded in the realm, they expressed their hopes, that

she would ere this time have preferred truth to her own preconceived

opinion, and have renounced her religion, which, they assured her, was

nothing but abomination and vanity. They said, that the present abuses of

government were so enormous, that if a speedy remedy were not provided,

God would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the tail, the

disobedient prince and sinful people. They required, that severe

punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators. And they

concluded with demanding for themselves some addition both of power and

property.[*]

 

The ringleader in all these insults on majesty was John Knox; who

possessed an uncontrolled authority in the church and even in the civil

affairs of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of his

sovereign. His usual appellation for the queen was Jezebel; and though she

endeavored by the most gracious condescension to win his favor, all her

insinuations could gain nothing on his obdurate heart. She promised him

access to her whenever he demanded it; and she even desired him, if he

found her blamable in any thing, to reprehend her freely in private,

rather than vilify her in the pulpit before the whole people: but he

plainly told her, that he had a public ministry intrusted to him; that if

she would come to church, she should there hear the gospel of truth, and

that it was not his business to apply to every individual, nor had he

leisure for that occupation.[**] The political principles of the man,

which he communicated to his brethren, were as full of sedition, as his

theological were of rage and bigotry. Though he once condescended so far

as to tell the queen that he would submit to her, in the same manner as

Paul did to Nero,[***] he remained not long in this dutiful strain. He

said to her, that “Samuel feared not to slay Agag the fat and delicate

king of Amalek, whom King Saul had saved; neither spared Elias Jezebel’s

false prophets, and Baal’s priests, though King Ahab was present.

Phineas,” added he, “was no magistrate; yet feared he not to strike Cosbi

and Zimri in the very act of filthy fornication. And so, madam, your grace

may see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment

on such crimes as are condemned by the law of God.”[****] Knox had

formerly, during the reign of Mary of England, written a book against

female succession to the crown: the title of it is, “The first blast of

the trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women.” He was too proud

either to recant the tenets of this book, or even to apologize for them;

and his conduct showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty due

to any of the female sex.

 

The whole life of Mary was, from the demeanor of these men, filled with

bitterness and sorrow. This rustic apostle scruples not, in his history,

to inform us, that he once treated her with such severity, that she lost

all command of temper, and dissolved in tears before him: yet so far from

being moved with youth, and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to that

condition, he persevered in his insolent reproofs; and when he relates

this incident, he discovers a visible pride and satisfaction in his own

conduct.[*] The pulpits had become mere scenes of railing against the

vices of the court; among which were always noted as the principal,

feasting, finery, dancing, balls, and whoredom, their necessary

attendant.[**] Some ornaments, which the ladies at that time wore upon

their petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the preachers; and

they affirmed, that such vanity would provoke God’s vengeance not only

against these foolish women, but against the whole realm.[***]

 

Mary, whose age, condition, and education, invited her to liberty and

cheerfulness, was curbed in all amusements by the absurd severity of these

reformers; and she found every moment reason to regret her leaving that

country, from whose manners she had in her early youth received the first

impressions.[****] Her two uncles, the duke of Aumale and the grand prior,

with the other French nobility, soon took leave of her: the marquis of

Elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his departure, she was left to

the society of her own subjects; men unacquainted with the pleasures of

conversation, ignorant of arts and civility, and corrupted, beyond their

usual rusticity, by a dismal fanaticism, which rendered them incapable of

all humanity or improvement. Though Mary had made no attempt to restore

the ancient religion, her Popery was a sufficient crime: though her

behavior was hitherto irreproachable, and her manners sweet and engaging,

her gayety and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity. And to

the harsh and preposterous usage which this princess met with may, in

part, be ascribed those errors of her subsequent conduct which seemed so

little of a piece with the general tenor of her character.

 

There happened to the marquis of Elbeuf, before his departure, an

adventure which, though frivolous, might enable him to give Mary’s friends

in France a melancholy idea of her situation. This nobleman, with the earl

of Bothwell and some other young courtiers, had been engaged, after a

debauch, to pay a visit to a woman called Alison Craig, who was known to

be liberal of her favors; and because they were denied admittance, they

broke the windows, thrust open the door, and committed some disorders in

searching for the damsel. It happened that the assembly of the church was

sitting at that time, and they immediately took the matter under their

cognizance. In conjunction with several of the nobility, they presented an

address to the queen, which was introduced with this awful prelude: “To

the queen’s majesty, and to her secret and great council, her grace’s

faithful and obedient subjects, the professors of Christ Jesus’s holy

evangil, wish the spirit of righteous judgment.” The tenor of the petition

was that the fear of God, the duty which they owed her grace, and the

terrible threatenings denounced by God against every city or country where

horrible crimes were openly committed, compelled them to demand the severe

punishment of such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God

against the whole realm; that the iniquity of which they complained was so

heinous and so horrible that they should esteem themselves accomplices in

it, if they had been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance, to

pass it over in silence, or bury it in oblivion: that as they owed her

grace obedience, in the administration of justice, so were they entitled

to require of her, in return, the sharp and condign punishment of this

enormity, which, they repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God on

the whole kingdom: and that they maintained it to be her duty to lay aside

all private affections towards the actors in so heinous a crime, and so

enormous a villany, and without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict

the severest penalty upon them. The queen gave a gracious reception to his

peremptory address, but because she probably thought that breaking the

windows of a brothel merited not such severe reprehension, she only

replied, that her uncle was a stranger, and that he was attended by a

young company; but she would put such order to him and to all others that

her subjects should henceforth have no reason to complain. Her passing

over this incident so slightly was the source of great discontent, and was

regarded as a proof of the most profligate manners.[*]

 

It is not to be omitted, that Alison Craig, the cause of all the uproar

was known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran, who, on account

of his great zeal for the reformation, was, without scruple, indulged in

that enormity.[*]

 

Some of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the queen’s chapel during her

absence, and committed outrages; for which two of them were indicted, and

it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox wrote circular letters to

the most considerable zealots of the party, and charged them to appear in

town and protect their brethren. The holy sacraments, he there said, are

abused by profane Papists; the mass has been said; and in worshipping that

idol, the priests have omitted no ceremony, not even the conjuring of

their accursed water, that had ever been practised in the time of the

greatest blindness. These violent measures for opposing justice were

little short of rebellion; and Knox was summoned before the council to

answer for his offence. The courage of the man was equal to his insolence.

He scrupled not to tell the queen that the pestilent Papists who had

inflamed her against these holy men were the sons of the devil; and must

therefore obey the directions of their father, who had been a liar and a

manslayer from the beginning. The matter ended with the full acquittal of

Knox.[**] Randolph, the English ambassador in Scotland, had reason to

write to Cecil, speaking of the Scottish nation, “I think marvellously of

the wisdom of God, that gave this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome

people no more power nor substance; for they would otherwise run

wild.”[***]

 

We have related these incidents at greater length than the necessity of

our subject may seem to require; but even trivial circumstances, which

show the manners of the age, are often more instructive, as well as

entertaining, than the great transactions of wars and negotiations, which

are nearly similar in all periods and in all countries of the world.

 

The reformed clergy in Scotland had at that time a very natural reason for

their ill humor; namely, the poverty, or rather beggary, to which they

were reduced. The nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands on all

the property of the regular clergy, without making any provision for the

friars and nuns, whom they turned out of their possessions. The secular

clergy of the Catholic communion, though they lost all ecclesiastical

jurisdiction, still held some of the temporalities of their benefices; and

either became laymen themselves and converted them into private property,

or made conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility, who thus

enriched themselves by the plunder of the church. The new teachers had

hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the faithful; and

in a poor country, divided in religious sentiments, this establishment was

regarded as very scanty and very precarious. Repeated applications were

made for a legal settlement to the preachers; and though almost every

thing in the kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with

difficulty that their request was at last complied with. The fanatical

spirit which they indulged, and their industry in decrying the principles

and practices of the Romish communion, which placed such merit in

enriching the clergy, proved now a very sensible obstacle to their

acquisitions. The convention, however, passed a vote,[*] by which they

divided all the ecclesiastical benefices into twenty-one shares: they

assigned fourteen to the ancient possessors: of the remaining seven they

granted three to the crown; and if that were found to answer the public

expenses, they bestowed the overplus on the reformed ministers. The queen

was empowered to levy all the seven; and it was ordained that she should

afterwards pay to the clergy what should be judged to suffice for their

maintenance. The necessities of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers,

and the small affection which Mary bore to the Protestant ecclesiastics,

rendered their revenues contemptible as well as uncertain; and the

preachers, finding that they could not rival the gentry, or even the

middling rank of men, in opulence and plenty, were necessitated to betake

themselves to other expedients for supporting their authority. They

affected a furious zeal for religion, morose manners, a vulgar and

familiar, yet mysterious cant; and though the liberality of subsequent

princes put them afterwards on a better footing with regard to revenue,

and thereby corrected in some degree those bad habits, it must be

confessed that, while many other advantages attend Presbyterian

government, these inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius

of that ecclesiastical polity.

 

The queen of Scots, destitute of all force, possessing a narrow revenue,

surrounded with a factious, turbulent nobility, a bigoted people, and

insolent ecclesiastics, soon found that her only expedient for maintaining

tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with Elizabeth,[*] who,

by former connections and services, had acquired such authority over all

these ranks of men.

 

Soon after her arrival in Scotland, Secretary Lidington was sent to

London, in order to pay her compliments to the queen, and express her

desire of friendship and a good correspondence; and he received a

commission from her, as well as from the nobility of Scotland, to demand,

as a means of cementing this friendship, that Mary should, by act of

parliament or by proclamation, (for the difference between these

securities was not then deemed very considerable,) be declared successor

to the crown. No request could be more unreasonable, or made at a more

improper juncture. The queen replied, that Mary had once discovered her

intention not to wait for the succession, but had openly, without ceremony

or reserve, assumed the title of Queen of England, and had pretended a

superior right to her throne and kingdom: that though her ambassadors and

those of her husband, the French king, had signed a treaty, in which they

renounced that claim, and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity,

she was so intoxicated with this imaginary right, that she had rejected

the most earnest solicitations, and even, as some endeavored to persuade

her, had incurred some danger, in crossing the seas, rather than ratify

that equitable treaty: that her partisans every where had still the

assurance to insist on her title, and had presumed to talk of her own

birth as illegitimate: that while affairs were on this footing; while a

claim thus openly made, so far from being openly renounced, was only

suspended till a more favorable opportunity; it would in her be the most

egregious imprudence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown by

declaring her the successor: that no expedient could be worse imagined for

cementing friendship than such a declaration; and kings were often found

to bear no good will to their successors, even though their own children;

much more when the connection was less intimate, and when such cause of

disgust and jealousy had already been given, and indeed was still

continued, on the part of Mary: that though she was willing, from the

amity which she bore her kinswoman, to ascribe her former pretensions to

the advice of others, by whose direction she was then governed, her

present refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own

prepossessions, and was a proof that she still harbored some dangerous

designs against her: that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted

with the present, to entertain flattering views of futurity, to think

their services ill rewarded, to expect a better recompense from the

successor; and she should esteem herself scarcely half a sovereign over

the English, if they saw her declare her heir, and arm her rival with

authority against her own repose and safety: that she knew the inconstant

nature of the people; she was acquainted with the present divisions in

religion; she was not ignorant that the same party, which expected greater

favor during the reign of Mary, did also imagine that the title of that

princess was superior to her own: that for her part, whatever claims were

advanced, she was determined to live and die queen of England; and after

her death it was the business of others to examine who had the best

pretensions, either by the laws or by right of blood, to the succession:

that she hoped the claim of the queen of Scots would then be found solid;

and, considering the injury which she herself had received, it was

sufficient indulgence if she promised, in the mean time, to do nothing

which might in any respect weaken or invalidate it: and that Mary, if her

title were really preferable—a point which, for her own part, she

had never inquired into—possessed all advantages above her rivals;

who, destitute both of present power and of all support by friends, would

only expose themselves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even

doubtful pretensions.[*]

 

These views of the queen were so prudent and judicious, that there was no

likelihood of her ever departing from them: but that she might put the

matter to a fuller proof, she offered to explain the words of the treaty

of Edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding Mary’s right

of succession;[**] and in this form she again required her to ratify that

treaty. Matters at last came to this issue, that Mary agreed to the

proposal, and offered to renounce all present pretensions to the crown of

England, provided Elizabeth would agree to declare her the successor.[***]

But such was the jealous character of this latter princess, that she never

would consent to strengthen the interest and authority of any claimant by

fixing the succession; much less would she make this concession in favor

of a rival queen, who possessed such plausible pretensions for the

present, and who, though she might verbally renounce them, could easily

resume her claim on the first opportunity.

 

Mary’s proposal, however, bore so specious an appearance of equity and

justice, that Elizabeth, sensible that reason would, by superficial

thinkers, be deemed to lie entirely on that side, made no more mention of

the matter; and though further concessions were never made by either

princess, they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconciliation and

friendship with each other.

 

The queen observed that, even without her interposition, Mary was

sufficiently depressed by the mutinous spirit of her own subjects; and

instead of giving Scotland for the present any inquietude or disturbance,

she employed herself, more usefully and laudably, in regulating the

affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness of her people. She

made some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon the crown;

she regulated the coin, which had been much debased by her predecessors;

she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of arms from Germany and

other places; engaged her nobility and gentry to imitate her example in

this particular; introduced into the kingdom the art of making gunpowder

and brass cannon; fortified her frontiers on the side of Scotland; made

frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture, by allowing a

free exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and so much

increased the shipping of her kingdom, both by building vessels of force

herself, and suggesting like undertakings to the merchants, that she was

justly styled the restorer of naval glory, and the queen of the northern

seas.[*] The natural frugality of her temper, so far from incapacitating

her for these great enterprises, only enabled her to execute them with

greater certainty and success; and all the world, saw in her conduct the

happy effects of a vigorous perseverance in judicious and well-concerted

projects.

 

It is easy to imagine that so great a princess, who enjoyed such singular

felicity and renown, would receive proposals of marriage from every one

that had any likelihood of succeeding; and though she had made some public

declarations in favor of a single life, few believed that she would

persevere forever in that resolution. The archduke Charles, second son of

the emperor,[*] as well as Casimir, son of the elector palatine, made

applications to her; and as this latter prince professed the reformed

religion, he thought himself, on that account, better entitled to succeed

in his addresses. Eric, king of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Holstein, were

encouraged by the same views to become suitors: and the earl of Arran,

heir to the crown of Scotland, was, by the states of that kingdom,

recommended to her as a suitable marriage.

 

Even some of her own subjects, though they did not openly declare their

pretensions, entertained hopes of success. The earl of Arundel, a person

declining in years, but descended from an ancient and noble family, as

well as possessed of great riches, flattered himself with this prospect;

as did also Sir William Pickering, a man much esteemed for his personal

merit. But the person most likely to succeed, was a younger son of the

late duke of Northumberland, Lord Robert Dudley, who, by means of his

exterior qualities, joined to address and flattery, had become in a manner

her declared favorite, and had great influence in all her counsels. The

less worthy he appeared of this distinction, the more was his great favor

ascribed to some violent affection, which could thus seduce the judgment

of this penetrating princess; and men long expected that he would obtain

the preference above so many princes and monarchs. But the queen gave all

these suitors a gentle refusal, which still encouraged their pursuit; and

thought that she should the better attach them to her interest, if they

were still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions.

It is also probable that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture

of female coquetry; and that, though she was determined in her own mind

never to share her power with any man, she was not displeased with the

courtship, solicitation, and professions of love, which the desire of

acquiring so valuable a prize procured her from all quarters.

 

What is most singular in the conduct and character of Elizabeth is, that

though she determined never to have any heir of her own body, she was not

only very averse to fix any successor to the crown, but seems, also, to

have resolved, as far as it lay in her power, that no one who had

pretensions to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors. If

the exclusion given by the will of Henry VIII. to the posterity of

Margaret, queen of Scotland, was allowed to be valid, the right to the

crown devolved on the house of Suffolk; and the lady Catharine Gray,

younger sister to the lady Jane, was now the heir of that family. This

lady had been married to Lord Herbert, son of the earl of Pembroke; but

having been divorced from that nobleman, she had made a private marriage

with the earl of Hertford, son of the protector; and her husband, soon

after consummation, travelled into France. In a little time she appeared

to be pregnant, which so enraged Elizabeth, that she threw her into the

Tower, and summoned Hertford to appear, in order to answer for his

misdemeanor. He made no scruple of acknowledging the marriage, which,

though concluded without the queen’s consent, was entirely suitable to

both parties; and for this offence he was also committed to the Tower.

Elizabeth’s severity stopped not here: she issued a commission to inquire

into the matter; and as Hertford could not, within the time limited, prove

the nuptials by witnesses, the commerce between him and his consort was

declared unlawful, and their posterity illegitimate. They were still

detained in custody, but by bribing their keepers, they found means to

have further intercourse; and another child appeared to be the fruit of

their commerce. This was a fresh source of vexation to the queen; who made

a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on Hertford by the star chamber

and ordered his confinement to be thenceforth more rigid and severe. He

lay in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by

freeing Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty.[*] This

extreme severity must be accounted for, either by the unrelenting jealousy

of the queen, who was afraid lest a pretender to the succession should

acquire credit by having issue; or by her malignity, which, with all her

great qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and which led her

to envy in others those natural pleasures of love and posterity, of which

her own ambition and desire of dominion made her renounce all prospect for

herself.

 

There happened, about this time, some other events in the royal family

where the queen’s conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole and his brother,

nephews to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke of Clarence,

together with Anthony Fortescue, who had married a sister of these

gentlemen, and some other persons, were brought to their trial for

intending to withdraw into France, with a view of soliciting succors from

the duke of Guise, of returning thence into Wales, and of proclaiming Mary

queen of England, and Arthur Pole duke of Clarence. They confessed the

indictment, but asserted that they never meant to execute these projects

during the queen’s lifetime: they had only deemed such precautions

requisite in case of her demise, which some pretenders to judicial

astrology had assured them they might with certainty look for before the

year expired. They were condemned by the jury; but received a pardon from

the queen’s clemency.[*]
