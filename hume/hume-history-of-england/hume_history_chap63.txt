CHARLES II., when he ascended the throne of his ancestors, was thirty

years of age. He possessed a vigorous constitution, a fine shape, a manly

figure, a graceful air; and though his features were harsh, yet was his

countenance in the main lively and engaging. He was in that period of life

when there remains enough of youth to render the person amiable, without

preventing that authority and regard which attend the years of experience

and maturity. Tenderness was excited by the memory of his recent

adversities. His present prosperity was the object rather of admiration

than of envy. And as the sudden and surprising revolution which restored

him to his regal rights, had also restored the nation to peace, law,

order, and liberty, no prince ever obtained a crown in more favorable

circumstances, or was more blessed with the cordial affection and

attachment of his subjects.

 

This popularity the king, by his whole demeanor and behavior, was well

qualified to support and to increase. To a lively wit and quick

comprehension, he united a just understanding and a general observation

both of men and things. The easiest manners, the most unaffected

politeness, the most engaging gayety, accompanied his conversation and

address. Accustomed during his exile, to live among his courtiers rather

like a companion than a monarch, he retained, even while on the throne,

that open affability which was capable of reconciling the most determined

republicans to his royal dignity. Totally devoid of resentment, as well

from the natural lenity as carelessness of his temper, he insured pardon

to the most guilty of his enemies, and left hopes of favor to his most

violent opponents. From the whole tenor of his actions and discourse, he

seemed desirous of losing the memory of past animosities, and of uniting

every party in an affection for their prince and their native country.

 

Into his council were admitted the most eminent men of the nation, without

regard to former distinctions: the Presbyterians, equally with the

royalists, shared this honor. Annesley was also created earl of Anglesey;

Ashley Cooper, Lord Ashley; Denzil Hollis, Lord Hollis. The earl of

Manchester was appointed lord chamberlain, and Lord Say, privy seal.

Calamy and Baxter, Presbyterian clergymen, were even made chaplains to the

king.

 

Admiral Montague, created earl of Sandwich, was entitled from his recent

services to great favor; and he obtained it. Monk, created duke of

Albemarle, had performed such signal services, that, according to a vulgar

and malignant observation, he ought rather to have expected hatred and

ingratitude; yet was he ever treated by the king with great marks of

distinction. Charles’s disposition, free from jealousy, and the prudent

behavior of the general, who never overrated his merits, prevented all

those disgusts which naturally arise in so delicate a situation. The

capacity, too, of Albemarle was not extensive, and his parts were more

solid than shining. Though he had distinguished himself in inferior

stations, he was imagined, upon familiar acquaintance, not to be wholly

equal to those great achievements which fortune, united to prudence, had

enabled him to perform; and he appeared unfit for the court, a scene of

life to which he had never been accustomed. Morrice, his friend, was

created secretary of state, and was supported more by his patron’s credit

than by his own abilities or experience.

 

But the choice which the king at first made of his principal ministers and

favorites, was the circumstance which chiefly gave contentment to the

nation, and prognosticated future happiness and tranquillity. Sir Edward

Hyde, created earl of Clarendon, was chancellor and prime minister; the

marquis, created duke of Ormond, was steward of the household, the earl of

Southampton, high treasurer; Sir Edward Nicholas, secretary of state.

These men, united together in friendship, and combining in the same

laudable inclinations, supported each other’s credit, and pursued the

interests of the public.

 

Agreeable to the present prosperity of public affairs was the universal

joy and festivity diffused throughout the nation. The melancholy austerity

of the fanatics fell into discredit together with their principles. The

royalists, who had ever affected a contrary disposition, found in their

recent success new motives for mirth and gayety; and it now belonged to

them to give repute and fashion to their manners. From past experience it

had sufficiently appeared, that gravity was very distinct from wisdom,

formality from virtue, and hypocrisy from religion. The king himself, who

bore a strong propensity to pleasure, served, by his powerful and engaging

example, to banish those sour and malignant humors which had hitherto

engendered such confusion. And though the just bounds were undoubtedly

passed, when men returned from their former extreme, yet was the public

happy in exchanging vices pernicious to society, for disorders hurtful

chiefly to the individuals themselves who were guilty of them.

 

It required some time before the several parts of the state, disfigured by

war and faction, could recover their former arrangement; but the

parliament immediately fell into good correspondence with the king; and

they treated him with the same dutiful regard which had usually been paid

to his predecessors. Being summoned without the king’s consent, they

received, at first, only the title of a convention; and it was not till he

passed an act for that purpose, that they were called by the appellation

of parliament. All judicial proceedings, transacted in the name of the

commonwealth or protector, were ratified by a new law. And both houses,

acknowledging the guilt of the former rebellion, gratefully received, in

their own name, and in that of all the subjects, his majesty’s gracious

pardon and indemnity.

 

The king, before his restoration, being afraid of reducing any of his

enemies to despair, and at the same time unwilling that such enormous

crimes as had been committed should receive a total impunity, had

expressed himself very cautiously in his declaration of Breda, and had

promised an indemnity to all criminals, but such as should be excepted by

parliament. He now issued a proclamation declaring that such of the late

king’s judges as did not yield themselves pris-* *-oners within fourteen

days, should receive no pardon. Nine teen surrendered themselves; some

were taken in their flight; others escaped beyond sea.

 

The commons seem to have been more inclined to lenity than the lords. The

upper house, inflamed by the ill usage which they had received, were

resolved, besides the late king’s judges, to except every one who had

sitten in any high court of justice. Nay, the earl of Bristol moved, that

no pardon might be granted to those who had anywise contributed to the

king’s death. So wide an exception, in which every one who had served the

parliament might be comprehended, gave a general alarm; and men began to

apprehend, that this motion was the effect of some court artifice or

intrigue. But the king soon dissipated these fears. He came to the house

of peers, and in the most earnest terms passed the act of general

indemnity. He urged both the necessity of the thing, and the obligation of

his former promise; a promise, he said which he would ever regard as

sacred; since to it he probably owed the satisfaction which at present he

enjoyed of meeting his people in parliament. This measure of the king’s

was received with great applause and satisfaction.

 

After repeated solicitations, the act of indemnity passed both houses, and

soon received the royal assent. Those who had an immediate hand in the

late king’s death, were there excepted: even Cromwell, Ireton, Bradshaw,

and others now dead, were attainted, and their estates forfeited. Vane and

Lambert, though none of the regicides, were also excepted. St. John and

seventeen persons more were deprived of all benefit from this act, if they

ever accepted any public employment. All who had sitten in any illegal

high court of justice were disabled from bearing offices. These were all

the severities which followed such furious civil wars and convulsions.

 

The next business was the settlement of the king’s revenue. In this work,

the parliament had regard to public freedom, as well as to the support of

the crown. The tenures of wards and liveries had long been regarded as a

grievous burden by the nobility and gentry: several attempts had been made

during the reign of James to purchase this prerogative, together with that

of purveyance: and two hundred thousand pounds a year had been offered

that prince in lieu of them; wardships and purveyance had been utterly

abolished by the republican parliament; and even in the present parliament

before the king arrived in England, a bill had been introduced offering

him a compensation for the emolument of these prerogatives. A hundred

thousand pounds a year was the sum agreed to; and half of the excise was

settled in perpetuity upon the crown as the fund whence this revenue

should be levied. Though that impost yielded more profit, the bargain

might be esteemed hard; and it was chiefly the necessity of the king’s

situation which induced him to consent to it. No request of the

parliament, during the present joy, could be refused them.

 

Tonnage and poundage and the other half of the excise, were granted to the

king during life. The parliament even proceeded so far as to vote, that

the settled revenue of the crown for all charges should be one million two

hundred thousand pounds a year; a sum greater than any English monarch had

ever before enjoyed. But as all the princes of Europe were perpetually

augmenting their military force, and consequently their expense, it became

requisite that England, from motives both of honor and security, should

bear some proportion to them, and adapt its revenue to the new system of

politics which prevailed. According to the chancellor’s computation, a

charge of eight hundred thousand pounds a year was at present requisite

for the fleet and other articles, which formerly cost the crown but eighty

thousand.

 

Had the parliament, before restoring the king, insisted on any further

limitations than those which the constitution already imposed, besides the

danger of reviving former quarrels among parties, it would seem that their

precaution had been entirely superfluous. By reason of its slender and

precarious revenue, the crown in effect was still totally dependent. Not a

fourth part of this sum, which seemed requisite for public expenses, could

be levied without consent of parliament; and any concessions, had they

been thought necessary, might, even after the restoration, be extorted by

the commons from their necessitous prince. This parliament showed no

intention of employing at present that engine to any such purposes; but

they seemed still determined not to part with it entirely, or to render

the revenues of the crown fixed and independent. Though they voted in

general, that one million two hundred thousand pounds a year should be

settled on the king, they scarcely assigned any funds which could yield

two thirds of that sum. And they left the care of fulfilling their

engagements to the future consideration of parliament. In all the

temporary supplies which they voted, they discovered the same cautious

frugality. To disband the army, so formidable in itself, and so much

accustomed to rebellion and changes of government, was necessary for the

security both of king and parliament; yet the commons showed great

jealousy in granting the sums requisite for that end. An assessment of

seventy thousand pounds a month was imposed; but it was at first voted to

continue only three months; and all the other sums which they levied for

that purpose, by a poll-bill and new assessments, were still granted by

parcels, as if they were not as yet well assured of the fidelity of the

hand to which the money was intrusted. Having proceeded so far in the

settlement of the nation, the parliament adjourned itself for some time.

 

During the recess of parliament, the object which chiefly interested the

public, was the trial and condemnation of the regicides. The general

indignation attending the enormous crime of which these men had been

guilty, made their sufferings the subject of joy to the people: but in the

peculiar circumstances of that action, in the prejudices of the times, as

well as in the behavior of the criminals, a mind seasoned with humanity

will find a plentiful source of compassion and indulgence. Can any one,

without concern for human blindness and ignorance, consider the demeanor

of General Harrison, who was first brought to his trial? With great

courage and elevation of sentiment, he told the court, that the pretended

crime of which he stood accused, was not a deed performed in a corner; the

sound of it had gone forth to most nations; and in the singular and

marvellous conduct of it, had chiefly appeared the sovereign power of

Heaven: that he himself, agitated by doubts, had often, with passionate

tears, offered up his addresses to the divine Majesty, and earnestly

sought for light and conviction: he had still received assurance of a

heavenly sanction, and returned from these devout supplications with more

serene tranquillity and satisfaction: that all the nations of the earth

were, in the eyes of their Creator, less than a drop of water in the

bucket; nor were their erroneous judgments aught but darkness, compared

with divine illuminations: that these frequent relapses of the divine

spirit he could not suspect to be interested illusions; since he was

conscious, that for no temporal advantage would he offer injury to the

poorest man or woman that trod upon the earth: that all the allurements of

ambition, all the terrors of imprisonment, had not been able, during the

usurpation of Cromwell, to shake his steady resolution, or bend him to a

compliance with that deceitful tyrant: and that when invited by him to sit

on the right hand of the throne, when offered riches and splendor and

dominion, he had disdainfully rejected all temptations; and neglecting the

tears of his friends and family, had still, through every danger, held

fast his principles and his integrity.

 

Scot, who was more a republican than a fanatic, had said in the house of

commons, a little before the restoration, that he desired no other epitaph

to be inscribed on his tombstone than this: “Here lies Thomas Scot, who

adjudged the king to death.” He supported the same spirit upon his trial.

 

Carew, a Millenarian, submitted to his trial, “saving to our Lord Jesus

Christ his right to the government of these kingdoms.” Some scrupled to

say, according to form, that they would be tried by God and their country;

because God was not visibly present to judge them. Others said, that they

would be tried by the word of God.

 

No more than six of the late king’s judges, Harrison, Scot, Carew,

Clement, Jones, and Scrope, were executed; Scrope alone, of all those who

came in upon the king’s proclamation. He was a gentleman of good family

and of a decent character: but it was proved, that he had a little before,

in conversation, expressed himself as if he were nowise convinced of any

guilt in condemning the king. Axtel, who had guarded the high court of

justice, Hacker, who commanded on the day of the king’s execution, Coke,

the solicitor for the people of England, and Hugh Peters, the fanatical

preacher, who inflamed the army and impelled them to regicide; all these

were tried, and condemned, and suffered with the king’s judges. No saint

or confessor ever went to martyrdom with more assured confidence of

heaven, than was expressed by those criminals, even when the terrors of

immediate death, joined to many indignities, were set before them. The

rest of the king’s judges, by an unexampled lenity, were reprieved; and

they were dispersed into several prisons.

 

This punishment of declared enemies interrupted not the rejoicings of the

court: but the death of the duke of Gloucester, a young prince of

promising hopes, threw a great cloud upon them. The king, by no incident

in his life, was ever so deeply affected. Gloucester was observed to

possess united the good qualities of both his brothers: the clear judgment

and penetration of the king; the industry and application of the duke of

York. He was also believed to be affectionate to the religion and

constitution of his country. He was but twenty years of age, when the

small-pox put an end to his life.

 

The princess of Orange, having come to England in order to partake of the

joy attending the restoration of her family, with whom she lived in great

friendship, soon after sickened and died. The queen mother paid a visit to

her son; and obtained his consent to the marriage of the princess

Henrietta with the duke of Orleans, brother to the French king.

 

After a recess of near two months, the parliament met, and proceeded in

the great work of the national settlement. They established the

post-office, wine-licenses, and some articles of the revenue. They granted

more assessments, and some arrears for paying and disbanding the army.

Business, being carried on with great unanimity, was soon despatched; and

after they had sitten near two months, the king, in a speech full of the

most gracious expressions, thought proper to dissolve them.

 

This house of commons had been chosen during the reign of the old

parliamentary party; and though many royalists had crept in amongst them,

yet did it chiefly consist of Presbyterians, who had not yet entirely laid

aside their old jealousies and principles. Lenthal, a member, having said,

that those who first took arms against the king were as guilty as those

who afterwards brought him to the scaffold, was severely reprimanded by

order of the house; and the most violent efforts of the long parliament,

to secure the constitution, and bring delinquents to justice, were in

effect vindicated and applauded.[*] The claim of the two houses to the

militia, the first ground of the quarrel, however exorbitant a usurpation,

was never expressly resigned by this parliament. They made all grants of

money with a very sparing hand. Great arrears being due, by the

protectors, to the fleet, the army, the navy office, and every branch of

service, this whole debt they threw upon the crown, without establishing

funds sufficient for its payment. Yet, notwithstanding this jealous care

expressed by the parliament, there prevails a story, that Popham, having

sounded the disposition of the members, undertook to the earl of

Southampton to procure, during the king’s life, a grant of two millions a

year, land tax; a sum which, added to the customs and excise, would

forever have rendered this prince independent of his people.

 

Southampton, it is said, merely from his affection to the king, had

unwarily embraced the offer; and it was not till he communicated the

matter to the chancellor, that he was made sensible of its pernicious

tendency. It is nor improbable, that such an offer might have been made,

and been hearkened to; but it is nowise probable, that all the interest of

the court would ever with this house of commons, have been able to make it

effectual. Clarendon showed his prudence, no less than his integrity, in

entirely rejecting it.

 

The chancellor, from the same principles of conduct, hastened to disband

the army. When the king reviewed these veteran troops, he was struck with

their beauty, order, discipline, and martial appearance; and being

sensible, that regular forces are most necessary implements of royalty, he

expressed a desire of finding expedients still to retain them.

 

But his wise minister set before him the dangerous spirit by which these

troops were actuated, their enthusiastic genius, their habits of rebellion

and mutiny; and he convinced the king, that, till they were disbanded, he

never could esteem himself securely established on his throne. No more

troops were retained than a few guards and garrisons, about one thousand

horse and four thousand foot. This was the first appearance, under the

monarchy, of a regular standing army in this island. Lord Mordaunt said,

that the king, being possessed of that force, might now look upon himself

as the most considerable gentleman in England.[*] The fortifications of

Gloucester, Taunton, and other towns, which had made resistance to the

king during the civil wars, were demolished.

 

Clarendon not only behaved with wisdom and justice in the office of

chancellor; all the counsels which he gave the king tended equally to

promote the interest of prince and people. Charles, accustomed in his

exile to pay entire deference to the judgment of this faithful servant,

continued still to submit to his direction; and for some time no minister

was ever possessed of more absolute authority. He moderated the forward

zeal of the royalists, and tempered their appetite for revenge. With the

opposite party, he endeavored to preserve inviolate all the king’s

engagements: he kept an exact register of the promises which had been made

for any service, he employed all his industry to fulfil them. This good

minister was now nearly allied to the royal family. His daughter, Ann

Hyde, a woman of spirit and fine accomplishments, had hearkened, while

abroad, to the addresses of the duke of York, and under promise of

marriage, had secretly admitted him to her bed. Her pregnancy appeared

soon after the restoration; and though many endeavored to dissuade the

king from consenting to so unequal an alliance, Charles, in pity to his

friend and minister, who had been ignorant of these engagements, permitted

his brother to marry her.[*] Clarendon expressed great uneasiness at the

honor which he had obtained; and said that, by being elevated so much

above his rank, he thence dreaded a more sudden downfall.

 

Most circumstances of Clarendon’s administration have met with applause:

his maxims alone in the conduct of ecclesiastical politics have by many

been deemed the effect of prejudices narrow and bigoted. Had the jealousy

of royal power prevailed so far with the convention parliament as to make

them restore the king with strict limitations, there is no question but

the establishment of Presbyterian discipline had been one of the

conditions most rigidly insisted on. Not only that form of ecclesiastical

government is more favorable to liberty than to royal power; it was

likewise, on its own account, agreeable to the majority of the house of

commons, and suited their religious principles. But as the impatience of

the people, the danger of delay, the general disgust towards faction, and

the authority of Monk, had prevailed over that jealous project of

limitations, the full settlement of the hierarchy, together with the

monarchy, was a necessary and infallible consequence. All the royalists

were zealous for that mode of religion; the merits of the Episcopal clergy

towards the king, as well as their sufferings on that account, had been

great; the laws which established bishops and the liturgy, were as yet

unrepealed by legal authority; and any attempt of the parliament, by new

acts, to give the superiority to Presbyterianism, had been sufficient to

involve the nation again in blood and confusion. Moved by these views, the

commons had wisely postponed the examination of all religious controversy,

and had left the settlement of the church to the king and to the ancient

laws.

 

The king at first used great moderation in the execution of the laws. Nine

bishops still remained alive; and these were immediately restored to their

sees: all the ejected clergy recovered their livings: the liturgy, a form

of worship decent, and not without beauty, was again admitted into the

churches: but at the same time a declaration was issued, in order to give

contentment to the Presbyterians, and preserve an air of moderation and

neutrality.[*] In this declaration, the king promised, that he would

provide suffragan bishops for the larger dioceses; that the prelates

should, all of them, be regular and constant preachers; that they should

not confer ordination, or exercise any jurisdiction, without the advice

and assistance of presbyters chosen by the diocese; that such alterations

should be made in the liturgy as would render it totally unexceptionable;

that, in the mean time, the use of that mode of worship should not be

imposed on such as were unwilling to receive it; and that the surplice,

the cross in baptism, and bowing at the name of Jesus, should not be

rigidly insisted on. This declaration was issued by the king as head of

the church; and he plainly assumed, in many parts of it, a legislative

authority in ecclesiastical matters. But the English government, though

more exactly defined by late contests, was not as yet reduced in every

particular to the strict limits of law. And if ever pre-rogative was

justifiably employed, it seemed to be on the present occasion; when all

parts of the state were torn with past convulsions, and required the

moderating hand of the chief magistrate to reduce them to their ancient

order.

 

But though these appearances of neutrality were maintained, and a

mitigated Episcopacy only seemed to be insisted on, it was far from the

intention of the ministry always to preserve like regard to the

Presbyterians. The madness of the Fifth Monarchy men afforded them a

pretence for departing from it. Venner, a desperate enthusiast, who had

often conspired against Cromwell, having, by his zealous lectures inflamed

his own imagination and that of his followers, issued forth at their head

into the streets of London. They were, to the number of sixty, completely

armed, believed themselves invulnerable and invincible, and firmly

expected the same success which had attended Gideon and other heroes of

the Old Testament Every one at first fled before them. One unhappy man,

who, being questioned, said, “he was for God and King Charles,” was

instantly murdered by them. They went triumphantly from street to street,

every where proclaiming King Jesus, who, they said, was their invisible

leader. At length, the magistrates, having assembled some train bands,

made an attack upon them. They defended themselves with order as well as

valor; and after killing many of the assailants they made a regular

retreat into Cane Wood, near Hampstead. Next morning, they were chased

thence by a detachment of the guards; but they ventured again to invade

the city, which was not prepared to receive them. After committing great

disorder, and traversing almost every street of that immense capital, they

retired into a house, which they were resolute to defend to the last

extremity. Being surrounded, and the house untiled, they were fired upon

from every side; and they still refused quarter. The people rushed in upon

them, and seized the few who were alive. These were tried, condemned, and

executed; and to the last they persisted in affirming, that, if they were

deceived, it was the Lord that had deceived them.

 

Clarendon and the ministry took occasion, from this insurrection, to infer

the dangerous spirit of the Presbyterians, and of all the sectaries: but

the madness of the attempt sufficiently proved, that it had been

undertaken by no concert, and never could have proved dangerous. The

well-known hatred, too, which prevailed between the Presbyterians and the

other sects, should have removed the former from all suspicion of any

concurrence in the enterprise. But as a pretence was wanted, besides their

old demerits, for justifying the intended rigors against all of them, this

reason, however slight, was greedily laid hold of.

 

Affairs in Scotland hastened with still quicker steps then those in

England towards a settlement and a compliance with the king. It was

deliberated in the English council, whether that nation should be restored

to its liberty, or whether the forts erected by Cromwell should not still

be upheld, in order to curb the mutinous spirit by which the Scots in all

ages had been so much governed. Lauderdale, who, from the battle of

Worcester to the restoration, had been detained prisoner in the Tower, had

considerable influence with the king; and he strenuously opposed this

violent measure. He represented that it was the loyalty of the Scottish

nation which had engaged them in an opposition to the English rebels; and

to take advantage of the calamities into which, on that account, they had

fallen, would be regarded as the highest injustice and ingratitude: that

the spirit of that people was now fully subdued by the servitude under

which the usurpers had so long held them, and would of itself yield to any

reasonable compliance with their legal sovereign, if, by this means, they

recovered their liberty and independence: that the attachment of the Scots

towards their king, whom they regarded as their native prince, was

naturally much stronger than that of the English; and would afford him a

sure resource, in case of any rebellion among the latter: that republican

principles had long been, and still were, very prevalent with his southern

subjects, and might again menace the throne with new tumults and

resistance: that the time would probably come, when the king, instead of

desiring to see English garrisons in Scotland, would be better pleased to

have Scottish garrisons in England; who, supported by English pay, would

be fond to curb the seditious genius of that opulent nation: and that a

people, such as the Scots, governed by a few nobility, would more easily

be reduced to submission under monarchy, than one like the English, who

breathed nothing but the spirit of democratical equality.

 

1661

 

These views induced the king to disband all the forces in Scotland, and to

raze all the forts which had been erected. General Middleton, created earl

of that name, was sent commissioner to the parliament, which was summoned.

A very compliant spirit was there discovered in all orders of men. The

commissioner had even sufficient influence to obtain an act, annulling at

once all laws which had passed since the year 1633; on pretext of the

violence which, during that time, had been employed against the king and

his father, in order to procure their assent to these statutes. This was a

very large, if not an unexampled concession; and, together with many

dangerous limitations, overthrew some useful barriers which had been

erected to the constitution. But the tide was now running strongly towards

monarchy; and the Scottish nation plainly discovered, that their past

resistance had proceeded more from the turbulence of their aristocracy,

and the bigotry of their ecclesiastics, than from any fixed passion

towards civil liberty. The lords of articles were restored, with some

other branches of prerogative; and royal authority fortified with more

plausible claims and pretences, was, in its full extent, reestablished in

that kingdom.

 

The prelacy likewise, by the abrogating of every statute enacted in favor

of Presbytery, was thereby tacitly restored; and the king deliberated what

use he should make of this concession. Lauderdale, who at bottom was a

passionate zealot against Episcopacy, endeavored to persuade him, that the

Scots, if gratified in this favorite point of ecclesiastical government,

would, in every other demand, be entirely compliant with the king.

Charles, though he had not so much attachment to prelacy as had influenced

his father and grandfather, had suffered such indignities from the

Scottish Presbyterians, that he ever after bore them a hearty aversion. He

said to Lauderdale, that Presbyterianism, he thought, was not a religion

for a gentleman; and he could not consent to its further continuance in

Scotland. Middleton too and his other ministers persuaded him, that the

nation in general was so disgusted with the violence and tyranny of the

ecclesiastics, that any alteration of church government would be

universally grateful. And Clarendon, as well as Ormond, dreading that the

Presbyterian sect, if legally established in Scotland, would acquire

authority in England and Ireland, seconded the application of these

ministers. The resolution was therefore taken to restore prelacy; a

measure afterwards attended with many and great inconveniencies: but

whether in this resolution Charles chose not the lesser evil, it is very

difficult to determine. Sharp, who had been commissioned by the

Presbyterians in Scotland to manage their interests with the king, was

persuaded to abandon that party; and, as a reward for his compliance, was

created archbishop of St. Andrews. The conduct of ecclesiastical affairs

was chiefly intrusted to him; and as he was esteemed a traitor and a

renegade by his old friends, he became on that account, as well as from

the violence of his conduct, extremely obnoxious to them.

 

Charles had not promised to Scotland any such indemnity as he had insured

to England by the declaration of Breda: and it was deemed more political

for him to hold over men’s heads, for some time, the terror of punishment,

till they should have made the requisite compliances with the new

government. Though neither the king’s temper nor plan of administration

led him to severity, some examples, after such a bloody and triumphant

rebellion, seemed necessary; and the marquis of Argyle and one Guthry were

pitched on as the victims. Two acts of indemnity, one passed by the late

king in 1641, another by the present in 1651, formed, it was thought,

invincible obstacles to the punishment of Argyle, and barred all inquiry

into that part of his conduct which might justly be regarded as the most

exceptionable. Nothing remained but to try him for his compliance with the

usurpation; a crime common to him with the whole nation, and such a one as

the most loyal and affectionate subject might frequently by violence be

obliged to commit. To make this compliance appear the more voluntary and

hearty, there were produced in court letters which he had written to

Albemarle, while that general commanded in Scotland, and which contained

expressions of the most cordial attachment to the established government.

But besides the general indignation excited by Albemarle’s discovery of

this private correspondence, men thought, that even the highest

demonstrations of affection might, during jealous times, be exacted as a

necessary mark of compliance from a person of such distinction as Argyle,

and could not, by any equitable construction, imply the crime of treason.

The parliament, however, scrupled not to pass sentence upon him; and he

died with great constancy and courage. As he was universally known to have

been the chief instrument of the past disorders and civil wars, the

irregularity of his sentence, and several iniquitous circumstances in the

method of conducting his trial, seemed on that account to admit of some

apology. Lord Lorne, son of Argyle, having ever preserved his loyalty,

obtained a gift of the forfeiture. Guthry was a seditious preacher, and

had personally affronted the king: his punishment gave surprise to nobody.

Sir Archibald Johnstone of Warriston was attainted and fled; but was

seized in France about two years after, brought over, and executed. He had

been very active during all the late disorders; and was even suspected of

a secret correspondence with the English regicides.

 

Besides these instances of compliance in the Scottish parliament, they

voted an additional revenue to the king of forty thousand pounds a year,

to be levied by way of excise. A small force was purposed to be maintained

by this revenue, in order to prevent like confusions with those to which

the kingdom had been hitherto exposed. An act was also passed, declaring

the covenant unlawful, and its obligation void and null.

 

In England, the civil distinctions seemed to be abolished by the lenity

and equality of Charles’s administration. Cavalier and roundhead were

heard of no more: all men seemed to concur in submitting to the king’s

lawful prerogatives, and in cherishing he just privileges of the people

and of parliament. Theological controversy alone still subsisted, and kept

alive some sparks of that flame which had thrown the nation into

combustion. While Catholics, Independents, and other sectaries were

content with entertaining some prospect of toleration, Prelacy and

Presbytery struggled for the superiority, and the hopes and fears of both

parties kept them in agitation. A conference was held in the Savoy between

twelve bishops and twelve leaders among the Presbyterian ministers, with

an intention, at least on pretence, of bringing about an accommodation

between the parties. The surplice, the cross in baptism, the kneeling at

the sacrament, the bowing at the name of Jesus, were anew canvassed; and

the ignorant multitude were in hopes, that so many men of gravity and

learning could not fail, after deliberate argumentation, to agree in all

points of controversy: they were surprised to see them separate more

inflamed than ever, and more confirmed in their several prejudices. To

enter into particulars would be superfluous. Disputes concerning religious

forms are, in themselves, the most frivolous of any; and merit attention

only so far as they have influence on the peace and order of civil

society.

 

The king’s declaration had promised, that some endeavors should be used to

effect a comprehension of both parties; and Charles’s own indifference

with regard to all such questions seemed a favorable circumstance for the

execution of that project. The partisans of a comprehension said, that the

Presbyterians, as well as the Prelatists, having felt by experience the

fatal effects of obstinacy and violence, were now well disposed towards an

amicable agreement: that the bishops, by relinquishing some part of their

authority, and dispensing with the most exceptionable ceremonies, would so

gratify their adversaries as to obtain their cordial and affectionate

compliance, and unite the whole nation in one faith and one worship: that

by obstinately insisting on forms, in themselves insignificant, an air of

importance was bestowed on them, and men were taught to continue equally

obstinate in rejecting them: that the Presbyterian clergy would go every

reasonable length, rather than, by parting with their livings, expose

themselves to a state of beggary, at best of dependence: and that if their

pride were flattered by some seeming alterations, and a pretence given

them for affirming that they had not abandoned their former principles,

nothing further was wanting to produce a thorough union between those two

parties, which comprehended the bulk of the nation.

 

It was alleged, on the other hand, that the difference between religious

sects was founded, not on principle, but on passion; and till the

irregular affections of men could be corrected, it was in vain to expect,

by compliances, to obtain a perfect unanimity and comprehension: that the

more insignificant the objects of dispute appeared, with the more

certainty might it be inferred, that the real ground of dissension was

different from that which was universally pretended: that the love of

novelty, the pride of argumentation, the pleasure of making proselytes,

and the obstinacy of contradiction, would forever give rise to sects and

disputes; nor was it possible that such a source of dissension could ever,

by any concessions, be entirely exhausted: that the church, by departing

from ancient practices and principles, would tacitly acknowledge herself

guilty of error, and lose that reverence, so requisite for preserving the

attachment of the multitude; and that if the present concessions (which

was more than probable) should prove ineffectual, greater must still be

made; and in the issue discipline would be despoiled of all its authority,

and worship of all its decency, without obtaining that end which had been

so fondly sought for by these dangerous indulgences.

 

The ministry were inclined to give the preference to the latter arguments;

and were the more confirmed in that intention by the disposition which

appeared in the parliament lately assembled. The royalists and zealous

churchmen were at present the popular party in the nation, and, seconded

by the efforts of the court, had prevailed in most elections. Not more

than fifty-six members of the Presbyterian party had obtained seats in the

lower house; [*] and these were not able either to oppose or retard the

measures of the majority. Monarchy, therefore, and Episcopacy, were now

exalted to as great power and splendor as they had lately suffered misery

and depression. Sir Edward Turner was chosen speaker.

 

An act was passed for the security of the king’s person and government. To

intend or devise the king’s imprisonment, or bodily harm, or deposition,

or levying war against him, was declared, during the lifetime of his

present majesty, to be high treason. To affirm him to be a Papist or

heretic, or to endeavor by speech or writing to alienate his subjects’

affections from him; these offences were made sufficient to incapacitate

the person guilty from holding any employment in church or state. To

maintain that the long parliament is not dissolved, or that either or both

houses, without the king, are possessed of legislative authority, or that

the covenant is binding, was made punishable by the penalty of premunire.

 

The covenant itself, together with the act for erecting the high court of

justice, that for subscribing the engagement, and that for declaring

England a commonwealth, were ordered to be burnt by the hands of the

hangman. The people assisted with great alacrity on this occasion.

 

The abuses of petitioning in the preceding reign had been attended with

the worst consequences; and to prevent such irregular practices for the

future, it was enacted that no more than twenty hands should be fixed to

any petition, unless with the sanction of three justices, or the major

part of the grand jury, and that no petition should be presented to the

king or either house by above ten persons. The penalty annexed to a

transgression of this law was a fine of a hundred pounds and three months’

imprisonment.

 

The bishops, though restored to their spiritual authority, were still

excluded from parliament, by the law which the late king had passed

immediately before the commencement of the civil disorders. Great

violence, both against the king and the house of peers, had been employed

in passing this law; and on that account alone the partisans of the church

were provided with a plausible pretence for repealing it. Charles

expressed much satisfaction when he gave his assent to the act for that

purpose. It is certain that the authority of the crown, as well as that of

the church, was interested in restoring the prelates to their former

dignity. But those who deemed every acquisition of the prince a detriment

to the people, were apt to complain of this instance of complaisance in

the parliament.

 

After an adjournment of some months, the parliament was again assembled,

and proceeded in the same spirit as before. They discovered no design of

restoring, in its full extent, the ancient prerogative of the crown: they

were only anxious to repair all those breaches which had been made, not by

the love of liberty, but by the fury of faction and civil war. The power

of the sword had in all ages been allowed to be vested in the crown; and

though no law conferred this prerogative every parliament, till the last

of the preceding reign, had willingly submitted to an authority more

ancient, and therefore more sacred, than that of any positive statute. It

was now thought proper solemnly to relinquish the violent pretensions of

that parliament, and to acknowledge that neither one house nor both

houses, independent of the king, were possessed of any military authority.

The preamble to this statute went so far as to renounce all right even of

defensive arms against the king; and much observation has been made with

regard to a concession esteemed so singular. Were these terms taken in

their full literal sense, they imply a total renunciation of limitations

to monarchy, and of all privileges in the subject, independent of the will

of the sovereign. For as no rights can subsist without some remedy, still

less rights exposed to so much invasion from tyranny, or even from

ambition; if subjects must never resist, it follows that every prince,

without any effort, policy, or violence, is at once rendered absolute and

uncontrollable; the sovereign needs only issue an edict abolishing every

authority but his own; and all liberty from that moment is in effect

annihilated. But this meaning it were absurd to impute to the present

parliament, who, though zealous royalists, showed in their measures that

they had not cast off all regard to national privileges. They were

probably sensible, that to suppose in the sovereign any such invasion of

public liberty, is entirely unconstitutional; and that therefore expressly

to reserve, upon that event, any right of resistance in the subject, must

be liable to the same objection. They had seen that the long parliament,

under color of defence, had begun a violent attack upon kingly power; and

after involving the kingdom in blood, had finally lost that liberty for

which they had so imprudently contended. They thought, perhaps

erroneously, that it was no longer possible, after such public and such

exorbitant pretensions, to persevere in that prudent silence hitherto

maintained by the laws; and that it was necessary, by some positive

declaration, to bar the return of like inconveniencies. When they excluded,

therefore, the right of defence, they supposed that the constitution,

remaining firm upon its basis, there never really could be an attack made

by the sovereign. If such an attack was at any time made, the necessity

was then extreme; and the case of extreme and violent necessity, no laws,

they thought, could comprehend; because to such a necessity no laws could

beforehand point out a proper remedy.

 

The other measures of this parliament still discovered a more anxious care

to guard against rebellion in the subject than encroachments in the crown;

the recent evils of civil war and usurpation had naturally increased the

spirit of submission to the monarch, and had thrown the nation into that

dangerous extreme. During the violent and jealous government of the

parliament and of the protectors, all magistrates liable to suspicion had

been expelled the corporations; and none had been admitted who gave not

proofs of affection to the ruling powers, or who refused to subscribe the

covenant. To leave all authority in such hands seemed dangerous; and the

parliament therefore empowered the king to appoint commissioners for

regulating the corporations, and expelling such magistrates as either

intruded themselves by violence, or professed principles dangerous to the

constitution, civil and ecclesiastical. It was also enacted, that all

magistrates should disclaim the obligation of the covenant, and should

declare both their belief that it was not lawful, upon any pretence

whatsoever, to resist the king, and their abhorrence of the traitorous

position of taking arms by the king’s authority against his person, or

against those who were commissioned by him.

 

1662

 

The care of the church was no less attended to by this parliament than

that of monarchy; and the bill of uniformity was a pledge of their sincere

attachment to the Episcopal hierarchy, and of their antipathy to

Presbyterianism, Different parties, however, concurred in promoting this

bill, which contained many severe clauses. The Independents and other

sectaries, enraged to find all their schemes subverted by the

Presbyterians, who had once been their associates, exerted themselves to

disappoint that party of the favor and indulgence to which, from their

recent merits in promoting the restoration, they thought themselves justly

entitled. By the Presbyterians, said they, the war was raised; by them was

the populace first incited to tumults; by their zeal, interest, and

riches, were the armies supported; by their force was the king subdued;

and if, in the sequel, they protested against those extreme violences

committed on his person by the military leaders, their opposition came too

late, after having supplied these usurpers with the power and the

pretences by which they maintained their sanguinary measures. They had

indeed concurred with the royalists in recalling the king; but ought they

to be esteemed, on that account, more affectionate to the royal cause?

Rage and animosity, from disappointed ambition, were plainly their sole

motives; and if the king should now be so imprudent as to distinguish them

by any particular indulgences, he would soon experience from them the same

hatred and opposition which had proved so fatal to his father.

 

The Catholics, though they had little interest in the nation, were a

considerable party at court; and from their services and sufferings during

the civil wars, it seemed but just to bear them some favor and regard.

These religionists dreaded an entire union among the Protestants. Were

they the sole nonconformists in the nation, the severe execution of penal

laws upon their sect seemed an infallible consequence; and they used,

therefore, all their interest to push matters to extremity against the

Presbyterians, who had formerly been their most severe oppressors, and

whom they now expected for their companions in affliction. The earl of

Bristol, who, from conviction, or interest, or levity, or complaisance for

the company with whom he lived, had changed his religion during the king’s

exile, was regarded as the head of this party.

 

The church party had, during so many years, suffered such injuries and

indignities from the sectaries of every denomination, that no moderation,

much less deference, was on this occasion to be expected in the

ecclesiastics. Even the laity of that communion seemed now disposed to

retaliate upon their enemies, according to the usual measures of party

justice. This sect or faction (for it partook of both) encouraged the

rumors of plots and conspiracies against the government; crimes which,

without any apparent reason, they imputed to their adversaries. And

instead of enlarging the terms of communion, in order to comprehend the

Presbyterians, they gladly laid hold of the prejudices which prevailed

among that sect, in order to eject them from their livings. By the bill of

uniformity, it was required, that every clergyman should be reordained, if

he had not before received Episcopal ordination; should declare his assent

to every thing contained in the Book of Common Prayer; should take the

oath of canonical obedience; should abjure the solemn league, and

covenant; and should renounce the principle of taking arms on any pretence

whatsoever against the king.

 

This bill reinstated the church in the same condition in which it stood

before the commencement of the civil wars; and as the old persecuting laws

of Elizabeth still subsisted in their full rigor, and new clauses of a

like nature were now enacted, all the king’s promises of toleration and of

indulgence to tender consciences were thereby eluded and broken. It is

true, Charles, in his declaration from Breda, had expressed his intention

of regulating that indulgence by the advice and authority of parliament;

but this limitation could never reasonably be extended to a total

infringement and violation of his engagements. However, it is agreed that

the king did not voluntarily concur with this violent measure; and that

the zeal of Clarendon and of the church party among the commons, seconded

by the intrigues of the Catholics, was the chief cause which extorted his

consent.

 

The royalists, who now predominated, were very ready to signalize their

victory, by establishing those high principles of monarchy which their

antagonists had controverted: but when any real power or revenue was

demanded for the crown, they were neither so forward nor so liberal in

their concessions as the king would gladly have wished. Though the

parliament passed laws for regulating the navy, they took no notice of the

army, and declined giving their sanction to this dangerous innovation. The

king’s debts were become intolerable; and the commons were at last

constrained to vote him an extraordinary supply of one million two hundred

thousand pounds, to be levied by eighteen monthly assessments. But besides

that this supply was much inferior to the occasion, the king was obliged

earnestly to solicit the commons, before he could obtain it; and, in order

to convince the house of its absolute necessity, he desired them to

examine strictly into all his receipts and disbursements. Finding,

likewise, upon inquiry, that the several branches of revenue fell much

short of the sums expected, they at last, after much delay, voted a new

imposition of two shillings on each hearth; and this tax they settled on

the king during life. The whole established revenue, however, did not for

many years exceed a million;[*] a sum confessedly too narrow for the

public expenses. A very rigid frugality at least, which the king seems to

have wanted, would have been requisite to make it suffice for the dignity

and security of government. After all business was despatched, the

parliament was prorogued.

 

Before the parliament rose, the court was employed in making preparations

for the reception of the new queen, Catharine of Portugal, to whom the

king was betrothed, and who had just landed at Portsmouth. During the time

that the protector carried on the war with Spain, he was naturally led to

support the Portuguese in their revolt; and he engaged himself by treaty

to supply them with ten thousand men for their defence against the

Spaniards. On the king’s restoration, advances were made by Portugal for

the renewal of the alliance; and in order to bind the friendship closer,

an offer was made of the Portuguese princess, and a portion of five

hundred thousand pounds, together with two fortresses, Tangiers in Africa,

and Bombay in the East Indies. Spain, who, after the peace of the

Pyrenees, bent all her force to recover Portugal, now in appearance

abandoned by France, took the alarm, and endeavored to fix Charles in an

opposite interest The Catholic king offered to adopt any other princess as

a daughter of Spain, either the princess of Parma, or, what he thought

more popular, some Protestant princess, the daughter of Denmark, Saxony,

or Orange; and on any of these he promised to confer a dowry equal to that

which was offered by Portugal. But many reasons inclined Charles rather to

accept of the Portuguese proposals. The great disorders in the government

and finances of Spain made the execution of her promises be much doubted;

and the king’s urgent necessities demanded some immediate supply of money.

The interest of the English commerce likewise seemed to require that the

independency of Portugal should be supported, lest the union of that crown

with Spain should put the whole treasures of America into the hands of one

potentate. The claims, too, of Spain upon Dunkirk and Jamaica, rendered it

impossible, without further concessions, to obtain the cordial friendship

of that power; and on the other hand, the offer, made by Portugal, of two

such considerable fortresses, promised a great accession to the naval

force of England. Above all, the proposal of a Protestant princess was no

allurement to Charles, whose inclinations led him strongly to give the

preference to a Catholic alliance. According to the most probable

accounts,[*] the resolution of marrying ihe daughter of Portugal was taken

by the king, unknown to all his ministers, and no remonstrances could

prevail with him to alter his intentions.

 

When the matter was laid before the council, all voices concurred in

approving the resolution; and the parliament expressed the same

complaisance. And thus was concluded, seemingly with universal consent,

the inauspicious marriage with Catharine, a princess of virtue, but who

was never able, either by the graces of her person or humor, to make

herself agreeable to the king. The report, however, of her natural

incapacity to have children, seems to have been groundless, since she was

twice declared to be pregnant.[*]

 

The festivity of these espousals was clouded by the trial and execution of

criminals. Berkstead, Cobbet, and Okey, three regicides, had escaped

beyond sea; and after wandering some time concealed in Germany, came

privately to Delft, having appointed their families to meet them in that

place. They were discovered by Downing, the king’s resident in Holland,

who had formerly served the protector and commonwealth in the same

station, and who once had even been chaplain to Okey’s regiment. He

applied for a warrant to arrest them. It had been usual for the states to

grant these warrants; though at the same time, they had ever been careful

secretly to advertise the persons, that they might be enabled to make

their escape. This precaution was eluded by the vigilance and despatch of

Downing. He quickly seized the criminals, hurried them on board a frigate

which lay off the coast, and sent them to England. These three men behaved

with more moderation and submission than any of the other regicides who

had suffered. Okey in particular, at the place of execution, prayed for

the king, and expressed his intention, had he lived, of submitting

peaceably to the established government. He had risen, during the wars,

from being a chandler in London, to a high rank in the army; and in all

his conduct appeared to be a man of humanity and honor. In consideration

of his good character and of his dutiful behavior, his body was given to

his friends to be buried.

 

The attention of the public was much engaged by the trial of two

distinguished criminals, Lambert and Vane. These men, though none of the

late king’s judges, had been excepted from the general indemnity, and

committed to prison. The convention parliament, however, was so favorable

to them, as to petition the king, if they should be found guilty, to

suspend their execution: but this new parliament, more zealous for

monarchy, applied for their trial and condemnation. Not to revive disputes

which were better buried in oblivion, the indictment of Vane did not

comprehend any of his actions during the war between the king and

parliament: it extended only to his behavior after the late king’s death,

as member of the council of state, and secretary of the navy, where

fidelity to the trust reposed in him required his opposition to monarchy.

 

Vane wanted neither courage nor capacity to avail himself of this

advantage. He urged that, if a compliance with the government at that time

established in England, and the acknowledging of its authority, were to be

regarded as criminal, the whole nation had incurred equal guilt, and none

would remain whose innocence could entitle them to try or condemn him for

his pretended treasons: that, according to these maxims, wherever an

illegal authority was established by force, a total and universal

destruction must ensue; while the usurpers proscribed one part of the

nation for disobedience, the lawful prince punished the other for

compliance: that the legislature of England, foreseeing this violent

situation, had provided for public security by the famous statute of Henry

VII.; in which it was enacted that no man, in case of any revolution,

should ever be questioned for his obedience to the king in being: that

whether the established government were a monarchy or a commonwealth, the

reason of the thing was still the same; nor ought the expelled prince to

think himself entitled to allegiance, so long as he could not afford

protection: that it belonged not to private persons, possessed of no

power, to discuss the title of their governors; and every usurpation, even

the most flagrant, would equally require obedience with the most legal

establishment: that the controversy between the late king and his

parliament was of the most delicate nature; and men of the greatest

probity had been divided in their choice of the party which they should

embrace; that the parliament, being rendered indissoluble but by its own

consent, was become a kind of coÃ¶rdinate power with the king; and as the

case was thus entirely new and unknown to the constitution, it ought not

to be tried rigidly by the letter of the ancient laws: that for his part,

all the violences which had been put upon the parliament, and upon the

person of the sovereign, he had ever condemned; nor had he once in the

house for some time before and after the execution of the king: that,

finding the whole government thrown into disorder, he was still resolved,

in every revolution, to adhere to the commons, the root, the foundation,

of all lawful authority: that in prosecution of this principle, he had

cheerfully under gone all the violence of Cromwell’s tyranny; and would

now with equal alacrity, expose himself to the rigors of perverted law and

justice: that though it was in his power, on the king’s restoration, to

have escaped from his enemies, he was determined, in imitation of the most

illustrious names of antiquity, to perish in defence of liberty, and to

give testimony with his blood for that honorable cause in which he had

been enlisted; and that, besides the ties by which God and nature had

bound him to his native country, he was voluntarily engaged by the most

sacred covenant, whose obligation no earthly power should ever be able to

make him relinquish.

 

All the defence which Vane could make was fruitless. The court,

considering more the general opinion of his active guilt in the beginning

and prosecution of the civil wars, than the articles of treason charged

against him, took advantage of the letter of the law, and brought him in

guilty. His courage deserted him not upon his condemnation. Though timid

by nature, the persuasion of a just cause supported him against the

terrors of death, while his enthusiasm, excited by the prospect of glory,

embellished the conclusion of a life, which through the whole course of

it, had been so much disfigured by the prevalence of that principle. Lest

pity for a courageous sufferer should make impression on the populace,

drummers were placed under the scaffold, whose noise, as he began to

launch out in reflections on the government, drowned his voice, and

admonished him to temper the ardor of his zeal. He was not astonished at

this unexpected incident. In all his behavior there appeared a firm and

animated intrepidity; and he considered death but as a passage to that

eternal felicity which he believed to be prepared for him.

 

This man, so celebrated for his parliamentary talents, and for his

capacity in business, has left some writings behind him: they treat, all

of them, of religious subjects, and are absolutely unintelligible: no

traces of eloquence, or even of common sense, appear in them. A strange

paradox! did we not know, that men of the greatest genius, where they

relinquish by principle the use of their reason, are only enabled, by

their vigor of mind, to work themselves the deeper into error and

absurdity. It was remarkable, that as Vane, by being the chief instrument

of Strafford’s death, had first opened the way for that destruction which

overwhelmed the nation, so by his death he closed the scene of blood. He

was the last that suffered on account of the civil wars. Lambert, though

condemned, was reprieved at the bar; and the judges declared, that if

Vane’s behavior had been equally dutiful and submissive, he would have

experienced like lenity in the king. Lambert survived his condemnation

near thirty years. He was confined to the Isle of Guernsey, where he lived

contented, forgetting all his past schemes of greatness, and entirely

forgotten by the nation. He died a Roman Catholic.

 

However odious Vane and Lambert were to the Presbyterians, that party had

no leisure to rejoice at their condemnation. The fatal St. Bartholomew

approached; the day when the clergy were obliged, by the late law, either

to relinquish their livings, or to sign the articles required of them. A

combination had been entered into by the more zealous of the Presbyterian

ecclesiastics to refuse the subscription, in hopes that the bishops would

not venture at once to expel so great a number of the most popular

preachers. The Catholic party at court, who desired a great rent among the

Protestants, encouraged them in this obstinacy, and gave them hopes that

the king would protect them in their refusal. The king himself, by his

irresolute conduct, contributed, either from design or accident, to

increase this opinion. Above all, the terms of subscription had been made

strict and rigid, on purpose to disgust all the zealous and scrupulous

among the Presbyterians, and deprive them of their livings. About two

thousand of the clergy, in one day, relinquished their cures; and, to the

astonishment of the court, sacrificed their interest to their religious

tenets. Fortified by society in their sufferings, they were resolved to

undergo any hardships, rather than openly renounce those principles,

which, on other occasions, they were so apt, from interest, to warp or

elude. The church enjoyed the pleasure of retaliation; and even pushed, as

usual, the vengeance farther than the offence. During the dominion of the

parliamentary party, a fifth of each living had been left to the ejected

clergyman; but this indulgence, though at first insisted on by the house

of peers, was now refused to the Presbyterians. However difficult to

conciliate peace among theologians, it was hoped by many, that some

relaxation in the terms of communion might have kept the Presbyterians

united to the church, and have cured those ecclesiastical factions which

had been so fatal, and were still so dangerous. Bishoprics were offered to

Calamy, Baxter, and Reynolds, leaders among the Presbyterians: the last

only could be prevailed on to accept. Deaneries and other preferments were

refused by many.

 

The next measure of the king has not had the good fortune to be justified

by any party, but is often considered, on what grounds I shall not

determine, as one of the greatest mistakes, if not blemishes, of his

reign. It is the sale of Dunkirk to the French. The parsimonious maxims of

the parliament, and the liberal, or rather careless disposition of

Charles, were ill suited to each other; and notwithstanding the supplies

voted him, his treasury was still very empty and very much indebted. He

had secretly received the sum of two hundred thousand crowns from France

for the support of Portugal, but the forces sent over to that country, and

the fleets maintained in order to defend it, had already cost the king

that sum, and, together with it, near double the money which had been paid

as the queen’s portion.[*] The time fixed for payment of his sister’s

portion to the duke of Orleans was approaching. Tangiers, a fortress from

which great benefit was expected, was become an additional burden to the

crown; and Rutherford, who now commanded in Dunkirk, had increased the

charge of that garrison to a hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year.

These considerations had such influence, not only on the king, but even on

Clarendon, that this uncorrupt minister was the most forward to advise

accepting a sum of money in lieu of a place which, he thought, the king,

from the narrow state of his revenue, was no longer able to retain. By the

treaty with Portugal, it was stipulated that Dunkirk should never be

yielded to the Spaniards; France was therefore the only purchaser that

remained. D’Estrades was invited over by a letter from the chancellor

himself, in order to conclude the bargain. Nine hundred thousand pounds

were demanded: one hundred thousand were offered. The English by degrees

lowered their demand; the French raised their offer: and the bargain was

concluded at four hundred thousand pounds. The artillery and stores were

valued at a fifth of the sum.[**]

 

The importance of this sale was not, at this time, sufficiently known,

either abroad or at home.[*] The French monarch himself, so fond of

acquisitions, and so good a judge of his own interests, thought that he

had made a hard bargain;[**] and this sum, in appearance so small, was the

utmost which he would allow his ambassador to offer.

 

A new incident discovered such a glimpse of the king’s character and

principles as, at first, the nation was somewhat at a loss how to

interpret, but such as subsequent events, by degrees, rendered

sufficiently plain and manifest. He issued a declaration on pretence of

mitigating the rigors contained in the act of uniformity. After expressing

his firm resolution to observe the general indemnity, and to trust

entirely to the affections of his subjects, not to any military power, for

the support of his throne, he mentioned the promises of liberty of

conscience contained in his declaration of Breda. And he subjoined, that,

“as in the first place he had been zealous to settle the uniformity of the

church of England, in discipline, ceremony, and government, and shall ever

constantly maintain it, so, as for what concerns the penalties upon those

who, living peaceably, do not conform themselves thereunto, through

scruple and tenderness of misguided conscience, but modestly and without

scandal perform their devotions in their own way, he should make it his

special care, so far as in him lay, without invading the freedom of

parliament, to incline their wisdom, next approaching sessions, to concur

with him in making some such act for that purpose, as may enable him to

exercise, with a more universal satisfaction, that power of dispensing,

which he conceived to be inherent in him.”[*] Here a most important

prerogative was exercised by the king; but under such artful reserves and

limitations as might prevent the full discussion of the claim, and obviate

a breach between him and his parliament. The foundation of this measure

lay much deeper, and was of the utmost consequence.

 

The king, during his exile, had imbibed strong prejudices a favor of the

Catholic religion; and, according to the most probable accounts, had

already been secretly reconciled in form to the church of Rome. The great

zeal expressed by the parliamentary party against all Papists, had always,

from a spirit of opposition, inclined the court and all the royalists to

adopt more favorable sentiments towards that sect, which, through the

whole course of the civil wars, had strenuously supported the rights of

the sovereign. The rigor, too, which the king, during his abode in

Scotland, had experienced from the Presbyterians, disposed him to run into

the other extreme, and to bear a kindness to the party most opposite in

its genius to the severity of those religionists. The solicitations and

importunities of the queen mother, the contagion of the company which he

frequented, the view of a more splendid and courtly mode of worship, the

hopes of indulgence in pleasure, all these causes operated powerfully on a

young prince, whose careless and dissolute temper made him incapable of

adhering closely to the principles of his early education. But if the

thoughtless humor of Charles rendered him an easy convert to Popery, the

same disposition ever prevented the theological tenets of that sect from

taking any fast hold of him. During his vigorous state of health, while

his blood was warm and his spirits high, a contempt and disregard to all

religion held possession of his mind; and he might more properly be

denominated a deist than a Catholic. But in those revolutions of temper,

when the love of raillery gave place to reflection, and his penetrating,

but negligent understanding was clouded with fears and apprehensions, he

had starts of mere sincere conviction; and a sect which always possessed

his inclination, was then master of his judgment and opinion.[**]

 

But though the king thus fluctuated, during his whole reign, between

irreligion, which he more openly professed, and Popery, to which he

retained a secret propensity, his brother the duke of York, had zealously

adopted all the principles of that theological party. His eager temper and

narrow understanding made him a thorough convert, without any reserve from

interest, or doubts from reasoning and inquiry. By his application to

business, he had acquired a great ascendant over the king; who, though

possessed of more discernment, was glad to throw the burden of affairs on

the duke, of whom he entertained little jealousy. On pretence of easing

the Protestant dissenters, they agreed upon a plan for introducing a

general toleration, and giving the Catholics the free exercise of their

religion; at least the exercise of it in private houses. The two brothers

saw with pleasure so numerous and popular a body of the clergy refuse

conformity; and it was hoped that, under shelter of their name, the small

and hated sect of the Catholics might meet with favor and protection.

But while the king pleaded his early promises of toleration, and insisted

on many other plausible topics, the parliament, who sat a little after the

declaration was issued, could by no means be satisfied with this measure.

The declared intention of easing the dissenters, and the secret purpose of

favoring the Catholics, were equally disagreeable to them and in these

prepossessions they were encouraged by the king’s ministers themselves,

particularly the chancellor. The house of commons represented to the king,

that his declaration of Breda contained no promise to the Presbyterians

and other dissenters, but only an expression of his intentions, upon

supposition of the concurrence of parliament: that even if the

nonconformists had been entitled to plead a promise, they had intrusted

this claim, as all their other rights and privileges, to the house of

commons, who were their representatives, and who now freed the king from

that obligation: that it was not to be supposed, that his majesty and the

houses were so bound by that declaration, as to be incapacitated from

making any laws which might be contrary to it: that even at the king’s

restoration, there were laws of uniformity in force, which could not be

dispensed with but by act of parliament: and that the indulgence intended

would prove most pernicious both to church and state, would open the door

to schism, encourage faction, disturb the public peace, and discredit the

wisdom of the legislature. The king did not think proper, after this

remonstrance, to insist any further at present on the project of

indulgence.

 

In order to deprive the Catholics of all hopes, the two houses concurred

in a remonstrance against them. The king gave a gracious answer; though he

scrupled not to profess his gratitude towards many of that persuasion, on

account of their faithful services in his father’s cause and in his own. A

proclamation, for form’s sake, was soon after issued against Jesuits and

Romish priests: but care was taken, by the very terms of it, to render it

ineffectual. The parliament had allowed, that all foreign priests,

belonging to the two queens, should be excepted, and that a permission for

them to remain in England should still be granted. In the proclamation,

the word foreign was purposely omitted; and the queens were thereby

authorized to give protection to as many English priests as they should

think proper.

 

That the king might reap some advantage from his compliances, however

fallacious, he engaged the commons anew into an examination of his

revenue, which, chiefly by the negligence in levying it, had proved, he

said, much inferior to the public charges. Notwithstanding the price of

Dunkirk, his debts, he complained, amounted to a considerable sum; and to

satisfy the commons that the money formerly granted him had not been

prodigally expended, he offered to lay before them the whole account of

his disbursements. It is, however, agreed on all hands, that the king,

though during his banishment he had managed his small and precarious

income with great order and economy, had now much abated of these virtues,

and was unable to make his royal revenues suffice for his expenses. The

commons, without entering into too nice a disquisition, voted him four

subsidies; and this was the last time that taxes were levied in that

manner.

 

Several laws were made this session with regard to trade. The militia also

came under consideration, and some rules were established for ordering and

arming it. It was enacted, that the king should have no power of keeping

the militia under arms above fourteen days in the year. The situation of

this island, together with its great naval power, has always occasioned

other means of security, however requisite, to be much neglected among us:

and the parliament showed here a very superfluous jealousy of the king’s

strictness in disciplining the militia. The principles of liberty rather

require a contrary jealousy.

 

The earl of Bristol’s friendship with Clarendon, which had subsisted, with

great intimacy, during their exile and the distresses of the royal party,

had been considerably impaired, since the restoration, by the chancellor’s

refusing his assent to some grants which Bristol had applied for to a

court lady: and a little after, the latter nobleman, agreeably to the

impetuosity and indiscretion of his temper, broke out against the minister

in the most outrageous manner. He even entered a charge of treason against

him before the house of peers; but had concerted his measures so

imprudently, that the judges, when consulted, declared, that neither for

its matter nor its form could the charge be legally received. The articles

indeed resemble more the incoherent altercations of a passionate enemy,

than a serious accusation, fit to be discussed by a court of judicature;

and Bristol himself was so ashamed of his conduct and defeat, that he

absconded during some time. Notwithstanding his fine talents, his

eloquence, his spirit, and his courage, he could never regain the

character which he lost by this hasty and precipitate measure.

 

But though Clarendon was able to elude this rash assault, his credit at

court was sensibly declining; and in proportion as the king found himself

established on the throne, he began to alienate himself from a minister

whose character was so little suited to his own. Charles’s favor for the

Catholics was always opposed by Clarendon, public liberty was secured

against all attempts of the over-zealous royalists, prodigal grants of the

king were checked or refused, and the dignity of his own character was so

much consulted by the chancellor, that he made it an inviolable rule, as

did also his friend Southampton, never to enter into any connection with

the royal mistresses. The king’s favorite was Mrs. Palmer, afterwards

created duchess of Cleveland; a woman prodigal, rapacious, dissolute,

violent, revengeful. She failed not in her turn to undermine Clarendon’s

credit with his master; and her success was at this time made apparent to

the whole world. Secretary Nicholas, the chancellor’s great friend, was

removed from his place; and Sir Harry Bennet, his avowed enemy, was

advanced to that office. Bennet was soon after created Lord Arlington.

 

Though the king’s conduct had hitherto, since his restoration, been in the

main laudable, men of penetration began to observe, that those virtues by

which he had at first so much dazzled and enchanted the nation, had great

show, but not equal solidity. His good understanding lost much of its

influence by his want of application his bounty was more the result of a

facility of disposition than any generosity of character; his social humor

led him frequently to neglect his dignity; his love of pleasure was not

attended with proper sentiment and decency; and while he seemed to bear a

good will to every one that approached him, he had a heart not very

capable of friendship, and he had secretly entertained a very bad opinion

and distrust of mankind. But above all, what sullied his character in the

eyes of good judges, was his negligent ingratitude towards the unfortunate

cavaliers, whose zeal and sufferings in the royal cause had known no

bounds. This conduct, however, in the king may, from the circumstances of

his situation and temper, admit of some excuse; at least, of some

alleviation. As he had been restored more by the efforts of his reconciled

enemies than of his ancient friends, the former pretended a title to share

his favor; and being from practice acquainted with public business, they

were better qualified to execute any trust committed to them. The king’s

revenues were far from being large, or even equal to his necessary

expenses; and his mistresses, and the companions of his mirth and

pleasures, gained by solicitation every request from his easy temper. The

very poverty to which the more zealous royalists had reduced themselves,

by rendering them insignificant, made them unfit to support the king’s

measures, and caused him to deem them a useless encumbrance. And as many

false and ridiculous claims of merit were offered, his natural indolence,

averse to a strict discussion or inquiry, led him to treat them all with

equal indifference. The parliament took some notice of the poor cavaliers.

Sixty thousand pounds were at one time distributed among them; Mrs. Lane

also and the Penderells had handsome presents and pensions from the king.

But the greater part of the royalists still remained in poverty and

distress, aggravated by the cruel disappointment in their sanguine hopes,

and by seeing favor and preferment bestowed upon their most inveterate

foes. With regard to the act of indemnity and oblivion, they universally

said, that it was an act of indemnity to the king’s enemies and of

oblivion to his friends.
