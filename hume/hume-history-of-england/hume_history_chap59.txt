The dominion of the parliament was of short duration. No sooner had they

subdued their sovereign, than their own servants rose against them, and

tumbled them from their slippery throne. The sacred boundaries of the laws

being once violated, nothing remained to confine the wild projects of zeal

and ambition: and every successive revolution became a precedent for that

which followed it.

 

In proportion as the terror of the king’s power diminished, the division

between Independent and Presbyterian became every day more apparent; and

the neuters found it at last requisite to seek shelter in one or the other

faction. Many new writs were issued for elections, in the room of members

who had died, or were disqualified by adhering to the king; yet still the

Presbyterians retained the superiority among the commons: and all the

peers, except Lord Say, were esteemed of that party. The Independents, to

whom the inferior sectaries adhered, predominated in the army; and the

troops of the new model were universally infected with that enthusiastic

spirit. To their assistance did the Independent party among the commons

chiefly trust in their projects for acquiring the ascendant over their

antagonists.

 

Soon after the retreat of the Scots, the Presbyterians, seeing every thing

reduced to obedience, began to talk of diminishing the army; and, on

pretence of easing the public burdens, they levelled a deadly blow at the

opposite faction. They purposed to embark a strong detachment, under

Skippon and Massey, for the service of Ireland; they openly declared their

intention of making a great reduction of the remainder.[*] It was even

imagined that another new model of the army was projected, in order to

regain to the Presbyterians that superiority which they had so imprudently

lost by the former.[**]

 

The army had small inclination to the service of Ireland; a country

barbarous, uncultivated, and laid waste by massacres and civil commotions:

they had less inclination to disband, and to renounce that pay which,

having earned it through fatigues and dangers, they now purposed to enjoy

in ease and tranquillity. And most of the officers, having risen from the

dregs of the people, had no other prospect, if deprived of their

commission, than that of returning to languish in their native poverty and

obscurity.

 

These motives of interest acquired additional influence, and became more

dangerous to the parliament, from the religious spirit by which the army

was universally actuated. Among the generality of men educated in regular,

civilized societies, the sentiments of shame, duty, honor, have

considerable authority, and serve to counterbalance and direct the motives

derived from private advantage: but, by the predominancy of enthusiasm

among the parliamentary forces, these salutary principles lost their

credit, and were regarded as mere human inventions, yea, moral

institutions, fitter for heathens than for Christians.[*] The saint,

resigned over to superior guidance, was at full liberty to gratify all his

appetites, disguised under the appearance of pious zeal. And besides the

strange corruptions engendered by this spirit, it eluded and loosened all

the ties of morality, and gave entire scope, and even sanction, to the

selfishness and ambition which naturally adhere to the human mind.

 

The military confessors were further encouraged in disobedience to

superiors, by that spiritual pride to which a mistaken piety is so

subject. They were not, they said, mere janizaries; mercenary troops

enlisted for hire, and to be disposed of at the will of their

paymasters.[**] Religion and liberty were the motives which had excited

them to arms; and they had a superior right to see those blessings, which

they had purchased with their blood, insured to future generations. By the

same title that the Presbyterians, in contradistinction to the royalists,

had appropriated to themselves the epithet of godly, or the well

affected,[***] the Independents did now, in contradistinction to the

Presbyterians, assume this magnificent appellation, and arrogate all the

ascendant which naturally belongs to it.

 

Hearing of parties in the house of commons, and being informed that the

minority were friends to the army, the majority enemies, the troops

naturally interested themselves in that dangerous distinction, and were

eager to give the superiority to their partisans. Whatever hardships they

underwent, though perhaps derived from inevitable necessity, were ascribed

to a settled design of oppressing them, and resented as an effect of the

animosity and malice of their adversaries.

 

Notwithstanding the great revenue which accrued from taxes, assessments,

sequestrations, and compositions, considerable arrears were due to the

army; and many of the private men, as well as officers, had near a

twelvemonth’s pay still owing them. The army suspected that this

deficiency was purposely contrived in order to oblige them to live at free

quarters; and, by rendering them odious to the country, serve as a

pretence for disbanding them. When they saw such members as were employed

in committees and civil offices accumulate fortunes, they accused them of

rapine and public plunder. And as no plan was pointed out by the commons

for the payment of arrears, the soldiers dreaded, that after they should

be disbanded or embarked for Ireland, their enemies, who predominated in

the two houses, would entirely defraud them of their right, and oppress

them with impunity.

 

On this ground or pretence did the first commotions begin in the army. A

petition, addressed to Fairfax, the general, was handed about, craving an

indemnity, and that ratified by the king, for any illegal actions of

which, during the course of the war, the soldiers might have been guilty;

together with satisfaction in arrears, freedom from pressing, relief of

widows and maimed soldiers, and pay till disbanded.[*] The commons, aware

of what combustible materials the army was composed, were alarmed at this

intelligence. Such a combination, they knew, if not checked in its first

appearance, must be attended with the most dangerous consequences, and

must soon exalt the military above the civil authority. Besides summoning

some officers to answer for this attempt, they immediately voted, that the

petition tended to introduce mutiny, to put conditions upon the

parliament, and to obstruct the relief of Ireland; and they threatened to

proceed against the promoters of it as enemies to the state, and

disturbers of public peace.[**]

 

This declaration, which may be deemed violent, especially as the army had

some ground for complaint, produced fatal effects. The soldiers lamented,

that they were deprived of the privileges of Englishmen; that they were

not allowed so much as to represent their grievances; that, while

petitions from Essex and other places were openly encouraged against the

army, their mouths were stopped; and that they, who were the authors of

liberty to the nation, were reduced, by a faction in parliament, to the

most grievous servitude.

 

In this disposition was the army found by Warwick, Dacres, Massey, and

other commissioners, who were sent to make them proposals for entering

into the service of Ireland.[*] instead of enlisting, the generality

objected to the terms; demanded an indemnity; were clamorous for their

arrears; and, though they expressed no dissatisfaction against Skippon,

who was appointed commander, they discovered much stronger inclination to

serve under Fairfax and Cromwell.[**] Some officers, who were of the

Presbyterian party, having entered into engagements for this service,

could prevail on very few of the soldiers to enlist under them. And, as

these officers lay all under the grievous reproach of deserting the army,

and betraying the interests of their companions, the rest were further

confirmed in that confederacy which they had secretly formed.[***]

 

To petition and remonstrate being the most cautious method of conducting a

confederacy, an application to parliament was signed by near two hundred

officers, in which they made their apology with a very imperious air,

asserted their right of petitioning, and complained of that imputation

thrown upon them by the former declaration of the lower house.[****] The

private men, likewise, of some regiments sent a letter to Skippon, in

which, together with insisting on the same topics, they lament that

designs were formed against them and many of the godly party in the

kingdom; and declare that they could not engage for Ireland, till they

were satisfied in their expectations, and had their just desires

granted.[v] The army, in a word, felt their power, and resolved to be

masters.

 

The parliament, too, resolved, if possible, to preserve their dominion;

but being destitute of power; and not retaining much authority, it was not

easy for them to employ any expedient which could contribute to their

purpose. The expedient which they now made use of was the worst

imaginable. They sent Skippon, Cromwell, Ireton, and Fleetwood, to the

head quarters at Saffron Weldon, in Essex, and empowered them to make

offers to the army, and inquire into the cause of its distempers. These

very generals, at least the three last, were secretly the authors of all

the discontents; and failed not to foment those disorders which they

pretended to appease. By their suggestion, a measure was embraced which at

once brought matters to extremity, and rendered the mutiny incurable.

 

In opposition to the parliament at Westminster, a military parliament was

formed. Together with a council of the principal officers, which was

appointed after the model of the house of peers, a more free

representative of the army was composed, by the election of two private

men or inferior officers, under the title of agitators, from each troop or

company.[*] By this means, both the general humor of that time was

gratified, intent on plans of imaginary republics; and an easy method

contrived for conducting, underhand, and propagating the sedition of the

army.

 

This terrible court, when assembled, having first declared that they found

no distempers in the army, but many grievances under which it labored,

immediately voted the offers of the parliament unsatisfactory. Eight

weeks’ pay alone, they said, was promised; a small part of fifty-six

weeks, which they claimed as their due: no visible security was given for

the remainder: and having been declared public enemies by the commons,

they might hereafter be prosecuted as such, unless the declaration were

recalled.[**] Before matters came to this height, Cromwell had posted up

to London, on pretence of laying before the parliament the rising

discontents of the army.

 

The parliament made one vigorous effort more, to try the force of their

authority: they voted, that all the troops which did not engage for

Ireland, should instantly be disbanded in their quarters.[***]

 

At the same time, the council of the army ordered a general rendezvous of

all the regiments, in order to provide for their common interests. And

while they thus prepared themselves for opposition to the parliament, they

struck a blow which at once decided the victory in their favor.

 

A party of five hundred horse appeared at Holdenby, conducted by one

Joyce, who had once been a tailor by profession, but was now advanced to

the rank of cornet, and was an active agitator in the army. Without being

opposed by the guard, whose affections were all on their side, Joyce came

into the king’s presence, armed with pistols, and told him, that he must

immediately go along with him. “Whither?” said the king. “To the army,”

replied Joyce. “By what warrant?” asked the king. Joyce pointed to the

soldiers whom he brought along; tall, handsome, and well accoutred. “Your

warrant,” said Charles, smiling, “is writ in fair characters, legible

without spelling.”[*] The parliamentary commissioners came into the room:

they asked Joyce whether he had any orders from the parliament? he said,

“No;” from the general? “No;” by what authority he came? he made the same

reply as to the king. “They would write,” they said, “to the parliament to

know their pleasure.” “You may do so,” replied Joyce; “but in the mean

time, the king must immediately go with me.” Resistance was vain. The

king, after protracting the time as long as he could, went into his coach

and was safely conducted to the army, who were hastening to their

rendezvous at Triplo Heath, near Cambridge. The parliament, informed of

this event by their commissioners, were thrown into the utmost

consternation.[**]

 

Fairfax himself was no less surprised at the king’s arrival. That bold

measure, executed by Joyce, had never been communicated to the general.

The orders were entirely verbal, and nobody avowed them. And while every

one affected astonishment at the enterprise, Cromwell, by whose counsel it

had been directed, arrived from London, and put an end to their

deliberations.

 

This artful and audacious conspirator had conducted himself in the

parliament with such profound dissimulation, with such refined hypocrisy,

that he had long deceived those who, being themselves very dexterous

practitioners in the same arts, should naturally have entertained the more

suspicion against others. At every intelligence of disorders in the army,

he was moved to the highest pitch of grief and of anger. He wept bitterly:

he lamented the misfortunes of his country: he advised every violent

measure for suppressing the mutiny; and by these precipitate counsels at

once seemed to evince his own sincerity, and inflamed those discontents of

which he intended to make advantage. He obtested heaven and earth, that

his devoted attachment to the parliament had rendered him so odious in the

army, that his life, while among them, was in the utmost danger; and he

had very narrowly escaped a conspiracy formed to assassinate him. But

information being brought that the most active officers and agitators were

entirely his creatures, the parliamentary leaders secretly resolved, that,

next day, when he should come to the house, an accusation should be

entered against him, and he should be sent to the Tower.[*] Cromwell, who,

in the conduct of his desperate enterprises, frequently approached to the

very brink of destruction, knew how to make the requisite turn with proper

dexterity and boldness. Being informed of this design, he hastened to the

camp; where he was received with acclamations, and was instantly invested

with the supreme command both of general and army.

 

Fairfax, having neither talents himself for cabal, nor penetration to

discover the cabals of others, had given his entire confidence to

Cromwell; who, by the best colored pretences, and by the appearance of an

open sincerity and a scrupulous conscience, imposed on the easy nature of

this brave and virtuous man. The council of officers and the agitators

were moved altogether by Cromwell’s direction, and conveyed his will to

the whole army. By his profound and artful conduct, he had now attained a

situation where he could cover his enterprises from public view; and

seeming either to obey the commands of his superior officer, or yield to

the movements of the soldiers, could secretly pave the way for his future

greatness. While the disorders of the army were yet in their infancy, he

kept at a distance, lest his counterfeit aversion might throw a damp upon

them, or his secret encouragement beget suspicion in the parliament. As

soon as they came to maturity, he openly joined the troops; and, in the

critical moment, struck that important blow of seizing the king’s person,

and depriving the parliament of any resource of an accommodation with him.

Though one visor fell off another still remained to cover his natural

countenance.

 

Where delay was requisite, he could employ the most indefatigable

patience: where celerity was necessary, he flew to a decision. And by thus

uniting in his person the most opposite talents, he was enabled to combine

the most contrary interests in a subserviency to his secret purposes.

 

The parliament, though at present defenceless, was possessed of many

resources; and time might easily enable them to resist that violence with

which they were threatened. Without further deliberation, therefore,

Cromwell advanced the army upon them, and arrived in a few days at St.

Albans.

 

Nothing could be more popular than this hostility which the army commenced

against the parliament. As much as that assembly was once the idol of the

nation, as much was it now become the object of general hatred and

aversion.

 

The self-denying ordinance had no longer been put in execution, than till

Essex, Manchester, Waller, and the other officers of that party, had

resigned their commission: immediately after, it was laid aside by tacit

consent; and the members, sharing all offices of power and profit among

them, proceeded with impunity in exercising acts of oppression on the

helpless nation. Though the necessity of their situation might serve as an

apology for many of their measures, the people, not accustomed to such a

species of government, were not disposed to make the requisite allowances.

 

A small supply of one hundred thousand pounds a year could never be

obtained by former kings from the jealous humor of parliaments; and the

English, of all nations in Europe, were the least accustomed to taxes; but

this parliament, from the commencement of the war, according to some

computations, had levied, in five years, above forty millions;[*] yet were

loaded with debts and incumbrances, which, during that age, were regarded

as prodigious. If these computations should be thought much exaggerated,

as they probably are,[**] the taxes and impositions were certainly far

higher than in any former state of the English government; and such

popular exaggerations are at least a proof of popular discontents.

 

But the disposal of this money was no less the object of general complaint

against the parliament than the levying of it. The sum of three hundred

thousand pounds they openly took, it is affirmed,[*] and divided among

their own members. The committees, to whom the management of the different

branches of revenue was intrusted, never brought in their accounts, and

had unlimited power of secreting whatever sums they pleased from the

public treasure.[**] These branches were needlessly multiplied, in order

to render the revenue more intricate, to share the advantages among

greater numbers, and to conceal the frauds of which they were universally

suspected.[***]

 

The method of keeping accounts practised in the exchequer, was confessedly

the exactest, the most ancient, the best known, and the least liable to

fraud. The exchequer was for that reason abolished, and the revenue put

under the management of a committee, who were subject to no control.[****]

 

The excise was an odious tax, formerly unknown to the nation; and was now

extended over provisions, and the common necessaries of life. Near one

half of the goods and chattels, and at least one half of the lands, rents,

and revenues of the kingdom, had been sequestered. To great numbers of

loyalists, all redress from these sequestrations was refused: to the rest,

the remedy could be obtained only by paying large compositions, and

subscribing the covenant, which they abhorred. Besides pitying the ruin

and desolation of so many ancient and honorable families, indifferent

spectators could not but blame the hardship of punishing with such

severity actions which the law, in its usual and most undisputed

interpretation, strictly required of every subject.

 

The severities, too, exercised against the Episcopal clergy naturally

affected the royalists, and even all men of candor, in a sensible manner.

By the most moderate computation,[v] it appears, that above one half of

the established clergy had been turned out to beggary and want, for no

other crime than their adhering to the civil and religious principles in

which they had been educated, and for their attachment to those laws under

whose countenance they had at first embraced that profession.

 

To renounce Episcopacy and the liturgy, and to subscribe the covenant,

were the only terms which could save them from so rigorous a fate; and if

the least mark of malignancy, as it was called, or affection to the king,

who so entirely loved them, had ever escaped their lips, even this hard

choice was not permitted. The sacred character, which gives the priesthood

such authority over mankind, becoming more venerable from the sufferings

endured for the sake of principle by these distressed royalists,

aggravated the general indignation against their persecutors.

 

But what excited the most universal complaint was, the unlimited tyranny

and despotic rule of the country committees. During the war, the

discretionary power of these courts was excused, from the plea of

necessity; but the nation was reduced to despair, when it saw neither end

put to their duration, nor bounds to their authority. These could

sequester, fine, imprison, and corporally punish, without law or remedy.

They interposed in questions of private property. Under color of

malignancy, they exercised vengeance against their private enemies. To the

obnoxious, and sometimes to the innocent, they sold their protection. And

instead of one star chamber, which had been abolished, a great number were

anew erected, fortified with better pretences, and armed with more

unlimited authority.[*]

 

Could any thing have increased the indignation against that slavery into

which the nation, from the too eager pursuit of liberty, had fallen, it

must have been the reflection on the pretences by which the people had so

long been deluded. The sanctified hypocrites, who called their oppressions

the spoiling of the Egyptians, and their rigid severity the dominion of

the elect, interlarded all their iniquities with long and fervent prayers,

saved themselves from blushing by their pious grimaces, and exercised, in

the name of the Lord, all their cruelty on men. An undisguised violence

could be forgiven: but such a mockery of the understanding, such an abuse

of religion, were, with men of penetration, objects of peculiar

resentment.

 

The parliament, conscious of their decay in popularity, seeing a

formidable armed force advance upon them, were reduced to despair, and

found all their resources much inferior to the present necessity. London

still retained a strong attachment to Presbyterianism; and its militia,

which was numerous, and had acquired reputation in the wars, had, by a

late ordinance, been put into hands in whom the parliament could entirely

confide. This militia was now called out, and ordered to guard the lines

which had been drawn round the city, in order to secure it against the

king. A body of horse was ordered to be instantly levied. Many officers,

who had been cashiered by the new model of the army, offered their service

to the parliament. An army of five thousand men lay in the north under the

command of General Pointz, who was of the Presbyterian faction; but these

were too distant to be employed in so urgent a necessity. The forces

destined for Ireland were quartered in the west; and, though deemed

faithful to the parliament, they also lay at a distance. Many inland

garrisons were commanded by officer: of the same party; but their troops,

being so much dispersed, could at present be of no manner of service. The

Scots were faithful friends, and zealous for Presbytery and the covenant;

but a long time was required ere they could collect their forces and march

to the assistance of the parliament.

 

In this situation it was thought more prudent to submit, and by compliance

to stop the fury of the enraged army. The declaration by which the

military petitioners had been voted public enemies was recalled, and

erased from the journal book.[*] This was the first symptom which the

parliament gave of submission; and the army, hoping by terror alone to

effect all their purposes, stopped at St. Albans, and entered into

negotiation with their masters.

 

Here commenced the encroachments of the military upon the civil authority.

The army, in their usurpations on the parliament, copied exactly the model

which the parliament itself had set them in their recent usurpations on

the crown.

 

Every day they rose in their demands. If one claim was granted, they had

another ready, still more enormous and exorbitant; and were determined

never to be satisfied. At first, they pretended only to petition for what

concerned themselves as soldiers: next, they must have a vindication of

their character: then, it was necessary that their enemies be punished:[*]

at last, they claimed a right of modelling the whole government, and

settling the nation.[**]

 

They preserved, in words, all deference and respect to the parliament;

but, in reality, insulted them and tyrannized over them. That assembly

they pretended not to accuse: it was only evil counsellors, who seduced

and betrayed it.

 

They proceeded so far as to name eleven members, whom, in general terms,

they charged with high treason, as enemies to the army and evil

counsellors to the parliament. Their names were Hollis, Sir Philip

Stapleton, Sir William Lewis, Sir John Clotworthy, Sir William Waller, Sir

John Maynard, Massey, Glyn, Long, Harley, and Nichols.[***] These were the

very leaders of the Presbyterian party.

 

They insisted, that these members should immediately be sequestered from

parliament, and be thrown into prison.[****] The commons replied, that

they could not, upon a general charge, proceed so far.[v] The army

observed to them, that the cases of Strafford and Laud were direct

precedents for that purpose.[v*] At last, the eleven members themselves,

not to give occasion for discord, begged leave to retire from the house;

and the army, for the present, seemed satisfied with this mark of

submission.[v**]

 

Pretending that the parliament intended to levy war upon them, and to

involve the nation again in blood and confusion, they required that all

new levies should be stopped. The parliament complied with this

demand.[v***]

 

There being no signs of resistance, the army, in order to save

appearances, removed, at the desire of the parliament to a greater

distance from London, and fixed their head quarters at Reading. They

carried the king along with them in all their marches.

 

That prince now found himself in a better situation than at Holdenby, and

had attained some greater degree of freedom as well as of consideration

with both parties.

 

All his friends had access to his presence: his correspondence with the

queen was not interrupted: his chaplains were restored to him, and he was

allowed the use of the liturgy. His children were once allowed to visit

him, and they passed a few days at Caversham, where he then resided.[*] He

had not seen the duke of Gloucester, his youngest son, and the princess

Elizabeth, since he left London, at the commencement of the civil

disorders;[**] nor the duke of York, since he went to the Scottish army

before Newark. No private man, unacquainted with the pleasures of a court

and the tumult of a camp, more passionately loved his family, than did

this good prince; and such an instance of indulgence in the army was

extremely grateful to him. Cromwell, who was witness to the meeting of the

royal family, confessed that he never had been present at so tender a

scene; and he extremely applauded the benignity which displayed itself in

the whole disposition and behavior of Charles.

 

That artful politician, as well as the leaders of all parties, paid court

to the king; and fortune, notwithstanding all his calamities, seemed again

to smile upon him. The parliament, afraid of his forming some

accommodation with the army, addressed him in a more respectful style than

formerly; and invited him to reside at Richmond, and contribute his

assistance to the settlement of the nation. The chief officers treated him

with regard, and spake on all occasions of restoring him to his just

powers and prerogatives. In the public declarations of the army, the

settlement of his revenue and authority was insisted on.[***] The

royalists every where entertained hopes of the restoration of monarchy;

and the favor which they universally bore to the army, contributed very

much to discourage the parliament, and to forward their submission.

 

The king began to feel of what consequence he was. The more the national

confusions increased, the more was he confident that all parties would at

length have recourse to his lawful authority, as the only remedy for the

public disorders “You cannot be without me,” said he, on several

occasions: “you cannot settle the nation but by my assistance.” A people

without government and without liberty, a parliament without authority, an

army without a legal master; distractions every where, terrors,

oppressions, convulsions: from this scene of confusion, which could not

long continue, all men, he hoped, would be brought to reflect on that

ancient government under which they and their ancestors had so long

enjoyed happiness and tranquillity.

 

Though Charles kept his ears open to all proposals, and expected to hold

the balance between the opposite parties, he entertained more hopes of

accommodation with the army. He had experienced the extreme rigor of the

parliament. They pretended totally to annihilate his authority: they had

confined his person. In both these particulars, the army showed more

indulgence.[*] He had a free intercourse with his friends. And, in the

proposals which the council of officers sent for the settlement of the

nation, they insisted neither on the abolition of Episcopacy, nor on the

punishment of the royalists; the two points to which the king had the most

extreme reluctance: and they demanded, that a period should be put to the

present parliament, the event for which he most ardently longed.

 

His conjunction, too, seemed more natural with the generals, than with

that usurping assembly who had so long assumed the entire sovereignty of

the state, and who had declared their resolution still to continue

masters. By gratifying a few persons with titles and preferments, he might

draw over, he hoped, the whole military power, and in an instant reinstate

himself in his civil authority. To Ireton he offered the lieutenancy of

Ireland; to Cromwell the garter, the title of earl of Essex, and the

command of the army. Negotiations to this purpose were secretly conducted.

Cromwell pretended to hearken to them and was well pleased to keep the

door open for an accommodation, if the course of events should at any time

render it necessary. And the king, who had no suspicion that one born a

private gentleman could entertain the daring ambition of seizing a

sceptre, transmitted through a long line of monarchs, indulged hopes that

he would at last embrace a measure which, by all the motives of duty,

interest, and safety, seemed to be recommended to him.

 

While Cromwell allured the king by these expectations, he still continued

his scheme of reducing the parliament to subjection, and depriving them of

all means of resistance. To gratify the army, the parliament invested

Fairfax with the title of general-in-chief of all the forces in England

and Ireland; and intrusted the whole military authority to a person who,

though well inclined to their service, was no longer at his own disposal.

 

They voted, that the troops which, in obedience to them had enlisted for

Ireland, and deserted the rebellious army, should be disbanded, or, in

other words, be punished for their fidelity. The forces in the north,

under Pointz, had already mutinied against their general, and had entered

into an association with that body of the army which was so successfully

employed in exalting the military above the civil authority.[*]

 

That no resource might remain to the parliament, it was demanded, that the

militia of London should be changed, the Presbyterian commissioners

displaced, and the command restored to those who, during the course of the

war, had constantly exercised it. The parliament even complied with so

violent a demand, and passed a vote in obedience to the army.[**]

 

By this unlimited patience, they purposed to temporize under their present

difficulties, and they hoped to find a more favorable opportunity for

recovering their authority and influence: but the impatience of the city

lost them all the advantage of their cautious measures. A petition against

the alteration of the militia was carried to Westminster, attended by the

apprentices and seditious multitude, who besieged the door of the house of

commons; and by their clamor, noise, and violence, obliged them to reverse

that vote which they had passed so lately. When gratified in this

pretension, they immediately dispersed, and left the parliament at

liberty.[***]

 

No sooner was intelligence of this tumult conveyed to Reading, than the

army was put in motion. The two houses being under restraint, they were

resolved, they said, to vindicate, against the seditious citizens, the

invaded privileges of parliament, and restore that assembly to its just

freedom of debate and counsel. In their way to London, they were drawn up

on Hounslow Heath; a formidable body, twenty thousand strong, and

determined, without regard to laws or liberty, to pursue whatever measures

their generals should dictate to them. Here the most favorable event

happened to quicken and encourage their advance. The speakers of the two

houses, Manchester and Lenthal, attended by eight peers and about sixty

commoners, having secretly retired from the city, presented themselves

with their maces, and all the ensigns of their dignity; and complaining of

the violence put upon them, applied to the army for defence and

protection. They were received with shouts and acclamations: respect was

paid to them, as to the parliament of England: and the army, being

provided with so plausible a pretence, which in all public transactions is

of great consequence, advanced to chastise the rebellious city, and to

reinstate the violated parliament.[*]

 

Neither Lenthal nor Manchester were esteemed Independents; and such a step

in them was unexpected. But they probably foresaw that the army must in

the end prevail; and they were willing to pay court in time to that

authority which began to predominate in the nation.

 

The parliament, forced from their temporizing measures, and obliged to

resign at once, or combat for their liberty and power, prepared themselves

with vigor for defence, and determined to resist the violence of the army.

The two houses immediately chose new speakers, Lord Hunsdon and Henry

Pelham: they renewed their former orders for enlisting troops: they

appointed Massey to be commander: they ordered the trained bands to man

the lines: and the whole city was in a ferment, and resounded with

military preparations.[**]

 

When any intelligence arrived, that the army stopped or retreated, the

shout of “One and all.” ran with alacrity, from street to street, among

the citizens: when news came of their advancing, the cry of “Treat and

capitulate,” was no less loud and vehement.[***] The terror of a universal

pillage, and even massacre, had seized the timid inhabitants.

 

As the army approached, Rainsborow, being sent by the general over the

river, presented himself before Southwark, and was gladly received by some

soldiers who were quartered there for its defence, and who were resolved

not to separate their interests from those of the army. It behoved then

the parliament to submit. The army marched in triumph through the city;

but preserved the greatest order, decency, and appearance of humility.

They conducted to Westminster the two speakers, who took their seats as if

nothing had happened. The eleven impeached members, being accused as

authors of the tumult, were expelled; and most of them retired beyond sea:

seven peers were impeached; the mayor, one sheriff, and three aldermen,

sent to the Tower, several citizens and officers of the militia committed

to prison; every deed of the parliament annulled, from the day of the

tumult till the return of the speakers; the lines about the city levelled;

the militia restored to the Independents; regiments quartered in Whitehall

and the Mews; and the parliament being reduced to a regular formed

servitude, a day was appointed of solemn thanksgiving for the restoration

of its liberty.[*]

 

The Independent party among the commons exulted in their victory. The

whole authority of the nation, they imagined, was now lodged in their

hands; and they had a near prospect of moulding the government into that

imaginary republic which had long been the object of their wishes. They

had secretly concurred in all encroachments of the military upon the civil

power; and they expected, by the terror of the sword, to impose a more

perfect system of liberty on the reluctant nation. All parties, the king,

the church, the parliament, the Presbyterians, had been guilty of errors

since the commencement of these disorders: but it must be confessed, that

this delusion of the Independents and republicans was, of all others, the

most contrary to common sense and the established maxims of policy. Yet

were the leaders of that party, Vane, Fiennes, St. John, Martin, the men

in England the most celebrated for profound thought and deep contrivance;

and by their well-colored pretences and professions, they had overreached

the whole nation. To deceive such men, would argue a superlative capacity

in Cromwell; were it not that besides the great difference there is

between dark, crooked counsels and true wisdom, an exorbitant passion for

rule and authority will make the most prudent overlook the dangerous

consequences of such measures as seem to tend, in any degree, to their own

advancement.

 

The leaders of the army, having established their dominion over the

parliament and city, ventured to bring the king to Hampton Court; and he

lived for some time in that palace, with an appearance of dignity and

freedom. Such equability of temper did he possess, that, during all the

variety of fortune which he underwent, no difference was perceived in his

countenance or behavior; and though a prisoner in the hands of his most

inveterate enemies, he supported, towards all who approached him, the

majesty of a monarch; and that neither with less nor greater state than he

had been accustomed to maintain. His manner, which was not in itself

popular nor gracious, now appeared amiable, from its great meekness and

equality.

 

The parliament renewed their applications to him, and presented him with

the same conditions which they had offered at Newcastle. The king declined

accepting them, and desired the parliament to take the proposals of the

army into consideration, and make them the foundation of the public

sentiment.[*] He still entertained hopes that his negotiations with the

generals would be crowned with success; though every thing, in that

particular, daily bore a worse aspect. Most historians have thought that

Cromwell never was sincere in his professions; and that having by force

rendered himself master of the king’s person, and by fair pretences

acquired the countenance of the royalists, he had employed these

advantages to the enslaving of the parliament; and afterwards thought of

nothing but the establishment of his own unlimited authority, with which

he esteemed the restoration, and even life, of the king altogether

incompatible. This opinion, so much warranted by the boundless ambition

and profound dissimulation of his character, meets with ready belief;

though it is more agreeable to the narrowness of human views, and the

darkness of futurity, to suppose that this daring usurper was guided by

events, and did not as yet foresee, with any assurance, that unparalleled

greatness which he afterwards attained. Many writers of that age have

asserted,[**] 17that he really intended to make a private

bargain with the king; a measure which carried the most plausible

appearance both for his safety and advancement; but that he found

insuperable difficulties in reconciling to it the wild humors of the army.

 

The horror and antipathy of these fanatics had for many years been

artfully fomented against Charles; and though their principles were, on

all occasions, easily warped and eluded by private interest, yet was some

coloring requisite, and a flat contradiction to all former professions and

tenets could not safely be proposed to them. It is certain, at least, that

Cromwell made use of this reason why he admitted rarely of visits from the

king’s friends, and showed less favor than formerly to the royal cause.

The agitators, he said, had rendered him odious to the army, and had

represented him as a traitor, who, for the sake of private interest, was

ready to betray the cause of God to the great enemy of piety and religion.

Desperate projects, too, he asserted to be secretly formed for the murder

of the king; and he pretended much to dread lest all his authority, and

that of the commanding officers, would not be able to restrain these

enthusiasts from their bloody purposes.[*]

 

Intelligence being daily brought to the king of menaces thrown out by the

agitators, he began to think of retiring from Hampton Court, and of

putting himself in some place of safety. The guards were doubled upon him;

the promiscuous concourse of people restrained; a more jealous care

exerted in attending his person; all under color of protecting him from

danger, but really with a view of making him uneasy in his present

situation. These artifices soon produced the intended effect. Charles, who

was naturally apt to be swayed by counsel, and who had not then access to

any good counsel, took suddenly a resolution of withdrawing himself,

though without any concerted, at least, any rational scheme for the future

disposal of his person. Attended only by Sir John Berkeley, Ashburnham,

and Leg, he privately left Hampton court; and his escape was not

discovered till near an hour after; when those who entered his chamber,

found on the table some letters directed to the parliament, to the

general, and to the officer who had attended him.[**]

 

All night he travelled through the forest, and arrived next day at

Tichfield, a seat of the earl of Southampton’s, where the countess dowager

resided, a woman of honor, to whom the king knew he might safely intrust

his person. Before he arrived at this place, he had gone to the sea-coast;

and expressed great anxiety that a ship which he seemed to look for, had

not arrived; and thence, Berkeley and Leg, who were not in the secret,

conjectured that his intention was to transport himself beyond sea.

 

The king could not hope to remain long concealed at Tichfield: what

measure should next be embraced, was the question. In the neighborhood lay

the Isle of Wight, of which Hammond was governor. This man was entirely

dependent on Cromwell. At his recommendation, he had married a daughter of

the famous Hambden, who during his lifetime had been an intimate friend of

Cromwell’s, and whose memory was ever respected by him. These

circumstances were very unfavorable: yet, because the governor was nephew

to Dr. Hammond, the king’s favorite chaplain, and had acquired a good

character in the army, it was thought proper to have recourse to him in

the present exigence, when no other rational expedient could be thought

of. Ashburnham and Berkeley were despatched to the island. They had orders

not to inform Hammond of the place where the king was concealed, till they

had first obtained a promise from him not to deliver up his majesty,

though the parliament and the army should require him; but to restore him

to his liberty, if he could not protect him. This promise, it is evident,

would have been a very slender security: yet, even without exacting it,

Ashburnham imprudently, if not treacherously, brought Hammond to

Tichfield; and the king was obliged to put himself in his hands, and to

attend him to Carisbroke Castle, in the Isle of Wight where, though

received with great demonstrations of respect and duty, he was in reality

a prisoner.

Lord Clarendon[*] is positive, that the king, when he fled from Hampton

Court, had no intention of going to this island; and indeed all the

circumstances of that historian’s narrative, which we have here followed,

strongly favor this opinion. But there remains a letter of Charles’s to

the earl of Laneric, secretary of Scotland, in which he plainly intimates,

that that measure was voluntarily embraced: and even insinuates, that if

he had thought proper, he might have been in Jersey, or any other place of

safety.[**] 18
 

Perhaps he still confided in the promises of the generals; and flattered

himself, that if he were removed from the fury of the agitators, by which

his life was immediately threatened, they would execute what they had so

often promised in his favor.

 

Whatever may be the truth in this matter,—for it is impossible fully

to ascertain the truth,—Charles never took a weaker step, nor one

more agreeable to Cromwell and all his enemies. He was now lodged in a

place removed from his partisans, at the disposal of the army, whence it

would be very difficult to deliver him, either by force or artifice. And

though it was always in the power of Cromwell, whenever he pleased, to

have sent him thither, yet such a measure, without the king’s consent,

would have been very invidious, if not attended with some danger. That the

king should voluntarily throw himself into the snare, and thereby gratify

his implacable persecutors, was to them an incident peculiarly fortunate,

and proved in the issue very fatal to him.

 

Cromwell, being now entirely master of the parliament and free from all

anxiety with regard to the custody of the king’s person, applied himself

seriously to quell those disorders in the army, which he himself had so

artfully raised, and so successfully employed, against both king and

parliament. In order to engage the troops into a rebellion against their

masters, he had encouraged an arrogant spirit among the inferior officers

and private men; and the camp, in many respects, carried more the

appearance of civil liberty than of military obedience. The troops

themselves were formed into a kind of republic; and the plans of imaginary

republics, for the settlement of the state, were every day the topics of

conversation among these armed legislators. Royalty it was agreed to

abolish: nobility must be set aside: even all ranks of men be levelled;

and a universal equality of property, as well as of power, be introduced

among the citizens. The saints, they said, were the salt of the earth: an

entire parity had place among the elect; and by the same rule that the

apostles were exalted from the most ignoble professions, the meanest

sentinel, if enlightened by the Spirit, was entitled to equal regard with

the greatest commander. In order to wean the soldiers from these,

licentious maxims, Cromwell had issued orders for discontinuing the

meetings of the agitators; and he pretended to pay entire obedience to the

parliament, whom being now fully reduced to subjection, he purposed to

make for the future, the instruments of his authority. But the

“levellers,”—for so that party in the army was called,—having

experienced the sweets of dominion, would not so easily be deprived of it.

They secretly continued their meetings: they asserted, that their

officers, as much as any part of the church or state, needed reformation:

several regiments joined in seditious remonstrances and petitions:[*]

separate rendezvouses were concerted; and every thing tended to anarchy

and confusion. But this distemper was soon cured by the rough but

dexterous hand of Cromwell. He chose the opportunity of a review, that he

might display the greater boldness, and spread the terror the wider. He

seized the ringleaders before their companions; held in the field a

council of war; shot one mutineer instantly; and struck such dread into

the rest, that they presently threw down the symbols of sedition, which

they had displayed, and thenceforth returned to their wonted discipline

and obedience.[**]

 

Cromwell had great deference for the counsels of Ireton, a man who, having

grafted the soldier on the lawyer the statesman on the saint, had adopted

such principles as were fitted to introduce the severest tyranny, while

they seemed to encourage the most unbounded license in human society.

Fierce in his nature, though probably sincere in his intentions, he

purposed by arbitrary power to establish liberty, and, in prosecution of

his imagined religious purposes, he thought himself dispensed from all the

ordinary rules of morality, by which inferior mortals must allow

themselves to be governed. From his suggestion, Cromwell secretly called

at Windsor a council of the chief officers, in order to deliberate

concerning the settlement of the nation, and the future disposal of the

king’s person.[***]

 

In this conference, which commenced with devout prayers, poured forth by

Cromwell himself and other inspired persons, (for the officers of this

army received inspiration with their commission,) was first opened the

daring and unheard-of counsel, of bringing the king to justice, and of

punishing, by a judicial sentence, their sovereign, for his pretended

tyranny and maleadministration. While Charles lived, even though

restrained to the closest prison, conspiracies, they knew, and

insurrections would never be wanting in favor of a prince who was so

extremely revered and beloved by his own party, and whom the nation in

general began to regard with great affection and compassion. To murder him

privately was exposed to the imputation of injustice and cruelty,

aggravated by the baseness of such a crime; and every odious epithet of

“traitor” and “assassin” would, by the general voice of mankind, be

indisputably ascribed to the actors in such a villany. Some unexpected

procedure must be attempted, which would astonish the world by its

novelty, would bear the semblance of justice, and would cover its

barbarity by the audaciousness of the enterprise. Striking in with the

fanatical notions of the entire equality of mankind, it would insure the

devoted obedience of the army, and serve as a general engagement against

the royal family, whom, by their open and united deed, they would so

heinously affront and injure.[*]

 

This measure, therefore, being secretly resolved on, it was requisite, by

degrees, to make the parliament adopt it, and to conduct them from

violence to violence, till this last act of atrocious iniquity should seem

in a manner wholly inevitable. The king, in order to remove those fears

and jealousies, which were perpetually pleaded as reasons for every

invasion of the constitution, had offered, by a message sent from

Carisbroke Castle, to resign, during his own life, the power of the

militia and the nomination to all the great offices; provided that, after

his demise, these prerogatives should revert to the crown.[**] But the

parliament acted entirely as victors and enemies; and, in all their

transactions with him, paid no longer any regard to equity or reason. At

the instigation of the Independents and army, they neglected this offer,

and framed four proposals, which they sent him as preliminaries; and

before they would deign to treat, they demanded his positive assent to all

of them.

 

By one, he was required to invest the parliament with the military power

for twenty years, together with an authority to levy whatever money should

be necessary for exercising it; and even after the twenty years should be

elapsed, they reserved a right of resuming the same authority, whenever

they should declare the safety of the kingdom to require it. By the

second, he was to recall all his proclamations and declarations against

the parliament, and acknowledge that assembly to have taken arms in their

just and necessary defence. By the third, he was to annul all the acts,

and void all the patents of peerage, which had passed the great seal since

it had been carried from London by Lord Keeper Littleton; and at the same

time, renounce for the future the power of making peers without consent of

parliament. By the fourth, he gave the two houses power to adjourn as they

thought proper; a demand seemingly of no great importance, but contrived

by the Independents, that they might be able to remove the parliament to

places where it should remain in perpetual subjection to the army.[*]

 

1648.

 

The king regarded the pretension as unusual and exorbitant, that he should

make such concessions, while not secure of any settlement; and should

blindly trust his enemies for the conditions which they were afterwards to

grant him. He required, therefore, a personal treaty with the parliament,

and desired that all the terms on both sides should be adjusted, before

any concession on either side should be insisted on. The republican party

in the house pretended to take fire at this answer; and openly inveighed,

in violent terms, against the person and government of the king; whose

name, hitherto, had commonly, in all debates, been mentioned with some

degree of reverence. Ireton, seeming to speak the sense of the army, under

the appellation of many thousand godly men, who had ventured their lives

in defence of the parliament, said, that the king, by denying the four

bills, had refused safety and protection to his people; that their

obedience to him was but a reciprocal duty for his protection of them; and

that, as he had failed on his part, they were freed from all obligations

to allegiance, and must settle the nation, without consulting any longer

so misguided a prince.[**]

 

Cromwell, after giving an ample character of the valor, good affections,

and godliness of the army, subjoined, that it was expected the parliament

should guide and defend the kingdom by their own power and resolutions,

and not accustom the people any longer to expect safety and government

from an obstinate man, whose heart God had hardened; that those who, at

the expense of their blood, had hitherto defended the parliament from so

many dangers, would still continue, with fidelity and courage, to protect

them against all opposition in this vigorous measure. “Teach them not,”

added he, “by your neglecting your own safety and that of the kingdom, (in

which theirs too is involved,) to imagine themselves betrayed, and their

interests abandoned to the rage and malice of an irreconcilable enemy,

whom, for your sake, they have dared to provoke. Beware,” and at these

words he laid his hand on his sword, “beware, lest despair cause them to

seek safety by some other means than by adhering to you, who know not how

to consult your own safety.”[*] Such arguments prevailed; though

ninety-one members had still the courage to oppose. It was voted, that no

more addresses be made to the king, nor any letters or messages be

received from him; and that it be treason for any one, without leave of

the two houses, to have any intercourse with him. The lords concurred in

the same ordinance.[**]

 

By this vote of non-addresses,—so it was called,—the king was

in reality dethroned, and the whole constitution formally overthrown. So

violent a measure was supported by a declaration of the commons no less

violent. The blackest calumnies were there thrown upon the king; such as,

even in their famous remonstrance, they thought proper to omit, as

incredible and extravagant: the poisoning of his father, the betraying of

Rochelle, the contriving of the Irish massacre.[***] By blasting his fame,

had that injury been in their power, they formed a very proper prelude to

the executing of violence on his person.

 

No sooner had the king refused his assent to the four bills, than Hammond,

by orders from the army, removed all his servants, cut off his

correspondence with his friends, and shut him up in close confinement. The

king afterwards showed to Sir Philip Warwick a decrepit old man, who, he

said, was employed to kindle his fire, and was the best company he enjoyed

during several months that this rigorous confinement lasted.[****]

 

No amusement was allowed him, nor society, which might relieve his anxious

thoughts: to be speedily poisoned or assassinated was the only prospect

which he had every moment before his eyes; for he entertained no

apprehension of a judicial sentence and execution; an event of which no

history hitherto furnished an example. Meanwhile, the parliament was very

industrious in publishing, from time to time, the intelligence which they

received from Hammond; how cheerful the king was, how pleased with every

one that approached him, how satisfied in his present condition:[*] as if

the view of such benignity and constancy had not been more proper to

inflame than allay the general compassion of the people.

 

The great source whence the king derived consolation amidst all his

calamities, was undoubtedly religion; a principle which, in him, seems to

have contained nothing fierce or gloomy, nothing which enraged him against

his adversaries, or terrified him with the dismal prospect of futurity.

While every thing around him bore a hostile aspect; while friends, family,

relations, whom he passionately loved, were placed at a distance, and

unable to serve him, he reposed himself with confidence in the arms of

that Being who penetrates and sustains all nature, and whose severities,

if received with piety and resignation, he regarded as the surest pledges

of unexhausted favor.

 

The parliament and army, meanwhile, enjoyed not in tranquillity that power

which they had obtained with so much violence and injustice. Combinations

and conspiracies, they were sensible, were every where forming around

them; and Scotland, whence the king’s cause had received the first fatal

disaster, seemed now to promise it support and assistance.

 

Before the surrender of the king’s person at Newcastle, and much more

since that event, the subjects of discontent had been daily multiplying

between the two kingdoms. The Independents, who began to prevail, took all

occasions of mortifying the Scots, whom the Presbyterians looked on with

the greatest affection and veneration. When the Scottish commissioners,

who, joined to a committee of English lords and commons, had managed the

war, were ready to depart, it was proposed in parliament to give them

thanks for their civilities and good offices. The Independents insisted,

that the words “good offices” should be struck out; and thus the whole

brotherly friendship and intimate alliance with the Scots resolved itself

into an acknowledgment of their being well-bred gentlemen.

 

The advance of the army to London, the subjection of the parliament, the

seizing of the king at Holdenby, his confinement in Carisbroke Castle,

were so many blows sensibly felt by that nation, as threatening the final

overthrow of Presbytery, to which they were so passionately devoted. The

covenant was profanely called, in the house of commons an almanac out of

date;[*] and that impiety, though complained of, had passed uncensured.

Instead of being able to determine and establish orthodoxy by the sword

and by penal statutes, they saw the sectarian army, who were absolute

masters, claim an unbounded liberty of conscience, which the Presbyterians

regarded with the utmost abhorrence. All the violences put on the king,

they loudly blamed, as repugnant to the covenant by which they stood

engaged to defend his royal person. And those very actions of which they

themselves had been guilty, they denominated treason and rebellion, when

executed by an opposite party.

 

The earls of Loudon, Lauderdale, and Laneric, who were sent to London,

protested against the four bills, as containing too great a diminution of

the king’s civil power, and providing no security for religion. They

complained that, notwithstanding this protestation, the bills were still

insisted on, contrary to the solemn league, and to the treaty between the

two nations. And when they accompanied the English commissioners to the

Isle of Wight, they secretly formed a treaty with the king for arming

Scotland in his favor.[**]

 

Three parties at that time prevailed in Scotland: the “royalists,” who

insisted upon the restoration of the king’s authority, without any regard

to religion sects or tenets: of these, Montrose, though absent, was

regarded as the head. The “rigid Presbyterians,” who hated the king even

more than they abhorred toleration; and who determined to give him no

assistance, till he should subscribe the covenant: these were governed by

Argyle. The “moderate Presbyterians,” who endeavored to reconcile the

interests of religion and of the crown; and hoped, by supporting the

Presbyterian party in England, to suppress the sectarian army, and to

reinstate the parliament, as well as the king, in their just freedom and

authority: the two brothers, Hamilton and Laneric, were leaders of this

party.

 

When Pendennis Castle was surrendered to the parliamentary army, Hamilton,

who then obtained his liberty, returned into Scotland; and being

generously determined to remember ancient favors more than recent

injuries, he immediately embraced, with zeal and success, the protection

of the royal cause. He obtained a vote from the Scottish parliament to arm

forty thousand men in support of the king’s authority, and to call over a

considerable body under Monro, who commanded the Scottish forces in

Ulster. And though he openly protested that the covenant was the

foundation of all his measures, he secretly entered into correspondence

with the English royalists, Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip

Musgrave, who had levied considerable forces in the north of England.

 

The general assembly, who sat at the same time, and was guided by Argyle,

dreaded the consequences of these measures; and foresaw that the opposite

party, if successful, would effect the restoration of monarchy, without

the establishment of Presbytery in England. To join the king before he had

subscribed the covenant, was, in their eyes, to restore him to his honor

before Christ had obtained his;[*] and they thundered out anathemas

against every one who paid obedience to the parliament.

 

Two supreme independent judicatures were erected in the kingdom; one

threatening the people with damnation and eternal torments, the other with

imprisonment, banishment, and military execution. The people were

distracted in their choice; and the armament of Hamilton’s party, though

seconded by all the civil power, went on but slowly. The royalists he

would not as yet allow to join him, lest he might give offence to the

ecclesiastical party; though he secretly promised them trust and

preferment as soon as his army should advance into England.

 

While the Scots were making preparations for the invasion of England,

every part of that kingdom was agitated with tumults, insurrections,

conspiracies, discontents. It is seldom that the people gain any thing by

revolutions in government; because the new settlement, jealous and

insecure, must commonly be supported with more expense and severity than

the old: but on no occasion was the truth of this maxim more sensibly

felt, than in the present situation of England. Complaints against the

oppression of ship money, against the tyranny of the star chamber, had

roused the people to arms: and having gained a complete victory over the

crown, they found themselves loaded with a multiplicity of taxes, formerly

unknown; and scarcely an appearance of law and liberty remained in the

administration. The Presbyterians, who had chiefly supported the war, were

enraged to find the prize, just when it seemed within their reach,

snatched by violence from them. The royalists, disappointed in their

expectations by the cruel treatment which the king now received from the

army, were strongly animated to restore him to liberty, and to recover the

advantages which they had unfortunately lost. All orders of men were

inflamed with indignation at seeing the military prevail over the civil

power, and king and parliament at once reduced to subjection by a

mercenary army. Many persons of family and distinction had, from the

beginning of the war, adhered to the parliament: but all these were, by

the new party, deprived of authority; and every office was intrusted to

the most ignoble part of the nation. A base populace, exalted above their

superiors; hypocrites, exercising iniquity under the visor of religion:

these circumstances promised not much liberty or lenity to the people; and

these were now found united in the same usurped and illegal

administration.

 

Though the whole nation seemed to combine in their hatred of military

tyranny, the ends which the several parties pursued were so different,

that little concert was observed in their insurrections. Langhorne, Poyer,

and Powel, Presbyterian officers, who commanded bodies of troops in Wales,

were the first that declared themselves; and they drew together a

considerable army in those parts, which were extremely devoted to the

royal cause. An insurrection was raised in Kent by young Hales and the

earl of Norwich. Lord Capel, Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Lisle, excited

commotions in Essex. The earl of Holland, who had several times changed

sides since the commencement of the civil wars, endeavored to assemble

forces in Surrey. Pomfret Castle, in Yorkshire, was surprised by Morrice.

Langdale and Musgrave were in arms, and masters of Berwick and Carlisle in

the north.

 

What seemed the most dangerous circumstance, the general spirit of

discontent had seized the fleet. Seventeen ships, lying in the mouth of

the river, declared for the king; and putting Rainsborow, their admiral,

ashore, sailed over to Holland, where the prince of Wales took the command

of them.[*]

 

The English royalists exclaimed loudly against Hamilton’s delays, which

they attributed to a refined policy in the Scots as if their intentions

were, that all the king’s party should first be suppressed, and the

victory remain solely to the Presbyterians. Hamilton, with better reason,

complained of the precipitate humor of the English royalists, who, by

their ill-timed insurrections, forced him to march his army before his

levies were completed, or his preparations in any forwardness.

 

No commotions beyond a tumult of the apprentices, which was soon

suppressed, were raised in London: the terror of the army kept the

citizens in subjection. The parliament was so overawed, that they declared

the Scots to be enemies, and all who joined them traitors. Ninety members,

however, of the lower house had the courage to dissent from this vote.

 

Cromwell and the military council prepared themselves with vigor and

conduct for defence. The establishment of the army was at this time

twenty-six thousand men; but by enlisting supernumeraries the regiments

were greatly augmented, and commonly consisted of more than double their

stated complement.[*]

 

Colonel Horton first attacked the revolted troops in Wales, and gave them

a considerable defeat. The remnants of the vanquished threw themselves

into Pembroke, and were there closely besieged, and soon after taken by

Cromwell. Lambert was opposed to Langdale and Musgrave in the north, and

gained advantages over them. Sir Michael Livesey defeated the earl of

Holland at Kingston, and pursuing his victory, took him prisoner at St.

Neots. Fairfax, having routed the Kentish royalists at Maidstone, followed

the broken army; and when they joined the royalists of Essex, and threw

themselves into Colchester, he laid siege to that place, which defended

itself to the last extremity. A new fleet was manned, and sent out under

the command of War wick, to oppose the revolted ships, of which the prince

had taken the command.

 

While the forces were employed in all quarters, the parliament regained

its liberty, and began to act with its wonted courage and spirit. The

members who had withdrawn from terror of the army, returned; and infusing

boldness into their companions, restored to the Presbyterian party the

ascendant which it had formerly lost. The eleven impeached members were

recalled, and the vote by which they were expelled was reversed. The vote,

too, of non-addresses was repealed; and commissioners, five peers and ten

commoners, were sent to Newport in the Isle of Wight, in order to treat

with the king.[*] He was allowed to summon several of his friends and old

counsellors, that he might have their advice in this important

transaction.[**] The theologians on both sides, armed with their

syllogisms and quotations, attended as auxiliaries.[***] By them the flame

had first been raised; and their appearance was but a bad prognostic of

its extinction. Any other instruments seemed better adapted for a treaty

of pacification.

 

When the king presented himself to this company, a great and sensible

alteration was remarked in his aspect, from what it appeared the year

before, when he resided at Hampton Court. The moment his servants had been

removed, he had laid aside all care of his person, and had allowed his

beard and hair to grow, and to hang dishevelled and neglected. His hair

was become almost entirely gray, either from the decline of years, or from

that load of sorrows under which he labored; and which, though borne with

constancy, preyed inwardly on his sensible and tender mind. His friends

beheld with compassion, and perhaps even his enemies, “that gray and

discrowned head,” as he himself terms it, in a copy of verses, which the

truth of the sentiment, rather than any elegance of expression, renders

very pathetic.[****] Having in vain endeavored by courage to defend his

throne from his armed adversaries, it now behoved him, by reasoning and

persuasion, to save some fragments of it from these peaceful, and no less

implacable negotiators.

 

The vigor of the king’s mind, notwithstanding the seeming decline of his

body, here appeared unbroken and undecayed. The parliamentary

commissioners would allow none of his council to be present, and refused

to enter into reasoning with any but himself. He alone, during the

transactions of two months, was obliged to maintain the argument against

fifteen men of the greatest parts and capacity in both houses; and no

advantage was ever obtained over him,[v] This was the scene above all

others in which he was qualified to excel. A quick conception, a

cultivated understanding, a chaste conclusion, a dignified manner; by

these accomplishments he triumphed in all discussions of cool and

temperate reasoning.

 

“The king is much changed,” said the earl of Salisbury to Sir Philip

Warwick: “he is extremely improved of late.” “No,” replied Sir Philip, “he

was always so: but you are now at last sensible of it.”[*] Sir Henry Vane,

discoursing with his fellow-commissioners, drew an argument from the

king’s uncommon abilities, why the terms of pacification must be rendered

more strict and rigid.[**] But Charles’s capacity shone not equally in

action as in reasoning.

 

The first point insisted on by the parliamentary commissioners, was the

king’s recalling all his proclamations and declarations against the

parliament, and the acknowledging that they had taken arms in their own

defence. He frankly offered the former concession, but long scrupled the

latter. The falsehood, as well as indignity of that acknowledgment, begat

in his breast an extreme reluctance against it. The king had, no doubt, in

some particulars of moment, invaded, from a seeming necessity, the

privileges of his people: but having renounced all claim to these usurped

powers, having confessed his errors, and having repaired every breach in

the constitution, and even erected new ramparts in order to secure it, he

could no longer, at the commencement of the war, be represented as the

aggressor. However it might be pretended, that the former display of his

arbitrary inclinations, or rather his monarchical principles, rendered an

offensive or preventive war in the parliament prudent and reasonable, it

could never in any propriety of speech, make it be termed a defensive one.

But the parliament, sensible that the letter of the law condemned them as

rebels and traitors, deemed this point absolutely necessary for their

future security; and the king, finding that peace could be obtained on no

other terms, at last yielded to it. He only entered a protest, which was

admitted, that no concession made by him should be valid, unless the whole

treaty of pacification were concluded.[***]

 

He agreed that the parliament should retain, during the term of twenty

years, the power over the militia and army, and that of levying what money

they pleased for their support. He even yielded to them the right of

resuming, at any time afterwards, this authority, whenever they should

declare such a resumption necessary for public safety. In effect, the

important power of the sword was forever ravished from him and his

successors.[*]

 

He agreed that all the great offices, during twenty years should be filled

by both houses of parliament.[**] He relinquished to them the entire

government of Ireland, and the conduct of the war there.[***] He renounced

the power of the wards, and accepted of one hundred thousand pounds a year

in lieu of it.[****] He acknowledged the validity of their great seal, and

gave up his own.[v] He abandoned the power of creating peers without

consent of parliament. And he agreed, that all the debts contracted in

order to support the war against him, should be paid by the people.

 

So great were the alterations made on the English constitution by this

treaty, that the king said, not without reason, that he had been more an

enemy to his people by these concessions, could he have prevented them,

than by any other action of his life.

 

Of all the demands of the parliament, Charles refused only two. Though he

relinquished almost every power of the crown, he would neither give up his

friends to punishment, nor desert what he esteemed his religious duty. The

severe repentance which he had undergone for abandoning Strafford, had no

doubt confirmed him in the resolution never again to be guilty of a like

error. His long solitude and severe afflictions had contributed to rivet

him the more in those religious principles which had ever a considerable

influence over him. His desire, however, of finishing an accommodation,

induced him to go as far in both these particulars as he thought any wise

consistent with his duty.

 

The estates of the royalists being at that time almost entirely under

sequestration, Charles who could give them no protection, consented that

they should pay such compositions as they and the parliament should agree

on; and only begged that they might be made as moderate as possible. He

had not the disposal of offices; and it seemed but a small sacrifice to

consent, that a certain number of his friends should be rendered incapable

of public employments.[v*]

 

But when the parliament demanded a bill of attainder and banishment

against seven persons, the marquis of Newcastle, Lord Digby, Lord

Biron, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, Sir Richard Granville, Sir Francis

Doddington, and Judge Jenkins, the king absolutely refused compliance;

their banishment for a limited time he was willing to agree to.[*]

 

Religion was the fatal point about which the differences had arisen; and

of all others, it was the least susceptible of composition or moderation

between the contending parties. The parliament insisted on the

establishment of Presbytery, the sale of the chapter lands, the abolition

of all forms of prayer, and strict laws against Catholics. The king

offered to retrench every thing which he did not esteem of apostolicat

institution: he was willing to abolish archbishops, deans prebends,

canons: he offered that the chapter lands should be let at low leases

during ninety-nine years; he consented, that the present church government

should continue during three years:[*] after that time, he required not

that any thing should be restored to bishops but the power of ordination,

and even that power to be exercised by advice of the presbyters.[**] If

the parliament, upon the expiration of that period, still insisted on

their demand, all other branches of episcopal jurisdiction were abolished,

and a new form of church government must, by common consent, be

established. The Book of Common Prayer he was willing to renounce, but

required the liberty of using some other liturgy in his own chapel; [***]

a demand, which, though seemingly reasonable, was positively refused by

the parliament.

 

In the dispute on these articles, one is not surprised that two of the

parliamentary theologians should tell the king, “that if he did not

consent to the utter abolition of Episcopacy he would be damned.” But it

is not without some indignation that we read the following vote of the

lords and commons: “The houses, out of their detestation to that

abominable idolatry used in the mass, do declare, that they cannot admit

of, or consent unto, any such indulgence in any law, as is desired by his

majesty, for exempting the queen and her family from the penalties to be

enacted against the exercise of the mass.” ****

 

The treaty of marriage, the regard to the queen’s sex and high station,

even common humanity; all considerations were undervalued, in comparison

of their bigoted prejudices.[*] 19
 

It was evidently the interest, both of king and parliament, to finish

their treaty with all expedition; and endeavor by their combined force to

resist, if possible, the usurping fury of the army. It seemed even the

interest of the parliament to leave in the king’s hand a considerable

share of authority, by which he might be enabled to protect them and

himself from so dangerous an enemy. But the terms on which they insisted

were so rigorous, that the king, fearing no worse from the most implacable

enemies, was in no haste to come to a conclusion. And so great was the

bigotry on both sides, that they were willing to sacrifice the greatest

civil interests, rather than relinquish the most minute of their

theological contentions. From these causes, assisted by the artifice of

the Independents, the treaty was spun out to such a length, that the

invasions and insurrections were every where subdued; and the army had

leisure to execute their violent and sanguinary purposes.

 

Hamilton, having entered England with a numerous though undisciplined

army, durst not unite his forces with those of Langdale; because the

English royalists had refused to take the covenant; and the Scottish

Presbyterians, though engaged for the king, refused to join them on any

other terms. The two armies marched together, though at some distance; nor

could even the approach of the parliamentary army under Cromwell, oblige

the Covenanters to consult their own safety, by a close union with the

royalists. When principles are so absurd and so destructive of human

society, it may safely be averred, that the more sincere and the more

disinterested they are, they only become the more ridiculous and the more

odious.

 

Cromwell feared not to oppose eight thousand men to the numerous armies of

twenty thousand commanded by Hamilton and Langdale. He attacked the latter

by surprise near Preston, in Lancashire; and though the royalists made a

brave resistance, yet, not being succored in time by their confederates,

they were almost entirely cut in pieces. Hamilton was next attacked, put

to rout, and pursued to Utoxeter, where he surrendered himself prisoner.

Cromwell followed his advantage; and, marching into Scotland with a

considerable body joined Argyle, who was also in arms; and having

suppressed Laneric, Monro, and other moderate Presbyterians he placed the

power entirely in the hands of the violent party. The ecclesiastical

authority, exalted above the civil, exercised the severest vengeance on

all who had a share in Hamilton’s engagement, as it was called; nor could

any of that party recover trust, or even live in safety, but by doing

solemn and public penance for taking arms, by authority of parliament in

defence of their lawful sovereign.

 

The chancellor, Loudon, who had at first countenanced Hamilton’s

enterprise, being terrified with the menaces of the clergy, had some time

before gone over to the other party; and he now openly in the church,

though invested with the highest civil character in the kingdom, did

penance for his obedience to the parliament, which he termed a “carnal

self-seeking.” He accompanied his penance with so many tears, and such

pathetical addresses to the people for their prayers in this his uttermost

sorrow and distress, that a universal weeping and lamentation took place

among the deluded audience.[*]

 

The loan of great sums of money, often to the ruin of families, was

exacted from all such as lay under any suspicion of favoring the king’s

party, though their conduct had been ever so inoffensive. This was a

device fallen upon by the ruling party, in order, as they said, to reach

“heart malignants.”[**] Never in this island was known a more severe and

arbitrary government, than was generally exercised by the patrons of

liberty in both kingdoms.

 

The siege of Colchester terminated in a manner no less unfortunate than

Hamilton’s engagement for the royal cause. After suffering the utmost

extremities of famine, after feeding on the vilest aliments, the garrison

desired at last to capitulate. Fairfax required them to surrender at

discretion; and he gave such an explanation to these terms, as to reserve

to himself power, if he pleased, to put them all instantly to the sword.

The officers endeavored, though in vain, to persuade the soldiers, by

making a vigorous sally, to break through, at least to sell their lives as

dear as possible. They were obliged to accept of the conditions offered;

and Fairfax, instigated by Ireton, to whom Cromwell in his absence had

consigned over the government of the passive general, seized Sir Charles

and resolved to make them instant sacrifices to military justice. This

unusual severity was loudly exclaimed against by all the prisoners. Lord

Capel, fearless of danger, reproached Ireton with it; and challenged him,

as they were all engaged in the same honorable cause, to exercise the same

impartial vengeance on all of them. Lucas was first shot; and he himself

gave orders to fire, with the same alacrity as if he had commanded a

platoon of his own soldiers. Lisle instantly ran and kissed the dead body,

then cheerfully presented himself to a like fate. Thinking that the

soldiers destined for his execution stood at too great a distance, he

called to them to come nearer: one of them replied, “I’ll warrant you,

sir, we’ll hit you:” he answered, smiling, “Friends, I have been nearer

you, when you have missed me.” Thus perished this generous spirit, not

less beloved for his modesty and humanity, than esteemed for his courage

and military conduct.

 

Soon after, a gentleman appearing in the king’s presence clothed in

mourning for Sir Charles Lucas, that humane prince, suddenly recollecting

the hard fate of his friends, paid them a tribute which none of his own

unparalleled misfortunes ever extorted from him: he dissolved into a flood

of tears.[*]

 

By these multiplied successes of the army, they had subdued all their

enemies; and none remained but the helpless king and parliament to oppose

their violent measures. From Cromwell’s suggestion, a remonstrance was

drawn by the council of general officers, and sent to the parliament. They

there complain of the treaty with the king; demand his punishment for the

blood spilt during the war; require a dissolution of the present

parliament, and a more equal representative for the future; and assert

that, though servants, they are entitled to represent these important

points to their masters, who are themselves no better than servants and

trustees of the people. At the same time, they advanced with the army to

Windsor, and sent Colonel Eure to seize the king’s person at Newport, and

convey him to Hurst Castle, in the neighborhood, where he was detained in

strict confinement.

 

 ENLARGE
 

This measure being foreseen some time before, the king was exhorted to

make his escape, which was conceived to be very easy: but having given his

word to the parliament not to attempt the recovery of his liberty during

the treaty, and three weeks after, he would not, by any persuasion, be

induced to hazard the reproach of violating that promise. In vain was it

urged, that a promise given to the parliament could no longer be binding;

since they could no longer afford him protection from violence threatened

him by other persons, to whom he was bound by no tie or engagement. The

king would indulge no refinements of casuistry, however plausible, in such

delicate subjects; and was resolved that, what depredations soever fortune

should commit upon him, she never should bereave him of his honor.[*]

 

The parliament lost not courage, notwithstanding the danger with which

they were so nearly menaced. Though without any plan for resisting

military usurpations, they resolved to withstand them to the uttermost;

and rather to bring on a violent and visible subversion of government,

than lend their authority to those illegal and sanguinary measures which

were projected. They set aside the remonstrance of the army, without

deigning to answer it; they voted the seizing of the king’s person to be

without their consent, and sent a message to the general, to know by what

authority that enterprise had been executed; and they issued orders that

the army should advance no nearer to London.

 

Hollis, the present leader of the Presbyterians, was a man of

unconquerable intrepidity; and many others of that party seconded his

magnanimous spirit. It was proposed by them, that the generals and

principal officers should, for their disobedience and usurpations, be

proclaimed traitors by the parliament.

 

But the parliament was dealing with men who would not be frightened by

words, nor retarded by any scrupulous delicacy. The generals, under the

name of Fairfax, (for he still allowed them to employ his name,) marched

the army to London, and placing guards in Whitehall, the Mews, St.

James’s, Durham House, Covent Garden, and Palace Yard, surrounded the

parliament with their hostile armaments.

 

The parliament, destitute of all hopes of prevailing, retained, however,

courage to resist. They attempted, in the face of the army, to close their

treaty with the king; and, though they had formerly voted his concessions

with regard to the church and delinquents to be unsatisfactory, they now

took into consideration the final resolution with regard to the whole.

 

After a violent debate of three days, it was carried, by a majority of one

hundred and twenty-nine against eighty-three, in the house of commons,

that the king’s concessions were a foundation for the houses to proceed

upon in the settlement of the kingdom.

 

Next day, when the commons were to meet, Colonel Pride formerly a drayman,

had environed the house with two regiments; and, directed by Lord Grey of

Groby, he seized in the passage forty-one members of the Presbyterian

party, and sent them to a low room, which passed by the appellation of

“hell;” whence they were afterwards carried to several inns. Above one

hundred and sixty members more were excluded, and none were allowed to

enter but the most furious and the most determined of the Independents;

and these exceeded not the number of fifty or sixty. This invasion of the

parliament commonly passed under the name of “Colonel Pride’s Purge;” so

much disposed was the nation to make merry with the dethroning of those

members who had violently arrogated the whole authority of government, and

deprived the king of his legal prerogatives.

 

The subsequent proceedings of the parliament, if this diminutive assembly

deserve that honorable name, retain not the least appearance of law,

equity, or freedom. They instantly reversed the former vote, and declared

the king’s concessions unsatisfactory. They determined that no member

absent at this last vote should be received till he subscribed it, as

agree able to his judgment. They renewed their former vote of

non-addresses. And they committed to prison Sir William Waller, Sir John

Clotworthy, the generals Massey, Brown, Copley, and other leaders of the

Presbyterians. These men, by their credit and authority, which was then

very high, had, at the commencement of the war, supported the parliament;

and thereby prepared the way for the greatness of the present leaders, who

at that time were of small account in the nation.

 

The secluded members having published a paper, containing a narrative of

the violence which had been exercised upon them, and a protestation, that

all acts were void, which from that time had been transacted in the house

of commons, the remaining members encountered it with a declaration, in

which they pronounced it false, scandalous, seditious, and tending to the

destruction of the visible and fundamental government of the kingdom.

 

These sudden and violent revolutions held the whole nation in terror and

astonishment. Every man dreaded to be trampled under foot, in the

contention between those mighty powers which disputed for the sovereignty

of the state. Many began to withdraw their effects beyond sea: foreigners

scrupled to give any credit to a people so torn by domestic faction, and

oppressed by military usurpation: even the internal commerce of the

kingdom began to stagnate: and in order to remedy these growing evils, the

generals, in the name of the army, published a declaration, in which they

expressed their resolution of supporting law and justice.[*]

 

The more to quiet the minds of men, the council of officers took into

consideration a scheme called “the agreement of the people;” being the

plan of a republic, to be substituted in the place of that government

which they so violently pulled in pieces. Many parts of this scheme for

correcting the inequalities of the representative, are plausible; had the

nation been disposed to receive it, or had the army intended to impose it.

Other parts are too perfect for human nature, and savor strongly of that

fanatical spirit so prevalent throughout the kingdom.

 

The height of all iniquity and fanatical extravagance yet remained—the

public trial and execution of their sovereign. To this period was every

measure precipitated by the zealous Independents. The parliamentary

leaders of that party had intended, that the army themselves should

execute that daring enterprise; and they deemed so irregular and lawless a

deed best fitted to such irregular and lawless instruments.[**] But the

generals were too wise to load themselves singly with the infamy which,

they knew, must attend an action so shocking to the general sentiments of

mankind. The parliament, they were resolved, should share with them the

reproach of a measure which was thought requisite for the advancement of

their common ends of safety and ambition. In the house of commons,

therefore, a committee was appointed to bring in a charge against the

king. On their report a vote passed, declaring it treason in a king to

levy war against his parliament, and appointing a high court of justice to

try Charles for this new-invented treason. This vote was sent up to the

house of peers.

 

The house of peers, during the civil wars, had all along been of small

account; but it had lately, since the king’s fall, become totally

contemptible; and very few members would submit to the mortification of

attending it. It happened that day to be fuller than usual, and they were

assembled to the number of sixteen. Without one dissenting voice, and

almost without deliberation, they instantly rejected the vote of the lower

house, and adjourned themselves for ten days, hoping that this delay would

be able to retard the furious career of the commons.

 

1649.

 

The commons were not to be stopped by so small an obstacle. Having first

established a principle which is noble in itself, and seems specious, but

is belied by all history and experience, “that the people are the origin

of all just power;” they next declared, that the commons of England,

assembled in parliament, being chosen by the people, and representing

them, are the supreme authority of the nation, and that whatever is

enacted and declared to be law by the commons, hath the force of law,

without the consent of king or house of peers. The ordinance for the trial

of Charles Stuart, king of England, (so they called him,) was again read,

and unanimously assented to.

 

In proportion to the enormity of the violences and usurpations, were

augmented the pretences of sanctity, among those regicides. “Should any

one have voluntarily proposed,” said Cromwell in the house, “to bring the

king to punishment, I should have regarded him as the greatest traitor;

but since Providence and necessity have cast us upon it, I will pray to

God for a blessing on your counsels; though I am not prepared to give you

any advice on this important occasion. Even I myself,” subjoined he, “when

I was lately offering up petitions for his majesty’s restoration, felt my

tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, and considered this preternatural

movement as the answer which Heaven, having rejected the king, had sent to

my supplications.”

 

A woman of Hertfordshire, illuminated by prophetical visions, desired

admittance into the military council, and communicated to the officers a

revelation, which assured them that their measures were consecrated from

above, and ratified by a heavenly sanction. This intelligence gave them

great comfort, and much confirmed them in their present resolutions.[*]

 

Colonel Harrison, the son of a butcher, and the most furious enthusiast in

the army, was sent with a strong party to conduct the king to London. At

Windsor, Hamilton, who was there detained a prisoner, was admitted into

the king’s presence: and falling on his knees, passionately exclaimed, “My

dear master!”—-“I have indeed been so to you,” replied Charles,

embracing him. No further intercourse was allowed between them, The king

was instantly hurried away. Hamilton long followed him with his eyes all

suffused in tears, and prognosticated, that in this short salutation, he

had given the last adieu to his sovereign and his friend.

 

Charles himself was assured that the period of his life was now

approaching; but notwithstanding all the preparations which were making,

and the intelligence which he received, he could not even yet believe that

his enemies really meant to conclude their violences by a public trial and

execution. A private assassination he every moment looked for; and though

Harrison assured him that his apprehensions were entirely groundless, it

was by that catastrophe, so frequent with dethroned princes, that he

expected to terminate his life. In appearance, as well as in reality, the

king was now dethroned. All the exterior symbols of sovereignty were

withdrawn, and his attendants had orders to serve him without ceremony. At

first, he was shocked with instances of rudeness and familiarity, to which

he had been so little accustomed. “Nothing so contemptible as a despised

prince!” was the reflection which they suggested to him. But he soon

reconciled his mind to this, as he had done to his other calamities.

 

All the circumstances of the trial were now adjusted, and the high court

of justice fully constituted. It consisted of one hundred and thirty-three

persons, as named by the commons; but there scarcely ever sat above

seventy: so difficult was it, notwithstanding the blindness of prejudice

and the allurements of interest, to engage men of any name or character in

that criminal measure. Cromwell, Ireton, Harrison, and the chief officers

of the army, most of them of mean birth, were members, together with some

of the lower house, and some citizens of London. The twelve judges were at

first appointed in the number: but as they had affirmed, that it was

contrary to all the ideas of English law to try the king for treason, by

whose authority all accusations for treason must necessarily be conducted,

their names, as well as those of some peers, were afterwards struck out.

Bradshaw, a lawyer, was chosen president. Coke was appointed solicitor for

the people of England. Dorislaus, Steele, and Arke, were named assistants.

The court sat in Westminster Hall.

 

It is remarkable, that in calling over the court, when the crier

pronounced the name of Fairfax, which had been inserted in the number, a

voice came from one of the spectators, and cried, “He has more wit than to

be here.” When the charge was read against the king, “In the name of the

people of England,” the same voice exclaimed, “Not a tenth part of them.”

Axtel, the officer who guarded the court, giving orders to fire into the

box whence these insolent speeches came, it was discovered that Lady

Fairfax was there, and that it was she who had had the courage to utter

them. She was a person of noble extraction, daughter of Horace Lord Vere

of Tilbury; but being seduced by the violence of the times, she had long

seconded her husband’s zeal against the royal cause, and was now, as well

as he, struck with abhorrence at the fatal and unexpected consequence of

all his boasted victories.

 

The pomp, the dignity, the ceremony of this transaction corresponded to

the greatest conception that is suggested in the annals of human kind; the

delegates of a great people sitting in judgment upon their supreme

magistrate, and trying him for his misgovernment and breach of trust. The

solicitor, in the name of the commons, represented, that Charles Stuart,

being admitted king of England, and intrusted with a limited power, yet

nevertheless, from a wicked design to erect an unlimited and tyrannical

government, had traitorously and maliciously levied war against the

present parliament, and the people, whom they represented, and was

therefore impeached as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and a public and

implacable enemy to the commonwealth. After the charge was finished, the

president directed his discourse to the king, and told him that the court

expected his answer.

 

The king, though long detained a prisoner, and now produced as a criminal,

sustained, by his magnanimous courage, the majesty of a monarch. With

great temper and dignity, he declined the authority of the court, and

refused to submit himself to their jurisdiction. He represented, that

having been engaged in treaty with his two houses of parliament, and

having finished almost every article, he had expected to be brought to his

capital in another manner, and ere this time to have been restored to his

power, dignity, revenue, as well as to his personal liberty: that he could

not now perceive any appearance of the upper house, so essential a member

of the constitution; and had learned, that even the commons, whose

authority was pretended, were subdued by lawless force, and were bereaved

of their liberty: that he himself was their “native, hereditary king;” nor

was the whole authority of the state, though free and united, entitled to

try him, who derived his dignity from the Supreme Majesty of heaven: that,

admitting those extravagant principles which levelled all orders of men,

the court could plead no power delegated by the people; unless the consent

of every individual, down to the meanest and most ignorant peasant, had

been previously asked and obtained: that he acknowledged, without scruple,

that he had a trust committed to him, and one most sacred and inviolable;

he was intrusted with the liberties of his people, and would not now

betray them by recognizing a power founded on the most atrocious violence

and usurpation: that having taken arms, and frequently exposed his life in

defence of public liberty, of the constitution, of the fundamental laws of

the kingdom, he was willing in this last and most solemn scene, to seal

with his blood those precious rights for which, though in vain, he had so

long contended: that those who arrogated a title to sit as his judges,

were born his subjects, and born subjects to those laws which determined

“that the king can do no wrong:” that he was not reduced to the necessity

of sheltering himself under this general maxim which guards every English

monarch, even the least deserving; but was able, by the most satisfactory

reasons, to justify those measures in which he had been engaged: that to

the whole world, and even to them, his pretended judges, he was desirous,

if called upon in another manner, to prove the integrity of his conduct,

and assert the justice of those defensive arms to which, unwillingly and

unfortunately, he had had recourse; but that, in order to preserve a

uniformity of conduct, he must at present forego the apology of his

innocence lest, by ratifying an authority no better founded than that of

robbers and pirates, he be justly branded as the betrayer instead of being

applauded as the martyr, of the constitution.

 

The president, in order to support the majesty of the people, and maintain

the superiority of his court above the prisoner still inculcated, that he

must not decline the authority of his judges; that they overruled his

objections; that they were delegated by the people, the only source of

every lawful power; and that kings themselves acted but in trust from that

community which had invested this high court of justice with its

jurisdiction. Even according to those principles, which, in his present

situation, he was perhaps obliged to adopt, his behavior in general will

appear not a little harsh and barbarous; but when we consider him as a

subject, and one too of no high character, addressing himself to his

unfortunate sovereign, his style will be esteemed to the last degree

audacious and insolent.

 

 ENLARGE
 

Three times was Charles produced before the court, and as often declined

their jurisdiction. On the fourth, the judges having examined some

witnesses, by whom it was proved that the king had appeared in arms

against the forces commissioned by the parliament, they pronounced

sentence against him. He seemed very anxious at this time to be admitted

to a conference with the two houses; and it was supposed, that he intended

to resign the crown to his son: but the court refused compliance, and

considered that request as nothing but a delay of justice.

 

It is confessed, that the king’s behavior during this last scene of his

life does honor to his memory; and that, in all appearances before his

judges, he never forgot his part, either as a prince or as a man. Firm and

intrepid, he maintained, in each reply, the utmost perspicuity and

justness both of thought and expression; mild and equable, he rose into no

passion at that unusual authority which was assumed over him. His soul,

without effort or affectation, seemed only to remain in the situation

familiar to it, and to look down with contempt on all the efforts of human

malice and iniquity. The soldiers, instigated by their superiors, were

brought, though with difficulty, to cry aloud for justice. “Poor souls!”

said the king to one of his attendants, “for a little money they would do

as much against their commanders.”[*] Some of them were permitted to go

the utmost length of brutal insolence, and to spit in his face, as he was

conducted along the passage to the court. To excite a sentiment of pity

was the only effect which this inhuman insult was able to produce upon

him.

 

The people, though under the rod of lawless, unlimited power, could not

forbear, with the most ardent prayers, pouring forth their wishes for his

preservation; and in his present distress, they avowed him, by their

generous tears, for their monarch, whom, in their misguided fury, they had

before so violently rejected. The king was softened at this moving scene,

and expressed his gratitude for their dutiful affection. One soldier, too,

seized by contagious sympathy, demanded from Heaven a blessing on

oppressed and fallen majesty: his officer, overhearing the prayer, beat

him to the ground in the king’s presence. “The punishment, methinks,

exceeds the offence:” this was the reflection which Charles formed on that

occasion.[*]

 

As soon as the intention of trying the king was known in foreign

countries, so enormous an action was exclaimed against by the general

voice of reason and humanity; and all men, under whatever form of

government they were born, rejected the example, as the utmost effort of

undisguised usurpation, and the most heinous insult on law and justice.

The French ambassador, by orders from his court, interposed in the king’s

behalf: the Dutch employed their good offices: the Scots exclaimed and

protested against the violence: the queen, the prince, wrote pathetic

letters to the parliament. All solicitations were found fruitless with men

whose resolutions were fixed and irrevocable.

 

Four of Charles’s friends, persons of virtue and dignity, Richmond,

Hertford, Southampton, Lindesey, applied to the commons. They represented,

that they were the king’s counsellors, and had concurred by their advice

in all those measures which were now imputed as crimes to their royal

master: that, in the eye of the law, and according to the dictates of

common reason, they alone were guilty, and were alone exposed to censure

for every blamable action of the prince; and that they now presented

themselves, in order to save, by their own punishment, that precious life

which it became the commons themselves, and every subject, with the utmost

hazard to protect and defend.[**] Such a generous effort tended to their

honor, but contributed nothing towards the king’s safety.

 

The people remained in that silence and astonishment, which all great

passions, when they have not an opportunity of exerting themselves,

naturally produce in the human mind. The soldiers, being incessantly plied

with prayers, sermons and exhortations, were wrought up to a degree of

fury, and imagined, that in the acts of the most extreme disloyalty

towards their prince consisted their greatest merit in the eye of

Heaven.[*]

 

Three days were allowed the king between his sentence and his execution.

This interval he passed with great tranquillity, chiefly in reading and

devotion. All his family that remained in England were allowed access to

him. It consisted only of the princess Elizabeth and the duke of

Gloucester; for the duke of York had made his escape. Gloucester was

little more than an infant: the princess, notwithstanding her tender

years, showed an advanced judgment; and the calamities of her family had

made a deep impression upon her. After many pious consolations and

advices, the king gave her in charge to tell the queen, that during the

whole course of his life, he had never once, even in thought, failed in

his fidelity towards her; and that his conjugal tenderness and his life

should have an equal duration.

 

To the young duke, too, he could not forbear giving some advice, in order

to season his mind with early principles of loyalty and obedience towards

his brother, who was so soon to be his sovereign. Holding him on his knee,

he said, “Now they will cut off thy father’s head.” At these words, the

child looked very steadfastly upon him. “Mark, child! what I say: they

will cut off my head! and perhaps make thee a king: but mark what I say:

thou must not be a king as long as thy brothers Charles and James are

alive. They will cut off thy brothers’ heads, when they can catch them!

And thy head, too they will cut off at last! Therefore I charge thee, do

not be made a king by them!” The duke, sighing, replied, “I will be torn

in pieces first!” So determined an answer, from one of such tender years,

filled the king’s eyes with tears of joy and admiration.

 

Every night during this interval the king slept as sound as usual; though

the noise of workmen employed in framing the scaffold, and other

preparations for his execution, continually resounded in his ears.[**]

 

The morning of the fatal day he rose early, and calling Herbert, one of

his attendants, he bade him employ more than usual care in dressing him,

and preparing him for so great and joyful a solemnity. Bishop Juxon, a man

endowed with the same mild and steady virtues by which the king himself

was so much distinguished, assisted him in his devotions, and paid the

last melancholy duties to his friend and sovereign.

 

The street before Whitehall was the place destined for the execution; for

it was intended, by choosing that very place, in sight of his own palace,

to display more evidently the triumph of popular justice over royal

majesty. When the king came upon the scaffold, he found it so surrounded

with soldiers, that he could not expect to be heard by any of the people:

he addressed, therefore, his discourse to the few persons who were about

him; particularly Colonel Tomlinson, to whose care he had lately been

committed, and upon whom, as upon many others, his amiable deportment had

wrought an entire conversion. He justified his own innocence in the late

fatal wars; and observed, that he had not taken arms till after the

parliament had enlisted forces; nor had he any other object in his warlike

operations, than to preserve that authority entire which his predecessors

had transmitted to him. He threw not, however, the blame upon the

parliament, but was more inclined to think, that ill instruments had

interposed, and raised in them fears and jealousies with regard to his

intentions. Though innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity

of his execution in the eyes of his Maker; and observed, that an unjust

sentence which he had suffered to take effect, was now punished by an

unjust sentence upon himself. He forgave all his enemies, even the chief

instruments of his death; but exhorted them and the whole nation to return

to the ways of peace, by paying obedience to their lawful sovereign, his

son and successor. When he was preparing himself for the block, Bishop

Juxon called to him: “There is, sir, but one stage more, which, though

turbulent and troublesome, is yet a very short one. Consider, it will soon

carry you a great way; it will carry you from earth to heaven; and there

you shall find, to your great joy, the prize to which you hasten, a crown

of glory.” “I go,” replied the king, “from a corruptible to an

incorruptible crown; where no disturbance can have place.” At one blow was

his head severed from his body. A man in a visor performed the office of

executioner: another, in a like disguise, held up to the spectators the

head, streaming with blood, and cried aloud, “This is the head of a

traitor!”

 

It is impossible to describe the grief, indignation, and astonishment

which took place, not only among the spectators, who were overwhelmed with

a flood of sorrow, but throughout the whole nation, as soon as the report

of this fatal execution was conveyed to them. Never monarch, in the full

triumph of success and victory, was more dear to his people, than his

misfortunes and magnanimity, his patience and piety, had rendered this

unhappy prince. In proportion to their former delusions, which had

animated them against him, was the violence of their return to duty and

affection; while each reproached himself either with active disloyalty

towards him, or with too indolent defence of his oppressed cause. On

weaker minds, the effect of these complicated passions was prodigious.

Women are said to have cast forth the untimely fruit of their womb: others

fell into convulsions, or sunk into such a melancholy as attended them to

their grave: nay, some, unmindful of themselves, as though they could not

or would not survive their beloved prince, it is reported, suddenly fell

down dead. The very pulpits were bedewed with unsuborned tears; those

pulpits, which had formerly thundered out the most violent imprecations

and anathemas against him. And all men united in their detestation of

those hypocritical parricides, who, by sanctified pretences, had so long

disguised their treasons, and in this last act of iniquity had thrown an

indelible stain upon the nation.

 

A fresh instance of hypocrisy was displayed the very day of the king’s

death. The generous Fairfax, not content with being absent from the trial,

had used all the interest which he yet retained to prevent the execution

of the fatal sentence; and had even employed persuasion with his own

regiment, though none else should follow him, to rescue the king from his

disloyal murderers. Cromwell and Ireton, informed of this intention,

endeavored to convince him that the Lord had rejected the king; and they

exhorted him to seek by prayer some direction from Heaven on this

important occasion: but they concealed from him that they had already

signed the warrant for the execution. Harrison was the person appointed to

join in prayer with the unwary general. By agreement, he prolonged his

doleful cant till intelligence arrived, that the fatal blow was struck. He

then rose from his knees, and insisted with Fairfax, that this event was a

miraculous and providential answer which Heaven had sent to their devout

supplications.[*]

 

It being remarked, that the king, the moment before he stretched out his

neck to the executioner, had said to Juxon with a very earnest accent, the

single word “Remember,” great mysteries were supposed to be concealed

under that expression; and the generals vehemently insisted with the

prelate, that he should inform them of the king’s meaning, Juxon told them

that the king, having frequently charged him to inculcate on his son the

forgiveness of his murderers, had taken this opportunity, in the last

moment of his life, when his commands, he supposed would be regarded as

sacred and inviolable, to reiterate that desire; and that his mild spirit

thus terminated its present course by an act of benevolence towards his

greatest enemies.

 

The character of this prince, as that of most men, if not of all men, was

mixed; but his virtues predominated extremely above his vices, or, more

properly speaking, his imperfections; for scarce any of his faults rose to

that pitch as to merit the appellation of vices. To consider him in the

most favorable light, it may be affirmed, that his dignity was free from

pride, his humanity from weakness, his bravery from rashness, his

temperance from austerity, his frugality from avarice; all these virtues

in him maintained their proper bounds, and merited unreserved praise. To

speak the most harshly of him, we may affirm, that many of his good

qualities were attended with some latent frailty, which, though seemingly

inconsiderable was able, when seconded by the extreme malevolence of his

fortune, to disappoint them of all their influence: his beneficent

disposition was clouded by a manner not very gracious; his virtue was

tinctured with superstition; his good sense was disfigured by a deference

to persons of a capacity inferior to his own; and his moderate temper

exempted him not from hasty and precipitate resolutions. He deserves the

epithet of a good, rather than of a great man: and was more fitted to rule

in a regular established government, than either to give way to the

encroachments of a popular assembly, or finally to subdue their

pretensions. He wanted suppleness and dexterity sufficient for the first

measure; he was nor endowed with the vigor requisite for the second. Had

he been born an absolute prince, his humanity and good sense had rendered

his reign happy and his memory precious; had the limitations on

prerogative been in his time quite fixed and certain, his integrity had

made him regard as sacred the boundaries of the constitution. Unhappily,

his fate threw him into a period, when the precedents of many former

reigns savored strongly of arbitrary power, and the genius of the people

ran violently towards liberty. And if his political prudence was not

sufficient to extricate him from so perilous a situation, he may be

excused; since, even after the event, when it is commonly easy to correct

all errors, one is at a loss to determine what conduct, in his

circumstances, could have maintained the authority of the crown, and

preserved the peace of the nation. Exposed, without revenue, without arms,

to the assault of furious, implacable, and bigoted factions, it was never

permitted him, but with the most fatal consequences, to commit the

smallest mistake; a condition too rigorous to be imposed on the greatest

human capacity.

 

Some historians have rashly questioned the good faith of this prince; but,

for this reproach, the most malignant scrutiny of his conduct, which in

every circumstance is now thoroughly known, affords not any reasonable

foundation. On the contrary, if we consider the extreme difficulties to

which he was so frequently reduced, and compare the sincerity of his

professions and declarations, we shall avow, that probity and honor ought

justly to be numbered among his most shining qualities. In every treaty,

those concessions which he thought he could not in conscience maintain, he

never could, by any motive or persuasion, be induced to make. And though

some violations of the petition of right may perhaps be imputed to him,

these are more to be ascribed to the necessity of his situation, and to

the lofty ideas of royal prerogative, which, from former established

precedents, he had imbibed, than to any failure in the integrity of his

principles.[*] 20
 

This prince was of a comely presence; of a sweet, but melancholy aspect.

His face was regular, handsome, and well complexioned; his body strong,

healthy, and justly proportioned; and being of a middle stature, he was

capable of enduring the greatest fatigues. He excelled in horsemanship and

other exercises; and he possessed all the exterior, as well as many of the

essential qualities which form an accomplished prince.

 

The tragical death of Charles begat a question, whether the people, in any

case, were entitled to judge and to punish their sovereign; and most men,

regarding chiefly the atrocious usurpation of the pretended judges, and

the merit of the virtuous prince who suffered, were inclined to condemn

the republican principle, as highly seditious and extravagant: but there

still were a few who, abstracting from the particular circumstances of

this case, were able to consider the question in general, and were

inclined to moderate, not contradict, the prevailing sentiment. Such might

have been their reasoning. If ever, on any occasion, it were laudable to

conceal truth from the populace, it must be confessed, that the doctrine

of resistance affords such an example; and that all speculative reasoners

ought to observe, with regard to this principle, the same cautious silence

which the laws, in every species of government, have ever prescribed to

themselves. Government is instituted in order to restrain the fury and

injustice of the people; and being always founded on opinion, not on

force, it is dangerous to weaken, by these speculations, the reverence

which the multitude owe to authority, and to instruct them beforehand,

that the case can ever happen when they may be freed from their duty of

allegiance. Or should it be found impossible to restrain the license of

human disquisitions, it must be acknowledged, that the doctrine of

obedience ought alone to be inculcated; and that the exceptions, which are

rare, ought seldom or never to be mentioned in popular reasonings and

discourses. Nor is there any danger that mankind, by this prudent reserve,

should universally degenerate into a state of abject servitude. When the

exception really occurs, even though it be not previously expected and

descanted on, it must, from its very nature, be so obvious and undisputed,

as to remove all doubt, and overpower the restraint, however great,

imposed by teaching the general doctrine of obedience. But between

resisting a prince and dethroning him, there is a wide interval; and the

abuses of power which can warrant the latter violence, are greater and

more enormous than those which will justify the former. History, however,

supplies us with examples even of this kind; and the reality of the

supposition, though for the future it ought ever to be little looked for,

must, by all candid inquirers, be acknowledged in the past. But between

dethroning a prince and punishing him, there is another very wide

interval; and it were not strange, if even men of the most enlarged

thought should question, whether human nature could ever, in any monarch,

reach that height of depravity, as to warrant, in revolted subjects, this

last act of extraordinary jurisdiction. That illusion, if it be an

illusion, which teaches us to pay a sacred regard to the persona of

princes, is so salutary, that to dissipate it by the formal trial and

punishment of a sovereign, will have more pernicious effects upon the

people, than the example of justice can be supposed to have a beneficial

influence upon princes, by checking their career of tyranny. It is

dangerous also, by these examples, to reduce princes to despair, or bring

matters to such extremities against persons endowed with great power as to

leave them no resource, but in the most violent and most sanguinary

counsels. This general position being established, it must, however, be

observed, that no reader, almost of any party or principle, was ever

shocked, when he read in ancient history, that the Roman senate voted

Nero, their absolute sovereign, to be a public enemy, and, even without

trial, condemned him to the severest and most ignominious punishment; a

punishment from which the meanest Roman citizen was, by the laws,

exempted. The crimes of that bloody tyrant are so enormous, that they

break through all rules; and extort a confession, that such a dethroned

prince is no longer superior to his people, and can no longer plead, in

his own defence, laws which were established for conducting the ordinary

course of administration. But when we pass from the case of Nero to that

of Charles, the great disproportion, or rather total contrariety, of

character immediately strikes us; and we stand astonished, that, among a

civilized people, so much virtue could ever meet with so fatal a

catastrophe. History, the great mistress of wisdom, furnishes examples of

all kinds; and every prudential, as well as moral precept, may be

authorized by those events which her enlarged mirror is able to present to

us. From the memorable revolutions which passed in England during this

period, we may naturally deduce the same useful lesson which Charles

himself, in his later years, inferred; that it is dangerous for princes,

even from the appearance of necessity, to assume more authority than the

laws have allowed them. But it must be confessed, that these events

furnish us with another instruction, no less natural and no less useful,

concerning the madness of the people, the furies of fanaticism, and the

danger of mercenary armies.

 

In order to close this part of British history, it is also necessary to

relate the dissolution of the monarchy in England: that event soon

followed upon the death of the monarch. When the peers met, on the day

appointed in their adjournment, they entered upon business, and sent down

some votes to the commons, of which the latter deigned not to take the

least notice. In a few days, the lower house passed a vote, that they

would make no more addresses to the house of peers nor receive any front

them; and that that house was useless and dangerous, and was therefore to

be abolished. A like vote passed with regard to the monarchy; and it is

remarkable, that Martin, a zealous republican, in the debate on this

question, confessed, that if they desired a king, the last was as proper

as any gentleman in England.[*] The commons ordered a new great seal to be

engraved, on which that assembly was represented, with this legend, “On

the first year of freedom, by God’s blessing, restored, 1648.” The forms

of all public business were changed, from the king’s name, to that of the

keepers of the liberties of England.[**] And it was declared high treason

to proclaim, or any otherwise acknowledge Charles Stuart, commonly called

prince of Wales.

 

The commons intended, it is said, to bind the princess Elizabeth

apprentice to a button-maker: the duke of Gloucester was to be taught some

other mechanical employment. But the former soon died; of grief, as is

supposed, for her father’s tragical end: the latter was, by Cromwell, sent

beyond sea.

 

The king’s statue, in the exchange, was thrown down; and on the pedestal

these words were inscribed: “Exit tyrannus, regum ultimus;” The tyrant is

gone, the last of the kings.

 

Duke Hamilton was tried by a new high court of justice, as earl of

Cambridge, in England; and condemned for treason. This sentence, which was

certainly hard, but which ought to save his memory from all imputations of

treachery to his master, was executed on a scaffold erected before

Westminster Hall. Lord Capel underwent the same fate. Both these noblemen

had escaped from prison, but were afterwards discovered and taken. To all

the solicitations of their friends for pardon, the generals and

parliamentary leaders still replied, that it was certainly the intention

of Providence they should suffer; since it had permitted them to fall into

the hands of their enemies, after they had once recovered their liberty.

 

The earl of Holland lost his life by a like sentence. Though of a polite

and courtly behavior, he died lamented by no party. His ingratitude to the

king, and his frequent changing of sides, were regarded as great stains on

his memory. The earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen, being condemned by the

same court, were pardoned by the commons.

 

The king left six children—three males: Charles, born in 1630;

James, duke of York, born in 1633; Henry, duke of Gloucester, born in

1641;—and three females: Mary, princess of Orange, born 1631;

Elizabeth, born 1635; and Henrietta, afterwards duchess of Orleans, born

at Exeter, 1644.

 

The archbishops of Canterbury in this reign were Abbot and Laud; the lord

keepers, Williams bishop of Lincoln, Lord Coventry, Lord Finch, Lord

Littleton, and Sir Richard Lane; the high admirals, the duke of Buckingham

and the earl of Northumberland; the treasurers, the earl of Marlborough,

the earl of Portland, Juxon bishop of London, and Lord Cottington; the

secretaries of state, Lord Conway, Sir Albertus Moreton, Coke, Sir Henry

Vane, Lord Falkland, Lord Digby, and Sir Edward Nicholas.

 

It may be expected that we should here mention the Icon BasilikÃ©, a work

published in the king’s name a few days after his execution. It seems

almost impossible, in the controverted parts of history, to say any thing

which will satisfy the zealots of both parties: but with regard to the

genuineness of that production, it is not easy for an historian to fix any

opinion which will be entirely to his own satisfaction. The proofs brought

to evince that this work is or is not the king’s, are so convincing, that

if an impartial reader peruse any one side apart,[*] he will think it

impossible that arguments could be produced, sufficient to counterbalance

so strong an evidence: and when he compares both sides, he will be some

time at a loss to fix any determination. Should an absolute suspense of

judgment be found difficult or disagreeable in so interesting a question,

I must confess, that I much incline to give the preference to the

arguments of the royalists. The testimonies which prove that performance

to be the king’s, are more numerous, certain, and direct, than those on

the other side. This is the case, even if we consider the external

evidence: but when we weigh the internal, derived from the style and

composition, there is no manner of comparison. These meditations resemble,

in elegance, purity, neatness, and simplicity, the genius of those

performances which we know with certainty to have flowed from the royal

pen; but are so unlike the bombast, perplexed, rhetorical, and corrupt

style of Dr. Gauden, to whom they are ascribed, that no human testimony

seems sufficient to convince us that he was the author. Yet all the

evidences which would rob the king of that honor, tend to prove that Dr.

Gauden had the merit of writing so fine a performance, and the infamy of

imposing it on the world for the king’s.

 

It is not easy to conceive the general compassion excited towards the

king, by the publishing, at so critical a juncture, a work so full of

piety, meekness, and humanity. Many have not scrupled to ascribe to that

book the subsequent restoration of the royal family. Milton compares its

effects to those which were wrought on the tumultuous Romans by Anthony’s

reading to them the will of CÃ¦sar. The Icon passed through fifty editions

in a twelvemonth; and, independent of the great interest taken in it by

the nation, as the supposed production of their murdered sovereign, it

must be acknowledged the best prose composition which, at the time of its

publication, was to be found in the English language.
