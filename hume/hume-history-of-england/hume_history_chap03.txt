THE freedom which England had so long enjoyed from the depredations of the

      Danes, seems to have proceeded, partly from the establishments which that

      piratical nation had obtained in the north of France, and which employed

      all then superfluous hands to people and maintain them; partly from the

      vigor and warlike spirit of a long race of English princes, who preserved

      the kingdom in a posture of defence, by sea and land, and either prevented

      or repelled every attempt of the invaders. But a new generation of men

      being now sprung up in the northern regions, who could no longer disburden

      themselves on Normandy, the English had reason to dread that the Danes

      would again visit an island to which they were invited, both by the memory

      of their past successes, and by the expectation of assistance from their

      countrymen, who, though long established in the kingdom, were not yet

      thoroughly incorporated with the natives, nor had entirely forgotten their

      inveterate habits of war and depredation. And as the reigning prince was a

      minor, and even when he attained to man’s estate, never discovered either

      courage or capacity sufficient to govern his own subjects, much less to

      repel a formidable enemy, the people might justly apprehend the worst

      calamities from so dangerous a crisis.

     

      981.

     

      The Danes, before they durst attempt any important enterprise against

      England, made an inconsiderable descent by way of trial; and having landed

      from seven vessels near Southamptom, they ravaged the country, enriched

      themselves by spoil, and departed with impunity. Six years after, they

      made a like attempt in the west, and met with like success. The invaders,

      having now found affairs in a very different situation from that in which

      they formerly appeared, encouraged their countrymen to assemble a greater

      force, and to hope for more considerable advantages.

     

      991

     

      They landed in Essex, under the command of two leaders; and having

      defeated and slain, at Maldon, Brithnot, duke of that county, who ventured

      with a small body to attack them, they spread their devastations over all

      the neighboring provinces. In this extremity, Ethelred, to whom historians

      give the epithet of the Unready, instead of rousing his people to

      defend with courage their honor and their property, hearkened to the

      advice of Siricius, archbishop of Canterbury, which was seconded by many

      of the degenerate nobility; and paying the enemy the sum of ten thousand

      pounds, he bribed them to depart the kingdom. This shameful expedient was

      attended with the success which might be expected. The Danes next year

      appeared off the eastern coast, in hopes of subduing a people who defended

      themselves by their money, which invited assailants, instead of their

      arms, which repelled them. But the English, sensible of their folly, had

      in the interval assembled in a great council, and had determined to

      collect at London a fleet able to give battle to the enemy;[*] though that

      judicious measure failed of success, from the treachery of Alfric, duke of

      Mercia, whose name is infamous in the annals of that age, by the

      calamities which his repeated perfidy brought upon his country. This

      nobleman had, in 983, succeeded to his father, Alfere, in that extensive

      command; but, being deprived of it two years after, and banished the

      kingdom, he was obliged to employ all his intrigue, and all his power,

      which was too great for a subject, to be restored to his country, and

      reinstated in his authority. Having had experience of the credit and

      malevolence of his enemies, he thenceforth trusted for security, not to

      his services, or to the affections of his fellow-citizens, but to the

      influence which he had obtained over his vassals, and to the public

      calamities, which he thought must, in every revolution, render his

      assistance necessary. Having fixed this resolution, he determined to

      prevent all such successes as might establish the royal authority, or

      render his own situation dependent or precarious. As the English had

      formed the plan of surrounding and destroying the Danish fleet in harbor,

      he privately informed the enemy of their danger; and when they put to sea,

      in consequence of this intelligence, he deserted to them, with the

      squadron under his command, the night before the engagement, and thereby

      disappointed all the efforts of his countrymen.[**] Ethelred, enraged at

      his perfidy, seized his son Alfgar, and ordered his eyes to be put

      out.[***]

     

      But such was the power of Alfric, that he again forced himself into

      authority; and though he had given this specimen of his character, and

      received this grievous provocation, it was found necessary to intrust him

      anew with the government of Mercia. This conduct of the court, which, in

      all its circumstances, is so barbarous, weak, and imprudent both merited

      and prognosticated the most grievous calamities.

     

      993.

     

      The northern invaders, now well acquainted with the defenceless condition

      of England, made a powerful descent under the command of Sweyn, king of

      Denmark, and Olave king of Norway; and sailing up the Humber, spread on

      all sides their destructive ravages. Lindesey was laid waste; Banbury was

      destroyed; and all the Northumbrians, though mostly of Danish descent,

      were constrained either to join the invaders, or to suffer under their

      depredations. A powerful army was assembled to oppose the Danes, and a

      general action ensued; but the English were deserted in the battle, from

      the cowardice or treachery of their three leaders, all of them men of

      Danish race, Frena, Frithegist, and Godwin, who gave the example of a

      shameful flight to the troops under their command.

     

      Encouraged by this success, and still more by the contempt which it

      inspired for their enemy, the pirates ventured to attack the centre of the

      kingdom; and entering the Thames in ninety-four vessels, laid siege to

      London, and threatened it with total destruction. But the citizens,

      alarmed at the danger, and firmly united among themselves, made a bolder

      defence than the cowardice of the nobility and gentry gave the invaders

      reason to apprehend; and the besiegers, after suffering the greatest

      hardships, were finally frustrated in their attempt. In order to revenge

      themselves, they laid waste Essex, Sussex, and Hampshire; and having there

      procured horses, they were thereby enabled to spread through the more

      inland counties the fury of their depredations. In this extremity,

      Ethelred and his nobles had recourse to the former expedient; and sending

      ambassadors to the two northern kings, they promised them subsistence and

      tribute, on condition they would, for the present, put an end to their

      ravages, and soon after depart the kingdom. Sweyn and Olave agreed to the

      terms, and peaceably took up their quarters at Southampton, where the sum

      of sixteen thousand pounds was paid to them. Olave even made a journey to

      Andover, where Ethelred resided; and he received the rite of confirmation

      from the English bishops, as well as many rich presents from the king. He

      here promised that he would never more infest the English territories; and

      he faithfully fulfilled the engagement. This prince receives the

      appellation of St. Olave from the church of Rome; and, notwithstanding the

      general presumption, which lies either against the understanding or morals

      of every one who in those ignorant ages was dignified with that title, he

      seems to have been a man of merit and of virtue, Sweyn, though less

      scrupulous than Olave, was constrained, upon the departure of the

      Norwegian prince, to evacuate also the kingdom, with all his followers.

     

      997.

     

      This composition brought only a short interval to the miseries of the

      English. The Danish pirates appeared soon after in the Severn; and having

      committed spoil in Wales, as well as in Cornwall and Devonshire, they

      sailed round to the south coast, and entering the Tamar, completed the

      devastation of these two counties. They then returned to the Bristol

      Channel; and penetrating into the country by the Avon, spread themselves

      over all that neighborhood, and carried fire and sword even into

      Dorsetshire. They next changed the seat of war; and after ravaging the

      Isle of Wight, they entered the Thames and Medway, and laid siege to

      Rochester, where they defeated the Kentish men in a pitched battle. After

      this victory, the whole province of Kent was made a scene of slaughter,

      fire, and devastation. The extremity of these miseries forced the English

      into counsels for common defence, both by sea and land; but the weakness

      of the king, the divisions among the nobility, the treachery of some, the

      cowardice of others, the want of concert in all, frustrated every

      endeavor; their fleets and armies either came too late to attack the

      enemy, or were repulsed with dishonor; and the people were thus equally

      ruined by resistance or by submission. The English, therefore, destitute

      both of prudence and unanimity in council, of courage and conduct in the

      field, had recourse to the same weak expedient which, by experience, they

      had already found so ineffectual: they offered the Danes to buy peace, by

      paying them a large sum of money, These ravagers rose continually in their

      demands; and now required the payment of twenty-four thousand pounds, to

      which the English were so mean and imprudent as to submit.[*]

     

      The departure of the Danes procured them another short interval of repose,

      which they enjoyed as if it were to be perpetual without making any

      effectual preparations for a more vigorous resistance upon the next return

      of the enemy.

     

      Besides receiving this sum, the Danes were engaged by another motive to

      depart a kingdom which appeared so little in a situation to resist their

      efforts. They were invited over by their countrymen in Normandy, who at

      this time were hard pressed by the arms of Robert, king of France, and who

      found it difficult to defend the settlement, which, with so much advantage

      to themselves, and glory to their nation, they had made in that country.

      It is probable, also, that Ethelred, observing the close connections thus

      maintained among all the Danes, however divided in government or

      situation, was desirous of forming an alliance with that formidable

      people. For this purpose, being now a widower, he made his addresses to

      Emma, sister to Richard II., duke of Normandy, and he soon succeeded in

      his negotiation. The princess came over this year

     

      1001.

     

      to England, and was married to Ethelred.[*]

     

      In the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth century—when the

      north, not yet exhausted by that multitude of people, or rather nations,

      which she had successively emitted, sent forth a new race, not of

      conquerors, as before, but of pirates and ravagers, who infested the

      countries possessed by her once warlike sons—lived Rollo, a petty

      prince or chieftain in Denmark, whose valor and abilities soon en gaged,

      the attention of his countrymen. He was exposed in his youth to the

      jealousy of the king of Denmark, who attacked his small but independent

      principality, and who, being foiled in every assault, had recourse at last

      to perfidy for effecting his purpose, which he had often attempted in vain

      by force of arms.[**]

     

      He lulled Rollo into security by an insidious peace and falling suddenly

      upon him, murdered his brother and his bravest officers, and forced him to

      fly for safety into Scandinavia. Here many of his ancient subjects,

      induced partly by affection to their prince, partly by the oppressions of

      the Danish monarch, ranged themselves under his standard, and offered to

      follow him in every enterprise. Rollo, instead of attempting to recover

      his paternal dominions, where he must expect a vigorous resistance from

      the Danes, determined to pursue an easier but more important undertaking,

      and to make rus fortune, in imitation of his countrymen, by pillaging the

      richer and more southern coasts of Europe. He collected a body of troops,

      which, like that of all those ravagers, was composed of Norwegians,

      Swedes, Frisians, Danes, and adventurers of all nations, who being

      accustomed to a roving, unsettled life, took delight in nothing but war

      and plunder. His reputation brought him associates from all quarters; and

      a vision, which he pretended to have appeared to him in his sleep, and

      which, according to his interpretation of it, prognosticated the greatest

      successes, proved also a powerful incentive with those ignorant and

      superstitious people.[*]

     

      The first attempt made by Rollo was on England, near the end of Alfred’s

      reign, when that great monarch, having settled Guthrum and his followers

      in East Anglia, and others of those freebooters in Northumberland, and

      having restored peace to his harassed country, had established the most

      excellent military, as well as civil, institutions among the English. The

      prudent Dane, finding that no advantages could be gained over such a

      people, governed by such a prince, soon turned his enterprises against

      France, which he found more exposed to his inroads;[**] and during the

      reigns of Eudes, a usurper, and of Charles the Simple, a weak prince, he

      committed the most destructive ravages, both on the inland and maritime

      provinces of that kingdom. The French, having no means of defence against

      a leader who united all the valor of his countrymen with the policy of

      more civilized nations, were obliged to submit to the expedient practised

      by Alfred, and to offer the invaders a settlement in some of those

      provinces which they had depopulated by their arms.[***]

     

      The reason why the Danes, for many years, pursued measures so different

      from those which had been embraced by the Goths, Vandals, Franks,

      Burgundians, Lombards, and other northern conquerors, was the great

      difference in the method of attack which was practised by these several

      nations, and to which the nature of their respective situations

      necessarily confined them. The latter tribes, living in an inland country,

      made incursions by land upon the Roman empire; and when they entered far

      into the frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them their wives

      and families, whom they had no hopes of soon revisiting, and who could not

      otherwise participate of their plunder. This circumstance quickly made

      them think of forcing a settlement in the provinces which they had

      overrun: and these barbarians, spreading themselves over the country,

      found an interest in protecting the property and industry of the people

      whom they had subdued. But the Danes and Norwegians, invited by their

      maritime situation, and obliged to maintain themselves in their

      uncultivated country by fishing, had acquired some experience of

      navigation; and, in their military excursions, pursued the method

      practised against the Roman empire by the more early Saxons. They made

      descents in small bodies from their ships, or rather boats, and ravaging

      the coasts, returned with the booty to their families, whom they could not

      conveniently carry along with them in those hazardous enterprises. But

      when they increased their armaments, made incursions into the inland

      countries, and found it safe to remain longer in the midst of the

      enfeebled enemy, they had been accustomed to crowd their vessels with

      their wives and children, and having no longer any temptation to return to

      their own country, they willingly embraced an opportunity of settling in

      the warm climates and cultivated fields of the south.

     

      Affairs were in this situation with Rollo and his followers, when Charles

      proposed to relinquish to them part of the province formerly called

      Neustria, and to purchase peace on these hard conditions. After all the

      terms were fully settled, there appeared only one circumstance shocking to

      the haughty Dane: he was required to do homage to Charles for this

      province, and to put himself in that humiliating posture imposed on

      vassals by the rites of the feudal law. He long refused to submit to this

      indignity; but, being unwilling to lose such important advantages for a

      mere ceremony, he made a sacrifice of his pride to his interest, and

      acknowledged himself, in form, the vassal of the French monarch.[*]

      Charles gave him his daughter Gisla in marriage; and, that he might bind

      him faster to his interests, made him a donation of a considerable

      territory, besides that which he was obliged to surrender to him by his

      stipulation.

     

      When some of the French nobles informed him that, in return for so

      generous a present, it was expected that he should throw himself at the

      king’s feet, and make suitable acknowledgments for his bounty, Rollo

      replied, that he would rather decline the present; and it was with some

      difficulty they could persuade him to make that compliment by one of his

      captains. The Dane, commissioned for this purpose, full of indignation at

      the order, and despising so unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the

      foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he might kiss it,

      overthrew him before all his courtiers. The French, sensible of their

      present weakness, found it prudent to overlook this insult.[*]

     

      Rollo, who was now in the decline of life, and was tired of wars and

      depredations, applied himself, with mature counsels to the settlement of

      his new-acquired territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy; and he

      parcelled it out among his captains and followers. He followed, in this

      partition, the customs of the feudal law, which was then universally

      established in the southern countries of Europe, and which suited the

      peculiar circumstances of that age. He treated the French subjects, who

      submitted to him, with mildness and justice; he reclaimed his ancient

      followers from their ferocious violence; he established law and order

      throughout his state; and after a life spent in tumults and ravages, he

      died peaceably in a good old age, and left his dominions to his

      posterity.[**]

     

      William I., who succeeded him, governed the duchy twenty-five years; and,

      during that time, the Normans, who were thoroughly intermingled with the

      French, had acquired their language, had imitated their manners, and had

      made such progress towards cultivation, that, on the death of William, his

      son Richard, though a minor,[***] inherited his dominions; a sure proof

      that the Normans were already somewhat advanced in civility, and that

      their government could now rest secure on its laws and civil institutions,

      and was not wholly sustained by the abilities of the sovereign. Richard,

      after a long reign of fifty-four years, was succeeded by his son, of the

      same name, in the year 996,[****] which was eighty-five years after the

      first establishment of the Normans in France. This was the duke who gave

      his sister Emma in marriage to Ethelred, king of England, and who thereby

      formed connections with a country which his posterity was so soon after

      destined to subdue.

     

      The Danes had been established during a longer period in England than in

      France; and though the similarity of their original language to that of

      the Saxons invited them to a more early coalition with the natives, they

      had hitherto found so little example of civilized manners among the

      English, that they retained all their ancient ferocity, and valued

      themselves only on their national character of military bravery. The

      recent, as well as more ancient achievements of their countrymen tended to

      support this idea; and the English princes particularly Athelstan and

      Edgar, sensible of that superiority had been accustomed to keep in pay

      bodies of Danish troops, who were quartered about the country, and

      committed many violences upon the inhabitants. These mercenaries had

      attained to such a height of luxury, according to the old English

      writers,[*] that they combed their hair once a day, bathed themselves once

      a week, changed their clothes frequently; and by all these arts of

      effeminacy, as well as by their military character, had rendered

      themselves so agreeable to the fair sex, that they debauched the wives and

      daughters of the English, and dishonored many families. But what most

      provoked the inhabitants was, that instead of defending them against

      invaders, they were ever ready to betray them to the foreign Danes, and to

      associate themselves with all straggling parties of that nation.

     

      The animosity between the inhabitants of English and Danish race, had,

      from these repeated injuries, risen to a great height, when Ethelred, from

      a policy incident to weak princes embraced the cruel resolution of

      massacring the latter throughout all his dominions.[**] 4
 

      1002.

     

      Secret orders were despatched to commence the execution every where on the

      same day, and the festival of St. Brice, which fell on a Sunday, [November

      13,] the day on which the Danes usually bathed themselves, was chosen for

      that purpose. It is needless to repeat the accounts transmitted concerning

      the barbarity of this massacre: the rage of the populace, excited by so

      many injuries, sanctioned by authority, and stimulated by example,

      distinguished not between innocence and guilt, spared neither sex nor age,

      and was not satiated without the tortures as well as death of the unhappy

      victims. Even Gunilda, sister to the king of Denmark, who had married Earl

      Paling, and had embraced Christianity, was, by the advice of Edric, earl

      of Wilts, seized and condemned to death by Ethelred, after seeing her

      husband and children butchered before her face. This unhappy princess

      foretold, in the agonies of despair, that her murder would soon be avenged

      by the total ruin of the English nation.

     

      1003.

     

      Never was prophecy better fulfilled; and never did barbarous policy prove

      more fatal to the authors. Sweyn and his Danes, who wanted but a pretence

      for invading the English, appeared off the western coast, and threatened

      to take full revenge for the slaughter of their countrymen. Exeter fell

      first into their hands, from the negligence or treachery of Earl Hugh, a

      Norman, who had been made governor by the interest of Queen Emma. They

      began to spread their devastations over the country, when the English,

      sensible what outrages they must now expect from their barbarous and

      offended enemy, assembled more early, and in greater numbers than usual,

      and made an appearance of vigorous resistance. But all these preparations

      were frustrated by the treachery of Duke Alfric, who was intrusted with

      the command, and who, feigning sickness, refused to lead the army against

      the Danes, till it was dispirited, and at last dissipated, by his fatal

      misconduct. Alfric soon after died, and Edric, a greater traitor than he,

      who had married the king’s daughter, and had acquired a total ascendant

      over him, succeeded Alfric in the government of Mercia, and in the command

      of the English armies. A great famine, proceeding partly from the bad

      seasons, partly from the decay of agriculture, added to all the other

      miseries of the inhabitants.

     

      1007

     

      The country, wasted by the Danes, harassed by the fruitless expeditions of

      its own forces, was reduced to the utmost desolation, and at last

      submitted to the infamy of purchasing a precarious peace from the enemy,

      by the payment of thirty thousand pounds.

     

      The English endeavored to employ this interval in making preparations

      against the return of the Danes, which they had reason soon to expect. A

      law was made, ordering the proprietors of eight hides of land to provide

      each a horseman and a complete suit of armor, and those of three hundred

      and ten hides to equip a ship for the defence of the coast. When this navy

      was assembled, which must have consisted of near eight hundred vessels,[*]

      all hopes of its success were disappointed by the factions, animosities,

      and dissensions of the nobility. Edric had impelled his brother Brightric

      to prefer an accusation of treason against Wolfnoth, governor of Sussex,

      the father of the famous Earl Godwin; and that nobleman, well acquainted

      with the malevolence as well as power of his enemy, found no means of

      safety Dut in deserting with twenty ships to the Danes.

     

      Brightric pursued him with a fleet of eighty sail; but his ships being

      shattered in a tempest, and stranded on the coast, he was suddenly

      attacked by Wolfnoth, and all his vessels burnt and destroyed. The

      imbecility of the king was little capable of repairing this misfortune.

      The treachery of Edric frustrated every plan for future defence; and the

      English navy, disconcerted, discouraged, and divided, was at last

      scattered into its several harbors.

     

      It is almost impossible, or would be tedious, to relate particularly all

      the miseries to which the English were henceforth exposed. We hear of

      nothing but the sacking and burning of towns; the devastation of the open

      country; the appearance of the enemy in every quarter of the kingdom;

      their cruel diligence in discovering any corner which had not been

      ransacked by their former violence. The broken and disjointed narration of

      the ancient historians is here well adapted to the nature of the war,

      which was conducted by such sudden inroads, as would have been dangerous

      even to a united and well-governed kingdom, but proved fatal where nothing

      but a general consternation and mutual diffidence and dissension

      prevailed. The governors of one province refused to march to the

      assistance of another, and were at last terrified from assembling their

      forces for the defence of their own province. General councils were

      summoned; but either no resolution was taken, or none was carried into

      execution. And the only expedient in which the English agreed, was the

      base and imprudent one of buying a new peace from the Danes, by the

      payment of forty-eight thousand pounds.

     

      1011.

     

      This measure did not bring them even that short interval of repose which

      they had expected from it. The Danes, disregarding all engagements,

      continued their devastations and hostilities; levied a new contribution of

      eight thousand pounds upon the county of Kent alone; murdered the

      archbishop of Canterbury, who had refused to countenance this exaction;

      and the English nobility found no other resource than that of submitting

      everywhere to the Danish monarch, swearing allegiance to him, and

      delivering him hostages for their fidelity. Ethelred equally afraid of the

      violence of the enemy, and the treachery of his own subjects, fled into

      Normandy,

     

      1013

     

      whither he had sent before him Queen Emma, and her two sons, Alfred and

      Edward. Richard received his unhappy guests with a generosity that does

      honor to his memory.

     

      1014

     

      The king had not been above six weeks in Normandy, when he heard of the

      death of Sweyn, who expired at Gainsborough, before he had time to

      establish himself in his new-acquired dominions. The English prelates and

      nobility, taking advantage of this event, sent over a deputation to

      Normandy, inviting Ethelred to return to them, expressing a desire of

      being again governed by their native prince, and intimating their hopes

      that, being now tutored by experience, he would avoid all those errors

      which had been attended with such misfortunes to himself and to his

      people. But the misconduct of Ethelred was incurable; and on his resuming

      the government, he discovered the same incapacity, indolence, cowardice,

      and credulity, which had so often exposed him to the insults of his

      enemies. His son-in-law Edric, notwithstanding his repeated treasons,

      retained such influence at court, as to instil into the king jealousies of

      Sigefert and Morcar, two of the chief nobles of Mercia. Edric allured them

      into his house, where he murdered them; while Ethelred participated in the

      infamy of the action, by confiscating their estates, and thrusting into a

      convent the widow of Sigefert. She was a woman of singular beauty and

      merit; and in a visit which was paid her, during her confinement, by

      Prince Edmond, the king’s eldest son, she inspired him with so violent an

      affection, that he released her from the convent, and soon after married

      her, without the consent of his father.

     

      Meanwhile the English found in Canute, the son and successor of Sweyn, an

      enemy no less terrible than the prince from whom death had so lately

      delivered them. He ravaged the eastern coast with merciless fury, and put

      ashore all the English hostages at Sandwich, after having cut off their

      hands and noses. He was obliged, by the necessity of his affairs, to make

      a voyage to Denmark; but, returning soon after, he continued his

      depredations along the southern coast He even broke into the counties of

      Dorset, Wilts, and Somerset where an army was assembled against him, under

      the command of Prince Edmond and Duke Edric. The latter still continued

      his perfidious machinations, and after endeavoring in vain to got the

      prince into his power, he found means to disperse the army, and he then

      openly deserted to Canute with forty vessels.

     

      1015.

     

      Notwithstanding this misfortune, Edmond was not disconcerted; but

      assembling all the force of England, was in a condition to give battle to

      the enemy. The king had had such frequent experience of perfidy among his

      subjects, that he had lost all confidence in them: he remained at London,

      pretending sickness, but really from apprehensions that they intended to

      buy their peace, by delivering him into the hands of his enemies. The army

      called aloud for their sovereign to march at their head against the Danes;

      and, on his refusal to take the field, they were so discouraged, that

      those vast preparations became ineffectual for the defence of the kingdom.

      Edmond, deprived of all regular supplies to maintain his soldiers, was

      obliged to commit equal ravages with those which were practised by the

      Danes; and, after making some fruitless expeditions into the north, which

      had submitted entirely to Canute’s power, he retired to London, determined

      there to maintain to the last extremity the small remains of English

      liberty. He here found every thing in confusion by the death of the king,

      who expired after an unhappy and inglorious reign of thirty-five years.

     

      1016.

     

      He left two sons by his first marriage, Edmond, who succeeded him, and

      Edwy, whom Canute afterwards murdered. His two sons by the second

      marriage, Anred and Edward, were, immediately upon Ethelred’s death,

      conveyed into Normandy by Queen Emma.

     

 
 

      This prince, who received the name of Ironside from his hardy

      valor, possessed courage and abilities sufficient to have prevented his

      country from sinking into those calamities, but not to raise it from that

      abyss of misery into which it had already fallen. Among the other

      misfortunes of the English, treachery and disaffection had crept in among

      the nobility and prelates; and Edmond found no better expedient for

      stopping the further progress of these fatal evils, than to lead his army

      instantly into the field, and to employ them against the common enemy.

      After meeting with some success at Gillingnam, he prepared himself to

      decide, in one general engagement, the fate of his crown: and at

      Scoerston, in the county of Glocester, he offered battle to the enemy, who

      were commanded by Canute and Edric. Fortune, in the beginning of the day,

      declared for him; but Edric, having cut off the head of one Osmer, whose

      countenance resembled that of Edmond fixed it on a spear, carried it

      through the ranks in triumph, and called aloud to the English, that it was

      time to fly; for, behold! the head of their sovereign. And though Edmond,

      observing the consternation of the troops, took off his helmet, and showed

      himself to them, the utmost he could gain by his activity and valor was to

      leave the victory undecided. Edric now took a surer method to ruin him, by

      pretending to desert to him; and as Edmond was well acquainted with his

      power, and probably knew no other of the chief nobility in whom he could

      repose more confidence, he was obliged, notwithstanding the repeated

      perfidy of the man, to give him a considerable command in the army. A

      battle soon after ensued at Assington, in Essex; where Edric, flying in

      the beginning of the day, occasioned the total defeat of the English,

      followed by a great slaughter of the nobility. The indefatigable Edmond,

      however, had still resources. Assembling a new army at Glocester, he was

      again in condition to dispute the field; when the Danish and English

      nobility, equally harassed with those convulsions obliged their kings to

      come to a compromise, and to divide the kingdom between them by treaty.

      Canute reserved to himself the northern division, consisting of Mercia,

      East Anglia, and Northumberland, which he had entirely subdued. The

      southern parts were left to Edmond. The prince survived the treaty about a

      month. He was murdered at Oxford by two of his chamberlains, accomplices

      of Edric, who thereby made way for the succession of Canute the Dane to

      the crown of England.

     

 
 

      1017.

     

      The English, who had been unable to defend their country, and maintain

      their independency, under so active and brave a prince as Edmond, could

      after his death expect nothing but total subjection from Canute, who,

      active and brave himself, and at the head of a great force, was ready to

      take advantage of the minority of Edwin and Edward, the two sons of

      Edmond. Yet this conqueror, who was commonly so little scrupulous, showed

      himself anxious to cover his injustice under plausible pretences. Before

      he seized the dominions of the English princes, he summoned a general

      assembly of the states, in order to fix the succession of the kingdom. He

      here suborned some nobles to depose that, in the treaty of Glocester it

      had been verbally agreed, either to name Canute, in case of Edmond’s

      death, successor to his dominions, or tutor to hit children, (for

      historians vary in this particular;) and that evidence, supported by the

      great power of Canute, determined the states immediately to put the Danish

      monarch in possession of the government. Canute, jealous of the two

      princes, but sensible that he should render himself extremely odious if he

      ordered them to be despatched in England, sent them abroad to his ally,

      the king of Sweden, whom he desired, as soon as they arrived at his court,

      to free him, by their death, from a& farther anxiety. The Swedish

      monarch was too generous to comply with the request; but being afraid of

      drawing on himself a quarrel with Canute, by protecting the young princes,

      he sent them to Solomon, king of Hungary, to be educated in his court. The

      elder, Edwin, was afterwards married to the sister of the king of Hungary;

      but the English prince dying without issue, Solomon gave his

      sister-in-law, Agatha, daughter of the emperor Henry the Second, in

      marriage to Edward, the younger brother; and she bore him Edgar, Atheling,

      Margaret, afterwards queen of Scotland, and Christina, who retired into a

      convent.

     

      Canute, though he had reached the great point of his ambition in obtaining

      possession of the English crown, was obliged at first to make great

      sacrifices to it; and to gratify the chief of the nobility, by bestowing

      on them the most extensive governments and jurisdictions. He created

      Thurkill earl or duke of East Anglia, (for these titles were then nearly

      of the same import,) Yric of Northumberland, and Edric of Mercia;

      reserving only to himself the administration of Wessex. But seizing

      afterwards a favorable opportunity, he expelled Thurkill and Yric from

      their governments, and banished them the kingdom; he put to death many of

      the English nobility, on whose fidelity he could not rely, and whom he

      hated on account of their disloyalty to their native prince. And even the

      traitor Edric, having had the assurance to reproach him with his services,

      was condemned to be executed, and his body to be thrown into the Thames; a

      suitable reward for his multiplied acts of perfidy and rebellion.

     

      Canute also found himself obliged, in the beginning of his reign, to load

      the people with heavy taxes, in order to reward his Danish followers: he

      exacted from them at one time the sum of seventy-two thousand pounds;

      besides eleven thousand pounds which he levied on London alone. He was

      probably willing, from political motives, to mulct severely that city, on

      account of the affection which it had borne to Edmond, and the resistance

      which it had made to the Danish power in two obstinate sieges.[*] But

      these rigors were imputed to necessity, and Canute, like a wise prince,

      was determined that the English, now deprived of all their dangerous

      leaders, should be reconciled to the Danish yoke, by the justice and

      impartiality of his administration. He sent back to Denmark as many of his

      followers as he could safely spare; he restored the Saxon customs in a

      general assembly of the states; he made no distinction between Danes and

      English in the distribution of justice; and he took care, by a strict

      execution of law, to protect the lives and properties of all his people.

      The Danes were gradually incorporated with his new objects; and both were

      glad to obtain a little respite from those multiplied calamities, from

      which the one, no less than the other, had, in their fierce contest for

      power, experienced such fatal consequences.

     

      The removal of Edmond’s children into so distant a country as Hungary,

      was, next to their death, regarded by Canute as the greatest security to

      his government: he had no further anxiety, except with regard to Alfred

      and Edward, who were protected and supported by their uncle Richard, duke

      of Normandy. Richard even fitted out a great armament, in order to restore

      the English princes to the throne of their ancestors; and though the navy

      was dispersed by a storm, Canute saw the danger to which he was exposed,

      from the enmity of so warlike a people as the Normans. In order to acquire

      the friendship of the duke, he paid his addresses to Queen Emma, sister of

      that prince; and promised that he would leave the children, whom he should

      have by that marriage, in possession of the crown of England. Richard

      complied with his demand, and sent over Emma to England, where she was

      soon after married to Canute.[**] The English, though they disapproved of

      her espousing the mortal enemy of her former husband and his family, were

      pleased to find at court a sovereign to whom they were accustomed, and who

      had already formed connections with them; and thus Canute besides

      securing, by this marriage, the alliance of Normandy gradually acquired,

      by the same means, the confidence of his own subjects.[***] The Norman

      prince did not long survive the marriage of Emma; and he left the

      inheritance of the duchy to his eldest son of the same name; who, dying a

      year after him without children, was succeeded by his brother Robert, a

      man of valor and abilities.

     

      Canute, having settled his power in England beyond all danger of a

      revolution, made a voyage to Denmark, in order to resist the attacks of

      the king of Sweden; and he carried along with him a great body of the

      English, under the command of Earl Godwin. This nobleman had here an

      opportunity of performing a service, by which he both reconciled the

      king’s mind to the English nation, and gaining to himself the friendship

      of his sovereign, laid the foundation of that immense fortune which he

      acquired to his family. He was stationed next the Swedish camp, and

      observing a favorable opportunity, which he was obliged suddenly to seize,

      he Attacked the enemy in the night, drove them from their trenches, threw

      them into disorder, pursued his advantage, and obtained a decisive victory

      over them. Next morning, Canute, seeing the English camp entirely

      abandoned, imagined that those disaffected troops had deserted to the

      enemy: he was agreeably surprised to find that they were at that time

      engaged in pursuit of the discomfited Swedes. He was so pleased with this

      success, and with the manner of obtaining it that he bestowed his daughter

      in marriage upon Godwin, and treated him ever after with entire confidence

      and regard.

     

      1028.

     

      In another voyage, which he made afterwards to Denmark, Canute attacked

      Norway, and expelling the just but unwarlike Olaus, kept possession of his

      kingdom till the death of that prince. He had now by his conquests and

      valor attained the utmost height of grandeur: having leisure from wars and

      intrigues, he felt the unsatisfactory nature of all human enjoyments; and

      equally weary of the glories and turmoils of this life, he began to cast

      his view towards that future existence, which it is so natural for the

      human mind, whether satiated by prosperity or disgusted with adversity, to

      make the object of its attention. Unfortunately, the spirit which

      prevailed in that age gave a wrong direction to his devotion: instead of

      making compensation to those whom he had injured by his former acts of

      violence, he employed himself entirely in those exercises of piety which

      the monks represented as the most meritorious. He built churches, he

      endowed monasteries, he enriched the ecclesiastics, and he bestowed

      revenues for the support of chantries at Assington and other places; where

      he appointed prayers to be said for the souls of those who had there

      fallen in battle against him. He even undertook a pilgrimage to Rome,

      where he resided a considerable time: besides obtaining from the pope some

      privileges for the English school erected there, he engaged all the

      princes, through whose dominions he was obliged to pass, to desist from

      those heavy impositions and tolls which they were accustomed to exact from

      the English pilgrims. By this spirit of devotion no less than by his

      equitable and politic administration, he gained, in a good measure, the

      affections of his subjects.

     

      Canute, the greatest and most powerful monarch of his time, sovereign of

      Denmark and Norway, as well as of England, could not fail of meeting with

      adulation from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally paid even to

      the meanest and weakest princes. Some of his flatterers breaking out one

      day in admiration of his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was possible

      for him; upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered his chair to be set

      on the sea-shore, while the tide was rising; and as the waters approached,

      he commanded them to retire, and to obey the voice of him who was lord of

      the ocean. He feigned to sit some time in expectation of their submission;

      but when the sea still advanced towards him, and began to wash him with

      its billows, he turned to his courtiers, and remarked to them, that every

      creature in the universe was feeble and impotent, and that power resided

      with one being alone, in whose hands were all the elements of nature; who

      could say to the ocean, “Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther;” and who

      could level with his nod the most towering piles of human pride and

      ambition.

     

      1031.

     

      The only memorable action which Canute performed after his return from

      Rome, was an expedition against Malcolm, king of Scotland. During the

      reign of Ethelred, a tax of a shilling a hide had been imposed on all the

      lands of England. It was commonly called ‘danegelt;’ because the revenue

      bar been employed either in buying peace with the Danes, or in making

      preparations against the inroads of that hostile nation. That monarch had

      required that the same tax should be paid by Cumberland, which was held by

      the Scots; but Malcolm a warlike prince, told him, that as he was always

      able to repulse the Danes by his own power, he would neither submit to buy

      peace of his enemies, nor pay others for resisting them. Ethelred,

      offended at this reply, which contained a secret reproach on his own

      conduct, undertook an expedition against Cumberland; but though he

      committed ravages upon the country, he could never bring Malcolm to a

      temper more humble or submissive. Canute, after his accession, summoned

      the Scottish king to acknowledge himself a vassal for Cumberland to the

      crown of England; but Malcolm refused compliance, on pretence that he owed

      homage to those princes only who inherited that kingdom by right of blood.

      Canute was not of a temper to bear this insult; and the king of Scotland

      soon found, that the sceptre was in very different hands from those of the

      feeble and irresolute Ethelred. Upon Canute’s appearing on the frontiers

      with a formidable army Malcolm agreed that his grandson and heir, Duncan,

      whom he put in possession of Cumberland, should make the submissions

      required, and that the heirs of Scotland should always acknowledge

      themselves vassals to England for that province.[*] Canute passed four

      years in peace after this enterprise, and he died at Shaftesbury;[**]

      leaving three sons, Sweyn, Harold, and Hardicanute. Sweyn, whom he had by

      his first marriage with Alfwen, daughter of the earl of Hampshire, was

      crowned in Norway: Hardicanute, whom Emma had borne him, was in possession

      of Denmark: Harold, who was of the same marriage with Sweyn, was at that

      time in England.

     

 
 

      1035.

     

      Though Canute, in his treaty with Richard, duke of Normandy, had

      stipulated that his children by Emma should succeed to the crown of

      England, he had either considered himself as released from that engagement

      by the death of Richard, or esteemed it dangerous to leave an unsettled

      and newly-conquered kingdom in the hands of so young a prince as

      Hardicanute: he therefore appointed, by his will, Harold successor to the

      crown. This prince was besides present, to maintain his claim; he was

      favored by all the Danes; and he got immediately possession of his

      father’s treasures, which might be equally useful, whether he found it

      necessary to proceed by force or intrigue, in insuring his succession. On

      the other hand, Hardicanute had the suffrages of the English, who, on

      account of his being from among them of Queen Emma, regarded him as their

      countryman; he was favored by the articles of treaty with the duke of

      Normandy; and above all, his party was espoused by Earl Godwin, the most

      powerful nobleman in the kingdom, especially in the province of Wessex,

      the chief seat of the ancient English. Affairs were likely to terminate in

      a civil war; when, by the interposition of the nobility of both parties, a

      compromise was made; and it was agreed that Harold should enjoy, together

      with London, all the provinces north of the Thames, while the possession

      of the south should remain to Hardicanute: and till that prince should

      appear and take possession of his dominions, Emma fixed her residence at

      Winchester, and established her authority over her son’s share of the

      partition.

     

      Meanwhile Robert, duke of Normandy, died in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land,

      and being succeeded by a son, yet a minor, the two English princes, Alfred

      and Edward, who found no longer any countenance or protection in that

      country, gladly embraced the opportunity of paying a visit, with a

      numerous retinue, to their mother, Emma, who seemed to be placed in a

      state of so much power and splendor at Winchester. But the face of affairs

      soon wore a melancholy aspect. Earl Godwin had been gained by the arts of

      Harold, who promised to espouse the daughter of that nobleman; and while

      the treaty was yet a secret, these two tyrants laid a plan for the

      destruction of the English princes. Alfred was invited to London by Harold

      with many professions of friendship; but when he had reached Guilford, he

      was set upon by Godwin’s vassals, about six hundred of his train were

      murdered in the most cruel manner, he himself was taken prisoner, his eyes

      were put out, and he was conducted to the monastery of Ely, where he died

      soon after.[*] Edward and Emma, apprised of the fate which was awaiting

      them, fled beyond sea, the former into Normandy, the latter into Flanders;

      while Harold, triumphing in his bloody policy, took possession, without

      resistance, of all the dominions assigned to his brother.

     

      This is the only memorable action performed, during a reign of four years,

      by this prince, who gave so bad a specimen of his character, and whose

      bodily accomplishments alone are known to us by his appellation of Harefoot,

      which he acquired from his agility in running and walking. He died on the

      14th of April, 1039, little regretted or esteemed by his subjects, and

      left the succession open to his brother Hardicanute.

     

 
 

      1039.

     

      Hardicanute, or Canute the hardy, that is, the robust, (for he top is

      chiefly known by his bodily accomplishments,) though, by remaining so long

      in Denmark, he had been deprived of his share in the partition of the

      kingdom, had not abandoned his pretensions; and he had determined, before

      Harold’s death, to recover by arms what he had lost, either by his own

      negligence or by the necessity of his affairs. On pretence of paying a

      visit to the queen dowager in Flanders, ne had assembled a fleet of sixty

      sail, and was preparing to make a descent on England, when intelligence of

      his brother’s death induced him to sail immediately to London, where he

      was received in triumph, and acknowledged king without opposition.

     

      The first act of Hardicanute’s government afforded his subjects a bad

      prognostic of his future conduct. He was so enraged at Harold for

      depriving him of his share of the kingdom, and for the cruel treatment of

      his brother Alfred, that in an impotent desire of revenge against the

      dead, he ordered his body to be dug up, and to be thrown into the Thames;

      and when it was found by some fishermen, and buried in London, he ordered

      it again to be dug up, and to be thrown again into the river; but it was

      fished up a second time, and then interred with great secrecy. Godwin,

      equally servile and insolent, submitted to be his instrument in this

      unnatural and brutal action.

     

      That nobleman knew that he was universally believed to have been an

      accomplice in the barbarity exercised on Alfred, and that he was on that

      account obnoxious to Hardicanute; and perhaps he hoped, by displaying this

      rage against Harold’s memory, to justify himself from having had any

      participation in his counsels. But Prince Edward, being invited over by

      the king, immediately on his appearance preferred an accusation against

      Godwin for the murder of Alfred, and demanded justice for that crime.

      Godwin, in order to appease the king; made him a magnificent present of a

      galley with a gilt stern, rowed by fourscore men, who wore each of them a

      gold bracelet on his arm, weighing sixteen ounces, and were armed and

      clothed in the most sumptuous manner. Hardicanute, pleased with the

      splendor of this spectacle, quickly forgot his brother’s murder; and on

      Godwin’s swearing that he was innocent of the crime, he allowed him to be

      acquitted.

     

      Though Hardicanute before his accession had been called over by the vows

      of the English, he soon lost the affections of the nation by his

      misconduct; but nothing appeared more grievous to them than his renewing

      the imposition of danegelt, and obliging the nation to pay a great sum of

      money to the fleet which brought him from Denmark. The discontents ran

      high in many places: in Worcester the populace rose, and put to death two

      of the collectors. The king, enraged at this opposition, swore vengeance

      against the city, and ordered three noblemen, Godwin, duke of Wessex,

      Siward, duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of Mercia, to execute

      his menaces with the utmost rigor. They were obliged to set fire to the

      city, and deliver it up to be plundered by their soldiers; but they saved

      the lives of the inhabitants, whom they confined in a small island of the

      Severn, called Beverey, till, by their intercession, they were able to

      appease the king, and obtain the pardon of the supplicants.

     

      This violent government was of short duration. Hardicanute died in two

      years after his accession, at the nuptials of a Danish lord, which he had

      honored with his presence. His usual habits of intemperance were so well

      known, that, notwithstanding his robust constitution, his sudden death

      gave as little surprise as it did sorrow to his subjects.

     

 
 

      1041.

     

      The English, on the death of Hardicanute, saw a favorable opportunity for

      recovering their liberty, and for shaking off the Danish yoke, under which

      they had so long labored. Sweyn, king of Norway, the eldest son of Canute,

      was absent; and as the two last kings had died without issue, none of that

      race presented himself, nor any whom the Danes could support as successor

      to the throne. Prince Edward was fortunately at court on his brother’s

      demise; and though the descendants of Edmond Ironside were the true heirs

      of the Saxon family, yet their absence in so remote a country as Hungary,

      appeared a sufficient reason for their exclusion to a people, like the

      English, so little accustomed to observe a regular order in the succession

      of their monarchs. All delays might be dangerous, and the present occasion

      must hastily be embraced, while the Danes, without concert, without a

      leader, astonished at the present incident, and anxious only for their

      personal safety, durst not oppose the united voice of the nation.

     

      But this concurrence of circumstances in favor of Edward might have failed

      of its effect, had his succession been opposed by Godwin, whose power,

      alliances, and abilities gave him a great influence at all times,

      especially amidst those sudden opportunities which always attend a

      revolution of government, and which, either seized or neglected, commonly

      prove decisive. There were opposite reasons, which divided men’s hopes and

      fears with regard to Godwin’s conduct. On the one hand, the credit of that

      nobleman lay chiefly in Wessex, which was almost entirely inhabited by

      English; it was therefore presumed that he would second the wishes of that

      people in restoring the Saxon line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom

      he, as well as they, had reason to dread, as they had already felt, the

      most grievous oppressions. On the other hand, there subsisted a declared

      animosity between Edward and Godwin, on account of Alfred’s murder; of

      which the latter had publicly been accused by the prince, and which he

      might believe so deep an offence, as could never, on account of any

      subsequent merits, be sincerely pardoned. But their common friends here

      interposed; and representing the necessity of their good correspondence,

      obliged them to lay aside all jealousy and rancor, and concur in restoring

      liberty to their native country. Godwin only stipulated that Edward, as a

      pledge of his sincere reconciliation, should promise to marry his daughter

      Editha; and having fortified himself by this alliance, he summoned a

      general council at Gillingham, and prepared every measure for securing the

      succession to Edward. The English were unanimous and zealous in their

      resolutions; the Danes were divided and dispirited: any small opposition,

      which appeared in this assembly, was browbeaten and suppressed; and Edward

      was crowned king, with every Demonstration of duty and affection.

     

      The triumph of the English upon this signal and decisive advantage, was at

      first attended with some insult and violence against the Danes, but the

      king, by the mildness of his character, soon reconciled the latter to his

      administration, and the distinction between the two nations gradually

      disappeared. The Danes were interspersed with the English in most of the

      provinces; they spoke nearly the same language; they differed little in

      their manners and laws; domestic dissensions in Denmark prevented, for

      some years, any powerful invasion from thence which might awaken past

      animosities; and as the Norman conquest, which ensued soon after, reduced

      both nations to equal subjection, there is no further mention in history

      of any difference between them. The joy, however, of their present

      deliverance made such impression on the minds of the English, that they

      instituted an annual festival for celebrating that great event; and it was

      observed in some counties, even to the time of Spelman.[*]

     

      The popularity which Edward enjoyed on his accession was not destroyed by

      the first act of his administration, his resuming all the grants of his

      immediate predecessors; an attempt which is commonly attended with the

      most dangerous consequences. The poverty of the crown convinced the nation

      that this act of violence was become absolutely necessary; and as the loss

      fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large grants from the late

      kings, their countrymen, on account of their services in subduing the

      kingdom, the English were rather pleased to see them reduced to their

      primitive poverty. The king’s severity also towards his mother, the queen

      dowager, though exposed to some more censure, met not with very, general

      disapprobation. He had hitherto lived on indifferent terms with that

      princess; he accused her of neglecting him and his brother during their

      adverse fortune;[**] he remarked that, as the superior qualities of

      Canute, and his better treatment of her, had made her entirely indifferent

      to the memory of Etheldred, she also gave the preference to her children

      of the second bed, and always regarded Hardicanute as her favorite.

     

      The same reasons had probably made her unpopular in England; and though

      her benefactions to the monks obtained her the favor of that order, the

      nation was not, in general, displeased to see her stripped by Edward of

      immense treasures which she had amassed. He confined her, during the

      remainder of her life, in a monastery at Winchester; but carried his rigor

      against her no farther. The stories of his accusing her of a participation

      in her son Alfred’s murder, and of a criminal correspondence with the

      bishop of Winchester, and also of her justifying herself by treading

      barefoot, without receiving any hurt, over nine burning ploughshares, were

      the inventions of the monkish historians, and were propagated and believed

      from the silly wonder of posterity.[*]

     

      The English flattered themselves that, by the accession of Edward, they

      were delivered forever from the dominion of foreigners; but they soon

      found that this evil was not yet entirely removed. The king had been

      educated in Normandy, and had contracted many intimacies with the natives

      of that country, as well as an affection for their manners.[**] The court

      of England was soon filled with Normans, who, being distinguished both by

      the favor of Edward, and by a degree of cultivation superior to that which

      was attained by the English in those ages, soon rendered their language,

      customs, and laws fashionable in the kingdom. The study of the French

      tongue became general among the people. The courtiers affected to imitate

      that nation in their dress, equipage, and entertainments; even the lawyers

      employed a foreign language in their deeds and papers;[***] but above all,

      the church felt the influence and dominion of those strangers: Ulf and

      William, two Normans, who had formerly been the king’s chaplains, were

      created bishops of Dorchester and London. Robert, a Norman also, was

      promoted to the see of Canterbury,[****] and always enjoyed the highest

      favor of his master, of which his abilities rendered him not unworthy. And

      though the king’s prudence, or his want of authority, made him confer

      almost all the civil and military employments on the natives, the

      ecclesiastical preferments fell often to the share of the Normans; and as

      the latter possessed Edward’s confidence, they had secretly a great

      influence on public affairs, and excited the jealousy of the English,

      particularly of Earl Godwin.[*****]

     

      This powerful nobleman, besides being duke or earl of Wessex, had the

      counties of Kent and Sussex annexed to his government. His eldest son,

      Sweyn, possessed the same authority in the counties of Oxford, Berks,

      Glocester, and Hereford; and Harold, his second son, was duke of East

      Anglia, and at the same time governor of Essex. The great authority of

      this family was supported by immense possessions and powerful alliances;

      and the abilities, as well as ambition of Godwin himself, contributed to

      render it still more dangerous. A prince of greater capacity and vigor

      than Edward would have found it difficult to support the dignity of the

      crown under such circumstances; and as the haughty temper of Godwin made

      him often forget the respect due to his prince Edward’s animosity against

      him was grounded on personal as well as political considerations, on

      recent as well as more ancient injuries. The king, in pursuance of his

      engagements, had indeed married Editha, the daughter of Godwin;[*] but

      this alliance became a fresh source of enmity between them. Edward’s

      hatred of the father was transferred to that princess-; and Editha, though

      possessed of many amiable accomplishments, could never acquire the

      confidence and affection of her husband. It is even pretended, that,

      during the whole course of her life, he abstained from all commerce of

      love with her; and such was the absurd admiration paid to an inviolable

      chastity during those ages, that his conduct in this particular is highly

      celebrated by the monkish historians, and greatly contributed to his

      acquiring the title of saint and confessor[**]

     

      1048.

     

      The most popular pretence on which Godwin could ground his disaffection to

      the king and his administration, was to complain of the influence of the

      Normans in the government; and a declared opposition had thence arisen

      between him and these favorites. It was not long before this animosity

      broke out into action. Eustace, count of Boulogne, having paid a visit to

      the king, passed by Dover in his return: one of his train, being refused

      entrance to a lodging, which had been assigned him, attempted to make his

      way by force, and in the contest he wounded the master of the house. The

      inhabitants revenged this insult by the death of the stranger; the count

      and his train took arms, and murdered the wounded townsman; a tumult

      ensued; near twenty persons were killed on each side; and Eustace, being

      overpowered by numbers, was obliged to save his life by flight from the

      fury of the populace.

     

      He hurried immediately to court, and complained of tne usage he had met

      with: the king entered zealously into the quarrel, and was highly

      displeased that a stranger of such distinction, whom he had invited over

      to his court, should, without any just cause, as he believed, have felt so

      sensibly the insolence and animosity of his people. He gave orders to

      Godwin, in whose government Dover lay, to repair immediately to the place,

      and to punish the inhabitants for tne crime; but Godwin, who desired

      rather to encourage than express the popular discontents against

      foreigners, refused obedience, and endeavored to throw the whole blame of

      the riot on the count of Boulogne and his retinue.[*] Edward, touched in

      so sensible a point, saw the necessity of exerting the royal authority;

      and he threatened Godwin, if he persisted in his disobedience, to make him

      feel the utmost effects of his resentment.

     

      The earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable, and pleased to embark in

      a cause where it was likely he should be supported by his countrymen, made

      preparations for his own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward. Under

      pretence of repressing some disorders on the Welsh frontier, he secretly

      assembled a great army, and was approaching the king, who resided, without

      any military force, and without suspicion, at Glocester.[**]

     

      Edward applied for protection to Siward, duke of Northumberland, and

      Leofric, duke of Mercia, two powerful noblemen, whose jealousy of Godwin’s

      greatness, as well as their duty to the crown, engaged them to defend the

      king in this extremity. They hastened to him with such of their followers

      as they could assemble on a sudden; and finding the danger much greater

      than they had at first apprehended, they issued orders for mustering all

      the forces within their respective governments, and for marching them

      without delay to the defence of the king’s person and authority. Edward,

      meanwhile, endeavored to gain time by negotiation; while Godwin, who

      thought the king entirely in his power, and who was willing to save

      appearances, fell into the snare; and not sensible that he ought to have

      no further reserve after he had proceeded so far, he lost the favorable

      opportunity of rendering himself master of the government.

     

      The English, though they had no high idea of Edward’s vigor and capacity,

      bore him great affection on account of his humanity, justice, and piety,

      as well as the long race of their native kings, from whom he was

      descended; and they hastened from all quarters to defend him from the

      present danger. Hia army was now so considerable, that he ventured to take

      the field; and marching to London, he summoned a great council to judge of

      the rebellion of Godwin and his sons. These noblemen pretended at first

      that they were willing to stand their trial; but having in vain endeavored

      to make their adherents persist in rebellion, they offered to come to

      London, provided they might receive hostages for their safety: this

      proposal being rejected, they were obliged to disband the remains of their

      forces, and have recourse to flight. Baldwin, earl of Flanders, gave

      protection to Godwin and his three sons, Gurth, Sweyn, and Tosti, the

      latter of whom had married the daughter of that prince; Harold and

      Leofwin, two others of his sons, took shelter in Ireland. The estates of

      the father and sons were confiscated; their governments were given to

      others; Queen Editha was confined in a monastery at Warewel; and the

      greatness of this family, once so formidable, seemed now to be totally

      supplanted and overthrown But Godwin had fixed his authority on too firm a

      basis, and he was too strongly supported by alliances both foreign and

      domestic, not to occasion further disturbances, and make new efforts for

      his reÃ«stablishment.

     

      1052.

     

      The earl of Flanders permitted him to purchase and hire ships within his

      harbors; and Godwin, having manned them with his followers, and with

      freebooters of all nations, put to sea, and attempted to make a descent at

      Sandwich. The king, informed of his preparations, had equipped a

      considerable fleet, much superior to that of the enemy; and the earl

      hastily, before their appearance, made his retreat into the Flemish

      harbors.[*] The English court, allured by the present security, and

      destitute of all vigorous counsels, allowed the seamen to disband, and the

      fleet to go to decay;[**] while Godwin, expecting this event, kept his men

      in readiness for action. He put to sea immediately, and sailed to the Isle

      of Wight, where he was joined by Harold with a squadron, which that

      nobleman had collected in Ireland. He was now master of the sea; and

      entering every harbor in the southern coast, he seized all the ships,[***]

      and summoned his followers in those counties, which had so long been

      subject to his government, to assist him in procuring justice to himself

      his family, and his country, against the tyranny of foreigners.

     

      ReÃ«nforced by great numbers from all quarters, he entered the Thames; and

      appearing before London, threw every thing into confusion. The king alone

      seemed resolute to defend himself to the last extremity; but the

      interposition of the English nobility, many of whom favored Godwin’s

      pretensions, made Edward hearken to terms of accommodation; and the

      feigned humility of the earl, who disclaimed all intentions of offering

      violence to his sovereign, and desired only to justify himself by a fair

      and open trial, paved the way for his more easy admission. It was

      stipulated that he should give hostages for his good behavior, and that

      the primate and all the foreigners should be banished: by this treaty the

      present danger of a civil war was obviated, but the authority of the crown

      was considerably impaired, or rather entirely annihilated. Edward,

      sensible that he had not power sufficient to secure Godwin’s hostages in

      England, sent them over to his kinsman, the young duke of Normandy.

     

      Godwin’s death, which happened soon after, while he was sitting at table

      with the king, prevented him from further establishing the authority which

      he had acquired, and from reducing Edward to still greater subjection.[*]

      5 He was

      succeeded in the government of Wessex, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, and in the

      office of steward of the household, a place of great power, by his son

      Harold, who was actuated by an ambition equal to that of his father, and

      was superior to him in address, in insinuation, and in virtue. By a modest

      and gentle demeanor, he acquired the good will of Edward; at least,

      softened that hatred which the prince had so long borne his family;[**]

      and gaining every day new partisans by his bounty and affability, he

      proceeded, in a more silent, and therefore a more dangerous manner, to the

      increase of his authority. The king, who had not sufficient vigor directly

      to oppose his progress, knew of no other expedient than that hazardous one

      of raising him a rival in the family of Leofric, duke of Mercia, whose son

      Algar was invested with the government of East Anglia, which, before the

      banishment of Harold, had belonged to the latter nobleman. But this

      policy, of balancing opposite parties, required a more steady hand to

      manage it than that of Edward, and naturally produced faction and even

      civil broils, among nobles of such mighty and independent authority.

     

      Algar was soon after expelled his government by the intrigues and power of

      Harold; but being protected by Griffith, prince of Wales, who had married

      his daughter, as well as by the power of his father Leofric, he obliged

      Harold to submit to an accommodation, and was reinstated in the government

      of East Anglia. This peace was not of long duration: Harold, taking

      advantage of Leofric’s death, which happened soon after, expelled Algar

      anew, and banished him the kingdom: and though that nobleman made a fresh

      irruption into East Anglia with an army of Norwegians, and overran the

      country, his death soon freed Harold from the pretensions of so dangerous

      a rival. Edward, the eldest son of Algar, was indeed advanced to the

      government of Mercia; but the balance which the king desired to establish

      between those potent families, was wholly lost, and the influence of

      Harold greatly preponderated.

     

      1055.

     

      The death of Siward, duke of Northumberland, made the way still more open

      to the ambition of that nobleman. Siward, besides his other merits, had

      acquired honor to England by his successful conduct in the only foreign

      enterprise undertaken during the reign of Edward. Duncan, king of

      Scotland, was a prince of a gentle disposition, but possessed not the

      genius requisite for governing a country so turbulent, and so much

      infested by the intrigues and animosities of the great. Macbeth, a

      powerful nobleman, and nearly allied to the crown, not content with

      curbing the king’s authority, carried still farther his pestilent

      ambition: he put his sovereign to death; chased Malcolm Kenmore, his son

      and heir, into England, and usurped the crown. Siward, whose daughter was

      married to Duncan, embraced, by Edward’s orders, the protection of this

      distressed family: he marched an army into Scotland; and having defeated

      and killed Macbeth in battle, he restored Malcolm to the throne of his

      ancestors.[*]

     

      This service, added to his former connections with the royal family of

      Scotland, brought a great accession to the authority of Siward in the

      north; but as he had lost his eldest son, Osberne, in the action with

      Macbeth, it proved in the issue fatal to his family. His second son,

      Walthoef, appeared, on his father’s death, too young to be intrusted with

      the government of Northumberland; and Harold’s influence obtained that

      dukedom for his own brother Tosti.

     

      There are two circumstances related of Siward, which discover his high

      sense of honor, and his martial disposition. When intelligence was brought

      him of his son Osberne’s death, he was inconsolable; till he heard that

      the wound was received in the breast, and that he had behaved with great

      gallantry in the action. When he found his own death approaching, he

      ordered his servants to clothe him in a complete suit of armor; and

      sitting erect on the couch, with a spear in his hand, declared, that in

      that posture, the only one worthy of a warrior, he would patiently await

      the fatal moment.

     

      The king, now worn out with cares and infirmities, felt himself far

      advanced in the decline of life; and having no issue himself, began to

      think of appointing a successor to the kingdom. He sent a deputation to

      Hungary, to invite over his nephew Edward, son of his elder brother, and

      the only remaining heir of the Saxon line. That prince, whose succession

      to the crown would have been easy and undisputed, came to England with his

      children, Edgar, surnamed Atheling, Margaret, and Christina; but his

      death, which happened a few days after his arrival, threw the king into

      new difficulties. He saw that the great power and ambition of Harold had

      tempted him to think of obtaining possession of the throne on the first

      vacancy, and that Edgar, on account of his youth and inexperience, was

      very unfit to oppose the pretensions of so popular and enterprising a

      rival. The animosity which he had long borne to Earl Godwin, made him

      averse to the succession of his son; and he could not, without extreme

      reluctance, think of an increase of grandeur to a family which had risen

      on the ruins of royal authority, and which, by the murder of Alfred, his

      brother, had contributed so much to the weakening of the Saxon line. In

      this uncertainty, he secretly cast his eye towards his kinsman, William

      duke of Normandy, as the only person whose power, and reputation, and

      capacity, could support any destination which he might make in his favor,

      to the exclusion of Harold and his family.[*]

     

      This famous prince was natural son of Robert, duke of Normandy, by

      Harlotta, daughter of a tanner in Falaise,[**] and was very early

      established in that grandeur, from which his birth seemed to have set him

      at so great a distance.

     

      While he was but nine years of age, his father had resolved to undertake a

      pilgrimage to Jerusalem; a fashionable act of devotion, which had taken

      place of the pilgrimages to Rome, and which, as it was attended with more

      difficulty and danger, and carried those religious adventurers to the

      first sources of Christianity, appeared to them more meritorious. Before

      his departure, he assembled the states of the duchy; and in forming them

      of his design, he engaged them to swear allegiance to his natural son,

      William, whom, as he had no legitimate issue, he intended, in case he

      should die in the pilgrimage, to leave successor to his dominions.[*] As

      he was a prudent prince, he could not but foresee the great

      inconveniencies which must attend this journey, and this settlement of his

      succession; arising from the perpetual turbulency of the great, the claims

      of other branches of the ducal family and the power of the French monarch;

      but all these considerations were surmounted by the prevailing zeal for

      pilgrimages;[**] and probably the more important they were, the more would

      Robert exult in sacrificing them to what he imagined to be his religious

      duty.

     

      This prince, as he had apprehended, died in his pilgrimage; and the

      minority of his son was attended with all those disorders which were

      almost unavoidable in that situation. The licentious nobles, freed from

      the awe of sovereign authority, broke out into personal animosities

      against each other, and made the whole country a scene of war and

      devastation.[***] Roger, count of Toni, and Alain, count of Brittany,

      advanced claims to the dominion of the state; and Henry the First king of

      France, thought the opportunity favorable for reducing the power of a

      vassal, who had originally acquired his settlement in so violent and

      invidious a manner, and who had long appeared formidable to his

      sovereign.[****] The regency established by Robert encountered great

      difficulties in supporting the government under his complication of

      dangers; and the young prince, when he came to maturity, found himself

      reduced to a very low condition. But the great qualities which he soon

      displayed in the field and in the cabinet, gave encouragement to his

      friends, and struck a terror into his enemies. He opposed himself on all

      sides against his rebellious subjects, and against foreign invaders; and

      by his valor and conduct prevailed in every action.

     

      He obliged the French king to grant him peace on reasonable terms; he

      expelled all pretenders to the sovereignty; and he reduced his turbulent

      barons to pay submission to his authority, and to suspend their mutual

      animosities. The natural severity of his temper appeared in a rigorous

      administration of justice; and having found the happy effects of this plan

      of government, without which the laws in those ages became totally

      impotent, he regarded it as a fixed maxim, that an inflexible conduct was

      the first duty of a sovereign.

     

      The tranquillity which he had established in his dominions, had given

      William leisure to pay a visit to the king of England, during the time of

      Godwin’s banishment; and he was received in a manner suitable to the great

      reputation which he had acquired, to the relation by which he was

      connected with Edward, and to the obligations which that prince owed to

      his family.[*] On the return of Godwin, and the expulsion of the Norman

      favorites, Robert, archbishop of Canterbury, had, before his departure,

      persuaded Edward to think of adopting William as his successor; a counsel

      which was favored by the king’s aversion to Godwin, his prepossessions for

      the Normans, and his esteem of the duke. That prelate, therefore, received

      a commission to inform William of the king’s intentions in his favor; and

      he was the first person that opened the mind of the prince to entertain

      those ambitious hopes.[**] But Edward, irresolute and feeble in his

      purpose, finding that the English would more easily acquiesce in the

      restoration of the Saxon line, and in the mean time invited his brother’s

      descendants from Hungary, with a view of having them recognized heirs to

      the crown.

     

      The death of his nephew, and the inexperience and unpromising qualities of

      young Edgar, made him resume his former intentions in favor of the duke of

      Normandy; though his aversion to hazardous enterprises engaged him to

      postpone the execution, and even to keep his purpose secret from all his

      ministers.

     

      Harold, meanwhile, proceeded after a more open manner, in increasing his

      popularity, in establishing his power, and in preparing the way for his

      advancement on the first vacancy; an event which, from the age and

      infirmities of the king, appeared not very distant. But there was still an

      obstacle, which it was requisite for him previously to overcome. Earl

      Godwin, when restored to his power and fortune, had given hostages for his

      good behavior; and among the rest one son and one grandson, whom Edward,

      for greater security, as has been related, had consigned to the custody of

      the duke of Normandy. Harold, though not aware of the duke’s being his

      competitor, was uneasy that such near relations should be detained

      prisoners in a foreign country; and he was afraid lest William should, in

      favor of Edgar, retain these pledges as a check on the ambition of any

      other pretender. He represented, therefore, to the king his unfeigned

      submission to royal authority, his steady duty to his prince, and the

      little necessity there was, after such a uniform trial of his obedience,

      to detain any longer those hostages, who had been required on the first

      composing of civil discords. By these topics, enforced by his great power,

      he extorted the king’s consent to release them; and in order to effect his

      purpose, he immediately proceeded, with a numerous retinue, on his journey

      to Normandy. A tempest drove him on the territory of Guy, count of

      Ponthieu, who, being informed of his quality, immediately detained him

      prisoner, and demanded an exorbitant sum for his ransom. Harold found

      means to convey intelligence of his situation to the duke of Normandy; and

      represented that, while he was proceeding to his court, in execution of a

      commission from the king of England, he had met with this harsh treatment

      from the mercenary disposition of the count of Ponthieu.

     

      William was immediately sensible of the importance of the incident. He

      foresaw that, if he could once gain Harold, either by favors or menaces,

      his way to the throne of England would be open, and Edward would meet with

      no further obstacle in executing the favorable intentions which he had

      entertained in his behalf. He sent, therefore, a messenger to Guy, in

      order to demand the liberty of his prisoner; and that nobleman, not daring

      to refuse so great a prince, put Harold into the hands of the Norman, who

      conducted him to Rouen. William received him with every demonstration of

      respect and friendship; and after showing himself disposed to comply with

      his desire in delivering up the hostages, he look an opportunity of

      disclosing to him the great secret of his pretensions to the crown of

      England, and of the will which Edward intended to make in his favor. He

      desired the assistance of Harold in perfecting that design; he made

      professions of the utmost gratitude in return for so great an obligation;

      he promised that the present grandeur of Harold’s family, which supported

      itself with difficulty under the jealousy and hatred of Edward, should

      receive new increase from a successor, who would be so greatly beholden to

      him for his advancement Harold was surprised at this declaration of the

      duke; but being sensible that he should never recover his own liberty,

      much less that of his brother and nephew, if he refused the demand, he

      feigned a compliance with William, renounced all hopes of the crown for

      himself, and professed his sincere intention of supporting the will of

      Edward, and seconding the ptetensions of the duke of Normandy. William, to

      bind him faster to his interests, besides offering him one of his

      daughters in marriage, required him to take an oath that, he would fulfil

      his promises; and in order to render the oath more obligatory, he employed

      an artifice well suited to the ignorance and superstition of the age. He

      secretly conveyed under the altar, on which Harold agreed to swear, the

      relics of some of the most revered martyrs; and when Harold had taken the

      oath, he showed him the relics, and admonished him to observe religiously

      an engagement which had been ratified by so tremendous a sanction.[*] The

      English nobleman was astonished; but dissembling his concern, he renewed

      the same professions, and was dismissed with all the marks of mutual

      confidence by the duke of Normandy.

     

      When Harold found himself at liberty, his ambition suggested casuistry

      sufficient to justify to him the violation of an oath, which had been

      extorted from him by fear, and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with

      the subjection of his native country to a foreign power. He continued

      still to practise every art of popularity; to increase the number of his

      partisans; to reconcile the minds of the English to the idea of his

      succession; to revive their hatred of the Normans; and, by an ostentation

      of his power and influence, to deter the timorous Edward from executing

      his intended destination in favor of William. Fortune, about this time,

      threw two incidents in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire general

      favor, and to increase the character, which he had already attained, of

      virtue and abilities.

     

      The Welsh, though a less formidable enemy than the Danes, had long been

      accustomed to infest the western borders; and after committing spoil on

      the low countries, they usually made a hasty retreat into their mountains,

      where they were sheltered from the pursuit of their enemies, and were

      ready to seize the first favorable opportunity of renewing their

      depredations. Griffith, the reigning prince, had greatly distinguished

      himself in those incursions; and his name had become so terrible to the

      English, that Harold found he could do nothing more acceptable to the

      public, and more honorable for himself, than the suppressing of so

      dangerous an enemy. He formed the plan of an expedition against Wales; and

      having prepared some light-armed foot to pursue the natives in their

      fastnesses, some cavalry to scour the open country, and a squadron of

      ships to attack the sea-coast, he employed at once all these forces

      against the Welsh, prosecuted his advantages with vigor, made no

      intermission in his assaults, and at last reduced the enemy to such

      distress, that, in order to prevent their total destruction, they made a

      sacrifice of their prince, whose head they cut off, and sent to Harold;

      and they were content to receive as their sovereigns two Welsh noblemen

      appointed by Edward to rule over them. The other incident was no less

      honorable to Harold.

     

      Tosti, brother of this nobleman, who had been created duke of

      Northumberland, being of a violent, tyrannical temper, had acted with such

      cruelty and injustice, that the inhabitants rose in rebellion, and chased

      him from his government. Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who possessed

      great power in those parts, and who were grandsons of the great duke,

      Leofric, concurred in the insurrection; and the former, being elected

      duke, advanced with an army to oppose Harold, who was commissioned by the

      king to reduce and chastise the Northumbrians. Before the armies came to

      action, Morcar, well acquainted with the generous disposition of the

      English commander, endeavored to justify his own conduct. He represented

      to Harold, that Tosti had behaved in a manner unworthy of the station to

      which he was advanced, and no one, not even a brother, could support such

      tyranny, without participating, in some degree, of the infamy attending

      it; that the Northumbrians, accustomed to a legal administration, and

      regarding it as their birthright, were willing to submit to the king, but

      required a governor who would pay regard to their rights and privileges;

      that they had been taught by their ancestors, that death was preferable to

      servitude, and had taken the field determined to perish, rather than

      suffer a renewal of those indignities to which they had so long been

      exposed; and they trusted that Harold, on reflection, would not defend in

      another that violent conduct, from which he himself in his own government,

      had always kept at so great a distance. Thus vigorous remonstrance was

      accompanied with such a detail of facts, so well supported, that Harold

      found it prudent to abandon his brother’s cause; and returning to Edward,

      he persuaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to confirm Morcar in the

      government. He even married the sister of that nobleman;[*] and by his

      interest procured Edwin, the younger brother, to be elected into the

      government of Mercia. Tosti in a rage departed the kingdom, and took

      shelter in Flanders with Earl Baldwin, his father-in-law.

     

      By this marriage, Harold broke all measures with the duke of Normandy, and

      William clearly perceived that he could no longer rely on the oaths and

      promises which he had extorted from him. But the English nobleman was now

      in such a situation, that he deemed it no longer necessary to dissemble.

      He had, in his conduct towards the Northumbrians, given such a specimen of

      his moderation as had gained him the affections of his countrymen. He saw

      that almost all England was engaged in his interests; while he himself

      possessed the government of Wessex, Morcar that of Northumberland, and

      Edwin that of Mercia. He now openly aspired to the succession; and

      insisted, that since it was necessary, by the confession of all, to set

      aside the royal family, on account of the imbecility of Edgar, the sole

      surviving heir, there was no one so capable of filling the throne, as a

      nobleman of great power of mature age, of long experience, of approved

      courage and abilities, who, being a native of the kingdom, would

      effectually secure it against the dominion and tyranny of foreigners.

      Edward, broken with age and infirmities, saw the difficulties too great

      for him to encounter; and though his inveterate prepossessions kept him

      from seconding the pretensions of Harold, he took but feeble and

      irresolute steps for securing the succession to the duke of Normandy.[**]

      6 While

      he continued in this uncertainty, he was surprised by sickness, which

      brought him to his grave on the fifth of January, 1066, in the sixty-fifth

      year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.

     

      This prince, to whom the monks gave the title of Saint and Confessor, was

      the last of the Saxon line that ruled in England. Though his reign was

      peaceable and fortunate, he owed his prosperity less to his own abilities

      than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, employed in other

      enterprises, at tempted not those incursions which had been so troublesome

      to all his predecessors, and fatal to some of them. The facility of his

      disposition made him acquiesce under the government of Godwin and his son

      Harold; and the abilities, as well as the power of these noblemen, enabled

      them, while they were intrusted with authority, to preserve domestic peace

      and tranquillity. The most commendable circumstance of Edward’s government

      was his attention to the administration of justice, and his compiling, for

      that purpose, a body of laws which he collected from the laws of

      Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, though now lost, (for the

      laws that pass under Edward’s name were composed afterwards,[*]) was long

      the object of affection to the English nation.

     

      Edward the Confessor was the first that touched for the king’s evil: the

      opinion of his sanctity procured belief to this cure among the people: his

      successors regarded it as a part of their state and grandeur to uphold the

      same opinion. It has been continued down to our time; and the practice was

      first dropped by the present royal family, who observed that it could no

      longer give amazement even to the populace, and was attended with ridicule

      in the eyes of all men of understanding.

     

 
 

      1066.

     

      Harold had so well prepared matters before the death of Edward, that he

      immediately stepped into the vacant throne; and his accession was attended

      with as little opposition and disturbance, as if he had succeeded by the

      most undoubted hereditary title. The citizens of London were his zealous

      partisans; the bishops and clergy had adopted his cause; and all the

      powerful nobility, connected with him by alliance or friendship, willingly

      seconded his pretensions. The title of Edgar Atheling was scarcely

      mentioned, much less the claim of the duke of Normandy; and Harold,

      assembling his partisans, received the crown from their hands, without

      waiting for the free deliberation of the states, or regularly submitting

      the question to their determination.[*] If any were averse to this

      measure, they were obliged to conceal their sentiments; and the new

      prince, taking a general silence for consent, and founding his title on

      the supposed suffrages of the people, which appeared unanimous, was, on

      the day immediately succeeding Edward’s death, crowned and anointed king,

      by Aldred, archbishop of York. The whole nation seemed joyfully to

      acquiesce in his elevation.

     

      The first symptoms of danger which the king discovered, came from abroad,

      and from his own brother, Tosti, who had submitted to a voluntary

      banishment in Flanders. Enraged at the successful ambition of Harold, to

      which he himself had fallen a victim, he filled the court of Baldwin with

      complaints of the injustice which he had suffered; he engaged the interest

      of that family against his brother; he endeavored to form intrigues with

      some of the discontented nobles in England he sent his emissaries to

      Norway, in order to rouse to arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and to

      excite their hopes of reaping advantage from the unsettled state of

      affairs on the usurpation of the new king; and, that he might render the

      combination more formidable, he made a journey to Normandy, in expectation

      that the duke, who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin,

      would, in revenge of his own wrongs, as well as those of Tosti, second, by

      his counsels and forces, the projected invasion of England.[**]

     

      The duke of Normandy, when he first received intelligence of Harold’s

      intrigues and accessions, had been moved to the highest pitch of

      indignation; but that he might give the better color to his pretensions,

      he sent an embassy to England, upbraiding that prince with his breach of

      faith, and summoning him to resign, immediately, possession of the

      kingdom. Harold replied to the Norman ambassadors, that the oath, with

      which he was reproached, had been extorted by the well-grounded fear of

      violence, and could never, for that reason, be regarded as obligatory;

      that he had had no commission, either from the late king or the states of

      England, who alone could dispose of the crown, to make any tender of the

      succession to the duke of Normandy; and if he, a private person, had

      assumed so much authority, and had even voluntarily sworn to support the

      duke’s pretensions, the oath was unlawful, and It was his duty to seize

      the first opportunity of breaking it: that he had obtained the crown by

      the unanimous suffrages of the people, and should prove himself totally

      unworthy of their favor, did he not strenuously maintain those national

      liberties, with whose protection they had intrusted him; and that the

      duke, if he made any attempt by force of arms, should experience the power

      of a united nation, conducted by a prince who, sensible of the obligations

      imposed on him by his royal dignity, was determined that the same moment

      should put a period to his life and to his government.[*]

     

      This answer was no other than William expected; and he had previously

      fixed his resolution of making an attempt upon England. Consulting only

      his courage, his resentment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the

      difficulties inseparable from an attack on a great kingdom by such

      inferior force, and he saw only the circumstances which would facilitate

      his enterprise. He considered that England, ever since the accession of

      Canute, had enjoyed profound tranquillity, during a period of near fifty

      years; and it would require time for its soldiers, enervated by long

      peace, to learn discipline, and its generals experience. He knew that it

      was entirely unprovided with fortified towns, by which it could prolong

      the war; but must venture its whole fortune in one decisive action,

      against a veteran enemy, who, being once master of the field, would be in

      a condition to overrun the kingdom. He saw that Harold, though he had

      given proofs of vigor and bravery, had newly mounted a throne which he had

      acquired by faction, from which he had excluded a very ancient royal

      family, and which was likely to totter under him by its own instability,

      much more if shaken by any violent external impulse. And he hoped that the

      very circumstance of his crossing the sea, quitting his own country, and

      leaving himself no hopes of retreat, as it would astonish the enemy by the

      boldness of the enterprise, would inspirit his soldiers by despair, and

      rouse them to sustain the reputation of the Norman arms.

     

      The Normans, as they had long been distinguished by valor among all the

      European nations, had, at this time, attained to the highest pitch of

      military glory. Besides acquiring by arms such a noble territory in

      France, besides defending it against continual attempts of the French

      monarch and all its neighbors, besides exerting many acts of vigor under

      their present sovereign, they had, about this very time, revived their

      ancient fame, by the most hazardous exploits, and the moat wonderful

      successes, in the other extremity of Europe. A few Norman adventurers in

      Italy had acquired such an ascendant, not only over the Italians and

      Greeks, but the Germans and Saracens, that they expelled those foreigners,

      procured to themselves ample establishments, and laid the foundation of

      the opulent kingdom of Naples and Sicily.[*] These enterprises of men, who

      were all of them vassals in Normandy many of them banished for faction and

      rebellion, excited the ambition of the haughty William, who disdained,

      after such examples of fortune and valor, to be deterred from making an

      Attack on a neighboring country, where he could be supported by the whole

      force of his principality.

     

      The situation also of Europe inspired William with hopes that, besides his

      brave Normans, he might employ against England the flower of the military

      force which was dispersed in all the neighboring states. France, Germany,

      and the Low Countries, by the progress of the feudal institutions, were

      divided and subdivided into many principalities and baronies; and the

      possessors, enjoying the civil jurisdiction within them selves, as well as

      the right of arms, acted, in many respects, as independent sovereigns, and

      maintained their propertied and privileges, less by the authority of laws,

      than by their own force and valor. A military spirit had universally

      diffused itself throughout Europe; and the several leaders, whose minds

      were elevated by their princely situation, greedily embraced the most

      hazardous enterprises; and being accustomed to nothing, from their

      infancy, but recitals of the success attending wars and battles, they were

      prompted by a natural ambition to imitate those adventures which they

      heard so much celebrated, and which were so much exaggerated by the

      credulity of the age. United, however loosely, by their duty to one

      superior lord, and by their connections with the great body of the

      community to which they belonged, they desired to spread their fame each

      beyond his own district and in all assemblies, whether instituted for

      civil deliberations for military expeditions, or merely for show and

      entertainment, to outshine each other by the reputation of strength and

      prowess. Hence their genius for chivalry; hence their impatience of peace

      and tranquillity; and hence their readiness to embark in any dangerous

      enterprise, how little soever interested in its failure or success.

     

      William, by his power, his courage, and his abilities, had long maintained

      a preeminence among those haughty chieftains; and every one who desired to

      signalize himself by his address in military exercises, or his valor in

      action, had been ambitious of acquiring a reputation in the court and in

      the armies of Normandy. Entertained with that hospitality and courtesy

      which distinguished the age, they had formed attachments with the prince,

      and greedily attended to the prospects of the signal glory and elevation

      which he promised them in return for their concurrence in an expedition

      against England. The more grandeur there appeared in the attempt, the more

      it suited their romantic spirit; the fame of the intended invasion was

      already diffused everywhere; multitudes crowded to tender to the duke

      their service, with that of their vassals and retainers;[*] and William

      found less difficulty in completing his levies, than in choosing the most

      veteran forces, and in rejecting the offers of those who were impatient to

      acquire fame under so renowned a leader.

     

      Besides these advantages, which William owed to his personal valor and

      good conduct, he was indebted to fortune for procuring him some

      assistance, and also for removing many obstacles which it was natural for

      him to expect, in an undertaking in which all his neighbors were so deeply

      interested. Conan, count of Brittany, was his mortal enemy: in order to

      throw a damp upon the duke’s enterprise, he chose this conjuncture for

      reviving his claim to Normandy itself; and he required that, in case of

      William’s success against England, the possession of that duchy should

      devolve to him.[**] But Conan died suddenly after making this demand; and

      Hoel, his successor, instead of adopting the malignity, or, more properly

      speaking, the prudence of his predecessor, zealously seconded the duke’s

      views, and sent his eldest son, Alain Fergant, to serve under him with a

      body of five thousand Bretons. The counts of Anjou and of Flanders

      encouraged their subjects to engage in the expedition; and even the court

      of France, though it might justly fear the aggrandizement of so dangerous

      a vassal, pursued not its interests on this occasion with sufficient vigor

      and resolution.

     

      Philip I., the reign ing monarch, was a minor; and William, having

      communicated his project to the council, having desired assistance, and

      offered to do homage, in case of his success, for the crown of England,

      was indeed openly ordered to lay aside all thoughts of the enterprise; but

      the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law, being at the head of the regency,

      favored underhand his levies, and secretly encouraged the adventurous

      nobility to enlist under the standard of the duke of Normandy.

     

      The emperor, Henry IV., besides openly giving all his vassals permission

      to embark in this expedition, which so much engaged the attention of

      Europe, promised his protection to the duchy of Normandy during the

      absence of the prince, and thereby enabled him to employ his whole force

      in the invasion of England.[*]

     

      But the most important ally that William gained by his negotiations, was

      the pope, who had a mighty influence over the ancient barons, no less

      devout in their religious principles than valorous in their military

      enterprises. The Roman pontiff, after an insensible progress during

      several ages of darkness and ignorance, began now to lift his head openly

      above all the princes of Europe; to assume the office of a mediator, or

      even an arbiter, in the quarrels of the greatest monarchs; to interpose in

      all secular affairs; and lo obtrude his dictates as sovereign laws on his

      obsequious disciples, It was a sufficient motive to Alexander II., the

      reigning pope, for embracing William’s quarrel, that he alone had made an

      appeal to his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the dispute between him

      and Harold; but there were other advantages which that pontiff foresaw

      must result from the conquest of England by the Norman arms. That kingdom,

      though at first converted by Romish missionaries, though it had afterwards

      advanced some farther steps towards subjection to Rome, maintained still a

      considerable independence in its ecclesiastical administration; and

      forming a world within itself, entirely separated from the rest of Europe,

      it had hitherto proved inaccessible to those exorbitant claims which

      supported the grandeur of the papacy. Alexander therefore hoped, that the

      French and Norman barons, if successful in their enterprise, might import

      into that country a more devoted reverence to the holy see, and bring the

      English churches to a nearer conformity with those of the continent. He

      declared immediately in favor of William’s claim; pronounced Harold a

      perjured usurper; denounced excommunication against him and his adherents;

      and the more to encourage the duke of Normandy in his enterprise, he sent

      him a consecrated banner, and a ring with one of St. Peter’s hairs in

      it.[*] Thus were all the ambition and violence of that invasion covered

      over safely with the broad mantle of religion.

     

      The greatest difficulty which William had to encounter in his

      preparations, arose from his own subjects in Normandy. The states of the

      duchy were assembled at Lislebonne; and supplies being demanded for the

      intended enterprise, which promised so much glory and advantage to their

      country, there appeared a reluctance in many members both to grant sums so

      much beyond the common measure of taxes in that age, and to set a

      precedent of performing their military service at a distance from their

      own country. The duke, finding it dangerous to solicit them in a body,

      conferred separately with the richest individuals in the province; and

      beginning with those on whose affections he most relied, he gradually

      engaged all of them to advance the sums demanded. The count of Longueville

      seconded him in this negotiation; as did the count of Mortaigne, Odo,

      bishop of Baieux, and especially William Fitz-Osborne, count of Breteuil,

      and constable of the duchy. Every person, when he himself was once

      engaged, endeavored to bring over others; and at last the states

      themselves, after stipulating that this concession should be no precedent,

      voted that they would assist their prince to the utmost in his intended

      enterprise.[**]

     

      William had now assembled a fleet of three thousand vessels, great and

      small,[***] and had selected an army of sixty thousand men from among

      those numerous supplies, which from every quarter solicited to be received

      into his service.

     

      The camp bore a splendid, yet a martial appearance, from the discipline of

      the men, the beauty and vigor of the horses, the lustre of the arms, and

      the accoutrements of both; but above all, from the high names of nobility

      who engaged under the banners of the duke of Normandy. The most celebrated

      were Eustace, count of Boulogne, Aimeri de Thouars, Hugh d’Estaples,

      William d’Evreux, Geoffrey de Rotrou, Roger de Beaumont, William de

      Warenne, Roger de Montgomery, Hugh de Grantmesnil, Charles Martel, and

      Geoffrey Giffard.[*] To these bold chieftains William held up the spoils

      of England as the prize of their valor; and pointing to the opposite

      shore, called to them that there was the field, on which they must

      erect trophies to their name, and fix their establishments.

     

      While he was making these mighty preparations, the duke, that he might

      increase the number of Harold’s enemies, excited the inveterate rancor of

      Tosti, and encouraged him, in concert with Harold Halfager, king of

      Norway, to infest the coasts of England. Tosti, having collected about

      sixty vessels in the ports of Flanders, put to sea; and after committing

      some depredations on the south and east coasts, he sailed to

      Northumberland, and was there joined by Halfager, who came over with a

      great armament of three hundred sail. The combined fleets entered the

      Humber, and disembarked the troops, who began to extend their depredations

      on all sides; when Morcar, earl of Northumberland, and Edwin, earl of

      Mercia, the king’s brother-in-law, having hastily collected some forces,

      ventured to give them battle. The action ended in the defeat and flight of

      these two noblemen.

     

      Harold, informed of this defeat, hastened with an army to the protection

      of his people; and expressed the utmost ardor to show himself worthy of

      the crown, which had been conferred upon him. This prince, though he was

      not sensible of the full extent of his danger, from the great combination

      against him, had employed every art of popularity to acquire the

      affections of the public; and he gave so many proofs of an equitable and

      prudent administration, that the English found no reason to repent the

      choice which they had made of a sovereign. They flocked from all quarters

      to join his standard; and as soon as he reached the enemy at Standford, he

      found himself in condition to give them battle. The action was bloody; but

      the victory was decisive on the side of Harold, and ended in the total

      rout of the Norwegians, together with the death of Tosti and Halfager.

      Even the Norwegian fleet fell into the hands of Harold, who had the

      generosity to give prince Olave, the son of Halfager, his liberty, and

      allow him to depart with twenty vessels. But he had scarcely time to

      rejoice for this victory, when he received itelligence that the duke of

      Normandy was landed with a great army in the south of England.

     

      The Norman fleet and army had been assembled, early in the summer, at the

      mouth of the small river Dive, and all the troops had been instantly

      embarked; but the winds proved long contrary, and detained them in that

      harbor. The authority, however, of the duke, the good discipline

      maintained among the seamen and soldiers, and the great care in supplying

      them with provisions, had prevented any disorder, when at last the wind

      became favorable, and enabled them to sail along the coast, till they

      reached St. Valori. There were, however, several vessels lost in this

      short passage; and as the wind again proved contrary, the army began to

      imagine that Heaven had declared against them, and that, notwithstanding

      the pope’s benediction, they were destined to certain destruction. These

      bold warriors, who despised real dangers, were very subject to the dread

      of imaginary ones; and many of them began to mutiny, some of them even to

      desert their colors, when the duke, in order to support their drooping

      hopes, ordered a procession to be made with the relics of St. Valori,[*]

      and prayers to be said for more favorable weather.

     

      The wind instantly changed; and as this incident happened on the eve of

      the feast of St. Michael, the tutelar saint of Normandy, the soldiers,

      fancying they saw the hand of Heaven in all these concurring

      circumstances, set out with the greatest alacrity: they met with no

      opposition on their passage. A great fleet which Harold had assembled, and

      which had cruised all summer off the Isle of Wight, had been dismissed on

      his receiving false intelligence that William, discouraged by contrary

      winds and other accidents, had laid aside his preparations. The Norman

      armament, proceeding in great order, arrived, without any material loss,

      at Pevensey, in Sussex; and the army quietly disembarked. The duke

      himself, as he leaped on shore, happened to stumble and fall; but had the

      presence of mind, it is said, to turn the omen to his advantage, by

      calling aloud that he had taken possession of the country. And a soldier,

      running to a neighboring cottage, plucked some thatch, which, as if giving

      him seizin of the kingdom, he presented to his general. The joy and

      alacrity of William and his whole army was so great, that they were nowise

      discouraged, evan when they heard of Harold’s great victory over the

      Norwegians. They seemed rather to wait with impatience the arrival of the

      enemy.

     

      The victory of Harold, though great and honorable, had proved in the main

      prejudicial to his interests, and may be regarded as the immediate cause

      of his ruin. He lost many of his bravest officers and soldiers in the

      action, and he disgusted the rest by refusing to distribute the Norwegian

      spoils among them; a conduct which was little agreeable to his usual

      generosity of temper, but which his desire of sparing the people, in the

      war that impended over him from the duke of Normandy, had probably

      occasioned. He hastened by quick marches to reach this new invader; but

      though he was reÃ¨nforced at London and other places with fresh troops, he

      found himself also weakened by the desertion of his old soldiers, who from

      fatigue and discontent secretly withdrew from their colors. His brother

      Gurth, a man of bravery and conduct, began to entertain apprehensions of

      the event; and remonstrated with the king, that it would be better policy

      to prolong the war; at least, to spare his own person in the action. He

      urged to him that the desperate situation of the duke of Normandy made it

      requisite for that prince to bring matters to a speedy decision, and put

      his whole fortune on the issue of a battle; but that the king of England,

      in his own country, beloved by his subjects, provided with every supply,

      had more certain and less dangerous means of insuring to himself the

      victory; that the Norman troops, elated on the one hand with the highest

      hopes, and seeing on the other no resource in case of a discomfiture,

      would fight to the last extremity; and being the flower of all the

      warriors of the continent, must be regarded as formidable to the English;

      that if their first fire, which is always the most dangerous, were allowed

      to languish for want of action, if they were harassed with small

      skirmishes, straitened in provisions, and fatigued with the bad weather

      and deep roads during the winter season which was approaching, they must

      fall an easy and a bloodless prey to their enemy; that if a general action

      were delayed, the English, sensible of the imminent danger to which their

      properties, as well as liberties, were exposed from those rapacious

      invaders, would hasten from all quarters to his assistance, and would

      render his army invincible; that, at least, if he thought it necessary to

      hazard a battle, he ought not to expose his own person out reserve, in

      case of disastrous accidents, some resource to the liberty and

      independence of the kingdom; and that having once been so unfortunate as

      to be constrained to swear, and that upon the holy relics, to support the

      pretensions of the duke of Normandy, it were better that the command of

      the army should be intrusted to another, who, not being bound by those

      sacred ties, might give the soldiers more assured hopes of a prosperous

      issue to the combat.

     

      Harold was deaf to all these remonstrances. Elated with his past

      prosperity, as well as stimulated by his native courage, he resolved to

      give battle in person; and for that purpose he drew near to the Normans,

      who had removed their camp and fleet to Hastings, where they fixed their

      quarters. He was so confident of success, that he sent a message to the

      duke, promising him a sum of money if he would depart the kingdom without

      effusion of blood; but his offer was rejected with disdain; and William,

      not to be behind with his enemy in vaunting, sent him a message by some

      monks, requiring him either to resign the kingdom, or to hold it of him in

      fealty, or to submit their cause to the arbitration of the pope, or to

      fight him in single combat. Harold replied, that the God of battles would

      soon be the arbiter of all their differences.[*]

     

      The English and Normans now prepared themselves for this important

      decision; but the aspect of things, on the night before the battle, was

      very different in the two camps. The English spent the time in riot, and

      jollity, and disorder; the Normans, in silence, and in prayer, and in the

      other functions of their religion.[**]

     

      On the morning, the duke called together the most considerable of his

      commanders, and made them a speech suitable to the occasion. He

      represented to them, that the event which they and he had long wished for,

      was approaching; the whole fortune of the war now depended on their

      swords, and would be decided in a single action; that never army had

      greater motives for exerting a vigorous courage, whether they considered

      the prize which would attend their victory, or the inevitable destruction

      which must ensue upon their discomfiture; that if their martial and

      veteran bands could once break those raw soldiers, who had rashly dared to

      approach them, they conquered a kingdom at one blow, and were justly

      entitled to all its possessions as the reward of their prosperous valor;

      that, on the contrary, if they remitted in the least their wonted prowess,

      an enraged enemy hung upon their rear, the sea met them in their retreat,

      and an ignominious death was the certain punishment of their imprudent

      cowardice; that by collecting so numerous and brave a host, he had insured

      every human means of conquest; and the commander of the enemy, by his

      criminal conduct, had given him just cause to hope for the favor of the

      Almighty, in whose hands alone lay the event of wars and battles; and that

      a perjured usurper, anathematized by the sovereign pontiff, and conscious

      of his own breach of faith would be struck with terror on their

      appearance, and would prognosticate to himself that fate which—his

      multiplied crimes had so justly merited.[*] The duke next divided his army

      into three lines: the first, led by Montgomery, consisted of archers and

      light-armed infantry; the second, commanded by Martel, was composed of his

      bravest battalions, heavy-armed, and ranged in close order; his cavalry,

      at whose head he placed himself, formed the third line, and were so

      disposed, that they stretched beyond the infantry, and flanked each wing

      of the army.[**] He ordered the signal of battle to be given; and the

      whole army, moving at once, and singing the hymn or song of Roland, the

      famous peer of Charlemagne,[***] advanced, in order and with alacrity,

      towards the enemy.

     

      Harold had seized the advantage of a rising ground, and having likewise

      drawn some trenches to secure his flanks, he resolved to stand upon the

      defensive, and to avoid all action with the cavalry, in which he was

      inferior. The Kentish men were placed in the van; a post which they had

      always claimed as their due: the Londoners guarded the standard; and the

      king himself, accompanied by his two valiant brothers, Gurth and Leofwin,

      dismounting, placed himself at the head of his infantry, and expressed his

      resolution to conquer or to perish in the action. The first attack of the

      Normans was desperate, but was received with equal valor by the English;

      and after a furious combat, which remained long undecided, the former,

      overcome by the difficulty of the ground, and hard pressed by the enemy,

      began first to relax their vigor, then to retreat; and confusion was

      spreading among the ranks; when William, who found himself on the brink of

      destruction, hastened, with a select band, to the relief of his dismayed

      forces. His presence restored the action; the English were obliged to

      retire with loss; and the duke, ordering his second line to advance,

      renewed the attack with fresh forces and with redoubled courage. Finding

      that the enemy aided by the advantage of ground, and animated by the

      example of their prince, still made a vigorous resistance, he tried a

      stratagem which was very delicate in its management, but which seemed

      advisable in his desperate situation, where, if he gained not a decisive

      victory, he was totally undone: he commanded his troops to make a hasty

      retreat, and to allure the enemy from their ground by the appearance of

      flight. The artifice succeeded against those unexperienced soldiers, who,

      heated by the action, and sanguine in their hopes, precipitately followed

      the Normans into the plain. William gave orders, that at once the infantry

      should face about upon their pursuers, and the cavalry make an assault

      upon their wings, and both of them pursue the advantage, which the

      surprise and terror of the enemy must give them in that critical and

      decisive moment. The English were repulsed with great slaughter, and

      driven back to the hill; where, being rallied by the bravery of Harold,

      they were able, notwithstanding their loss, to maintain the post and

      continue the combat. The duke tried the same stratagem a second time with

      the same success; but even after this double advantage, he still found a

      great body of the English, who, maintaining themselves in firm array,

      seemed determined to dispute the victory to the last extremity. He ordered

      his heavy-armed infantry to make an assault upon them; while his archers,

      placed behind, should gall the enemy, who were exposed by the situation of

      the ground, and who were intent in defending themselves against the swords

      and spears of the assailants. By this disposition he at last prevailed:

      Harold was slain by an arrow, while he was combating with great bravery at

      the head of his men; his two brothers shared the same fate; and the

      English, discouraged by the fall of those princes, gave ground on all

      sides, and were pursued with great slaughter by the victorious Normans. A

      few troops, however, of the vanquished had still the courage to turn upon

      their pursuers; and attacking them in deep and miry ground, obtained some

      revenge for the slaughter and dishonor of the day. But the appearance of

      the duke obliged them to seek their safety by flight; and darkness saved

      them from any further pursuit by the enemy.

     

      Thus was gained by William, duke of Normandy, the great and decisive

      victory of Hastings, after a battle which was fought from morning till

      sunset, and which seemed worthy, by the heroic valor displayed by both

      armies and by both commanders, to decide the fate of a mighty kingdom.

      William had three horses killed under him; and there fell near fifteen

      thousand men on the side of the Normans: the loss was still more

      considerable on that of the vanquished, besides the death of the king and

      his two brothers. The dead body of Harold was brought to William, and was

      generously restored without ransom to his mother. The Norman army left not

      the field of battle without giving thanks to Heaven, in the most solemn

      manner, for their victory: and the prince, having refreshed his troops,

      prepared to push to the utmost his advantage against the divided,

      dismayed, and discomfited English
