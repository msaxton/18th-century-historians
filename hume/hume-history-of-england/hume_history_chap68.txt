The king, observing that the whole nation concurred at first in the belief

and prosecution of the Popish plot, had found it necessary for his own

safety to pretend, in all public speeches and transactions, an entire

belief and acquiescence in that famous absurdity; and by this artifice he

had eluded the violent and irresistible torrent of the people. When a

little time and recollection, as well as the execution of the pretended

conspirators, had somewhat moderated the general fury, he was now enabled

to form a considerable party, devoted to the interests of the crown, and

determined to oppose the pretensions of the malecontents.

 

In every mixed government, such as that of England, the bulk of the nation

will always incline to preserve the entire frame of the constitution; but

according to the various prejudices, interests, and dispositions of men,

some will ever attach themselves with more passion to the regal, others to

the popular part of the government. Though the king, after his

restoration, had endeavored to abolish the distinction of parties, and had

chosen his ministers from among all denominations, no sooner had he lost

his popularity, and exposed himself to general jealousy, than he found it

necessary to court the old cavalier party, and to promise them full

compensation for that neglect of which they had hitherto complained. The

present emergence made it still more necessary for him to apply for their

support; and there were many circumstances which determined them, at this

time, to fly to the assistance of the crown, and to the protection of the

royal family.

 

A party strongly attached to monarchy will naturally be jealous of the

right of succession, by which alone they believe stability to be preserved

in the government, and a barrier fixed against the encroachments of

popular assemblies. The project, openly embraced, of excluding the duke,

appeared to that party a dangerous innovation: and the design, secretly

projected, of advancing Monmouth, made them apprehensive, lest the

inconveniencies of a disputed succession should be propagated to all

posterity. While the jealous lovers of liberty maintained, that a king,

whose title depended on the parliament, would naturally be more attentive

to the interests, at least to the humors of the people, the passionate

admirers of monarchy considered all dependence as a degradation of kingly

government, and a great step towards the establishment of a commonwealth

in England.

 

But though his union with the political royalists brought great accession

of force to the king, he derived no less support from the confederacy

which he had at this time the address to form with the church of England.

He represented to the ecclesiastics the great number of Presbyterians and

other sectaries, who had entered into the popular party; the encouragement

and favor which they met with; the loudness of their cries with regard to

Popery and arbitrary power. And he made the established clergy and their

adherents apprehend, that the old scheme for the abolition of prelacy as

well as monarchy was revived, and that the same miseries and oppressions

awaited them, to which, during the civil wars and usurpations, they had so

long been exposed.

 

The memory also of those dismal times united many indifferent and

impartial persons to the crown, and begat a dread lest the zeal for

liberty should ingraft itself on fanaticism, and should once more kindle a

civil war in the kingdom. Had not the king still retained the prerogative

of dissolving the parliament, there was indeed reason to apprehend the

renewal of all the pretensions and violences which had ushered in the last

commotions. The one period appeared an exact counterpart to the other: but

still discerning judges could perceive, both in the spirit of the parties

and in the genius of the prince, a material difference; by means of which

Charles was enabled at last, though with the imminent peril’ of liberty,

to preserve the peace of the nation.

 

The cry against Popery was loud; but it proceeded less from religious than

from party zeal, in those who propagated, and even in those who adopted

it. The spirit of enthusiasm had occasioned so much mischief, and had been

so successfully exploded, that it was not possible, by any artifice, again

to revive and support it. Cant had been ridiculed, hypocrisy detected; the

pretensions to a more thorough reformation, and to greater purity, had

become suspicious; and instead of denominating themselves the godly party,

the appellation affected at the beginning of the civil wars, the present

patriots were content with calling themselves the good and the honest

party;[*] a sure prognostic that their measures were not to be so furious

nor their pretensions so exorbitant.

 

The king too, though not endowed with the integrity and strict principles

of his father, was happy in a more amiable manner and more popular

address. Far from being distant stately, or reserved, he had not a grain

of pride or vanity in his whole composition;[**] but was the most affable,

best bred man alive. He treated his subjects like noblemen, like

gentlemen, like freemen; not like vassals or boors. His professions were

plausible, his whole behavior engaging; so that he won upon the hearts,

even while he lost the good opinion of his subjects, and often balanced

their judgment of things by their personal inclination.[***] In his public

conduct likewise, though he had sometimes embraced measures dangerous to

the liberty and religion of his people, he had never been found to

persevere obstinately in them, but had always returned into that path

which their united opinion seemed to point out to him. And upon the whole,

it appeared to many cruel, and even iniquitous, to remark too rigorously

the failings of a prince who discovered so much facility in correcting his

errors, and so much lenity in pardoning the offences committed against

himself.

 

The general affection borne the king appeared signally about this time. He

fell sick at Windsor; and had two or three fits of a fever, so violent as

made his life be thought in danger. A general consternation seized all

ranks of men increased by the apprehensions entertained of his successor

In the present disposition of men’s minds, the king’s death, to use an

expression of Sir William Temple,[****] was regarded as the end of the

world. The malecontents, it was feared, would proceed to extremities, and

immediately kindle a civil war in the kingdom.

 

Either their entire success, or entire failure, or even the balance and

contest of parties, seemed all of them events equally fatal. The king’s

chief counsellors, therefore Essex, Halifax, and Sunderland, who stood on

bad terms with Shaftesbury and the popular party, advised him to send

secretly for the duke, that, in case of any sinister accident, that prince

might be ready to assert his right against the opposition which he was

likely to meet with. When the duke arrived, he found his brother out of

danger; and it was agreed to conceal the invitation which he had received.

His journey, however, was attended with important consequences. He

prevailed on the king to disgrace Monmouth, whose projects were now known

and avowed; to deprive him of his command in the army; and to send him

beyond sea. He himself returned to Brussels; but made a short stay in that

place. He obtained leave to retire to Scotland, under pretence still of

quieting the apprehensions of the English nation; but in reality with a

view of securing that kingdom in his interests.

 

Though Essex and Halifax had concurred in the resolution of inviting over

the duke, they soon found that they had not obtained his confidence, and

that even the king, while he made use of their service, had no sincere

regard for their persons. Essex in disgust resigned the treasury: Halifax

retired to his country seat: Temple, despairing of any accommodation among

such enraged parties, withdrew almost entirely to his books and his

gardens. The king, who changed ministers as well as measures with great

indifference, bestowed at this time his chief confidence on Hyde,

Sunderland, and Godolphin. Hyde succeeded Essex in the treasury.

 

All the king’s ministers, as well as himself, were extremely averse to the

meeting of the new parliament, which they expected to find as refractory

as any of the preceding. The elections had gone mostly in favor of the

country party. The terrors of the plot had still a mighty influence over

the populace; and the apprehensions of the duke’s bigoted principles and

arbitrary character weighed with men of sense and reflection. The king

therefore resolved to prorogue the parliament, that he might try whether

time would allay those humors, which, by every other, expedient, he had in

vain attempted to mollify. In this measure he did not expect the

concurrence of his council. He knew that those, popular leaders, whom he

had admitted, would zealously oppose a resolution which disconcerted all

their schemes; and that the royalists would not dare, by supporting it, to

expose themselves to the vengeance of the parliament, when it should be

assembled. These reasons obliged him to take this step entirely of

himself; and he only declared his resolution in council. It is remarkable

that, though the king had made profession never to embrace any measure

without the advice of these counsellors, he had often broken that

resolution, and had been necessitated, in affairs of the greatest

consequence, to control their opinion. Many of them in disgust threw up

about this time; particularly Lord Russel, the most popular man in the

nation, as well from the mildness and integrity of his character, as from

his zealous attachment to the religion and liberties of his country.

Though carried into some excesses, his intentions were ever esteemed

upright; and being heir to the greatest fortune in the kingdom, as well as

void of ambition, men believed that nothing but the last necessity could

ever engage him to embrace any desperate measures. Shaftesbury, who was,

in most particulars, of an opposite character, was removed by the king

from the office of president of the council; and the earl of Radnor, a man

who possessed whimsical talents and splenetic virtues, was substituted in

his place.

 

It was the favor and countenance of the parliament which had chiefly

encouraged the rumor of plots; but the nation had gotten so much into that

vein of credulity, and every necessitous villain was so much incited by

the success of Oates and Bedloe, that even during the prorogation the

people were not allowed to remain in tranquillity. There was one

Dangerfield, a fellow who had been burned in the hand for crimes,

transported, whipped, pilloried four times, fined for cheats, outlawed for

felony, convicted of coining, and exposed to all the public infamy which

the laws could inflict on the basest and most shameful enormities. The

credulity of the people, and the humor of the times, enabled even this man

to become a person of consequence. He was the author of a new incident

called the meal-tub plot, from the place where some papers relating to it

were found. The bottom of this affair it is difficult and not very

material to discover. It only appears, that Dangerfield, under pretence of

betraying the conspiracies of the Presbyterians, had been countenanced by

some Catholics of condition, and had even been admitted to the duke’s

presence and the king’s; and that under pretence of revealing new Popish

plots, he had obtained access to Shaftesbury and some of the popular

leaders. Which side he intended to cheat, is uncertain; or whether he did

not rather mean to cheat both: but he soon found, that the belief of the

nation was more open to a Popish than a Presbyterian plot; and he resolved

to strike in with the prevailing humor. Though no weight could be laid on

his testimony, great clamor was raised; as if the court, by way of

retaliation, had intended to load the Presbyterians with the guilt of a

false conspiracy It must be confessed, that the present period, by the

prevalence and suspicion of such mean and ignoble arts on all sides,

throws a great stain on the British annals.

 

One of the most innocent artifices practised by party men at this time,

was the additional ceremony, pomp, and expense, with which a pope-burning

was celebrated in London: the spectacle served to entertain, and amuse,

and inflame the populace. The duke of Monmouth likewise came over without

leave, and made a triumphant procession through many parts of the kingdom,

extremely caressed and admired by the people. All these arts seemed

requisite to support the general prejudices during the long interval of

parliament. Great endeavors were also used to obtain the king’s consent

for the meeting of that assembly.

 

1680

 

Seventeen peers presented a petition to this purpose. Many of the

corporations imitated the example. Notwithstanding several marks of

displeasure, and even a menacing proclamation from the king, petitions

came from all parts, earnestly insisting on a session of parliament. The

danger of Popery, and the terrors of the plot, were never forgotten in any

of these addresses.

 

Tumultuous petitioning was one of the chief artifices by which the

malecontents in the last reign had attacked the own: and though the manner

of subscribing and delivering petitions was now somewhat regulated by act

of parliament, the thing itself still remained; and was an admirable

expedient for infesting the court, for spreading discontent, and for

uniting the nation in any popular clamor. As the king found no law by

which he could punish those importunate, and, as he deemed them, undutiful

solicitations, he was obliged to encounter them by popular applications of

a contrary tendency Wherever the church and court party prevailed,

addresses were framed, containing expressions of the highest regard to his

majesty, the most entire acquiescence in his wisdom, the most dutiful

submission to his prerogative, and the deepest abhorrence of those who

endeavored to encroach upon it, by prescribing to him any time for

assembling the parliament. Thus the nation came to be distinguished into

petitioners and abhorrers. Factions indeed were at this time extremely

animated against each other. The very names by which each party

denominated its antagonist, discover the virulence and rancor which

prevailed. For besides petitioner and abhorrer, appellations which were

soon forgotten, this year is remarkable for being the epoch of the

well-known epithets of “whig” and “tory”, by which, and sometimes without

any material difference, this island has been so long divided. The court

party reproached their antagonists with their affinity to the fanatical

conventiclers in Scotland, who were known by the name of whigs: the

country party found a resemblance between the courtiers and the Popish

banditti in Ireland, to whom the appellation of tory was affixed. And

after this manner these foolish terms of reproach came into public and

general use; and even at present seem not nearer their end than when they

were first invented.

 

The king used every art to encourage his partisans, and to reconcile the

people to his government. He persevered in the great zeal which he

affected against Popery. He even allowed several priests to be put to

death, for no other crime than their having received orders in the Romish

church. It is singular, that one of them, called Evans, was playing at

tennis when the warrant for his immediate execution was notified to him:

he swore that he would play out his set first. Charles, with the same view

of acquiring popularity, formed an alliance with Spain, and also offered

an alliance to Holland: but the Dutch, terrified with the great power of

France, and seeing little resource in a country so distracted as England,

declined acceptance. He had sent for the duke from Scotland; but desired

him to return, when the time of assembling the parliament began to

approach.

 

It was of great consequence to the popular party, while the meeting of

parliament depended on the king’s will, to keep the law, whose operations

are perpetual, entirely on their side. The sheriffs of London by their

office return the juries: it had been usual for the mayor to nominate one

sheriff by drinking to him; and the common hall had ever, without dispute,

confirmed the mayor’s choice. Sir Robert Clayton, the mayor, appointed one

who was not acceptable to the popular party: the common hall rejected him;

and Bethel and Cornish, two Independents and republicans, and of

consequence deeply engaged with the malecontents, were chosen by a

majority of voices. In spite of all remonstrances and opposition, the

citizens persisted in their choice; and the court party was obliged for

the present to acquiesce.

 

Juries, however, were not so partial in the city, but that reason and

justice, even when the Popish plot was in question, could sometimes

prevail. The earl of Castlemaine, husband to the duchess of Cleveland, was

acquitted about this time, though accused by Oates and Dangerfield of an

intention to assassinate the king. Sir Thomas Gascoigne, a very aged

gentleman in the north, being accused by two servants, whom he had

dismissed for dishonesty, received a like verdict. These trials were great

blows to the plot, which now began to stagger, in the judgment of most

men, except those who were entirely devoted to the country party. But in

order still to keep alive the zeal against Popery, the earl of Shaftesbury

appeared in Westminster Hall, attended by the earl of Huntingdon, the

lords Russel, Cavendish, Grey, Brandon, Sir Henry Caverly, Sir Gilbert

Gerrard, Sir William Cooper, and other persons of distinction, and

presented to the grand jury of Middlesex reasons for indicting the duke of

York as a Popish recusant. While the jury were deliberating on this

extraordinary presentment, the chief justice sent for them, and suddenly,

even somewhat irregularly, dismissed them. Shaftesbury, however, obtained

the end for which he had undertaken this bold measure: he showed to all

his followers the desperate resolution which he had embraced, never to

admit of any accommodation or composition with the duke. By such daring

conduct he gave them assurance, that he was fully determined not to desert

their cause; and he engaged them to a like devoted perseverance in all the

measures which he should suggest to them.

 

As the kingdom was regularly and openly divided into two zealous parties,

it was not difficult for the king to know, that the majority of the new

house of commons was engaged in interests opposite to the court: but that

he might leave no expedient untried, which could compose the unhappy

differences among his subjects, he resolved at last, after a long

interval, to assemble the parliament. In his speech he told them, that the

several prorogations which he had made had been very advantageous to his

neighbors, and very useful to himself: that he had employed that interval

in perfecting with the crown of Spain an alliance which had often been

desired by former parliaments, and which, he doubted not, would be

extremely agreeable to them: that, in order to give weight to this

measure, and render it beneficial to Christendom, it was necessary to

avoid all domestic dissensions, and to unite themselves firmly in the same

views and purposes: that he was determined, that nothing on his part

should be wanting to such a salutary end; and provided the succession were

preserved in its due and legal course, he would concur in any expedient

for the security of the protestant religion, that the further examination

of the Popish plot, and the punishment of the criminals, were requisite

for the safety both of king and kingdom; and after recommending to them

the necessity of providing, by some supplies, for the safety of Tangiers,

he proceeded in these words: “But that which I value above all the

treasure in the world, and which I am sure will give us greater strength

and reputation both at home and abroad than any treasure can do, is a

perfect union among ourselves. Nothing but this can restore the kingdom to

that strength and vigor which it seems to have lost, and raise us again to

that consideration which England hath usually possessed. All Europe have

their eyes upon this assembly, and think their own happiness and misery,

as well as ours, will depend upon it. If we should be so unhappy as to

fall into misunderstandings among ourselves to that degree as would render

our friendship unsafe to trust to, will not be wondered at, if our

neighbors should begin to take new resolutions, and perhaps such as may be

fatal to us. Let us therefore take care, that we do not gratify our

enemies, and discourage our friends, by any unseasonable disputes. If any

such do happen, the world will see that it is no fault of mine; for I have

done all that it was possible for me to do, to keep you in peace while I

live, and to leave you so when I die. But from so great prudence and so

good affection as yours, I can fear nothing of this kind; but do rely upon

you all, that you will do your best endeavors to bring this parliament to

a good and happy conclusion.”

  

All these mollifying expressions had no influence with the commons. Every

step which they took betrayed the zeal with which they were animated. They

voted, that it was the undoubted right of the subject to petition the king

for the calling and sitting of parliament. Not content with this decision,

which seems justifiable in a mixed monarchy, they fell with the utmost

violence on all those abhorrers, who in their addresses to the crown, had

expressed their disapprobation of those petitions. They did not reflect,

that it was as lawful for one party of men as for another to express their

sense of public affairs; and that the best established right may, in

particular circumstances, be abused, and even the exercise of it become an

object of abhorrence. For this offence they expelled Sir Thomas Withens.

They appointed a committee for further inquiry into such members as had

been guilty of a like crime, and complaints were lodged against Lord

Paston, Sir Robert Malverer, Sir Bryan Stapleton, Taylor, and Turner. They

addressed the king against Sir George Jefferies, recorder of London, for

his activity in the same cause; and they frightened him into a resignation

of his office, in which he was succeeded by Sir George Treby, a great

leader of the popular party. They voted an impeachment against North,

chief justice of the common pleas, for drawing the proclamation against

tumultuous petitions; but upon examination found the proclamation so

cautiously worded, that it afforded them no handle against him. A petition

had been presented to the king from Taunton. “How dare you deliver me such

a paper?” said the king to the person who presented it. “Sir,” replied he,

“my name is DARE.” For this saucy reply, but under other pretences, he had

been tried, fined, and committed to prison. The commons now addressed the

king for his liberty, and for remitting his fine. Some printers also and

authors of seditious libels they took under their protection.

 

Great numbers of the abhorrers, from all parts of England, were seized by

order of the commons, and committed to custody. The liberty of the

subject, which had been so carefully guarded by the Great Charter, and by

the late law of habeas corpus, was every day violated by their arbitrary

and capricious commitments. The chief jealousy, it is true, of the English

constitution is naturally and justly directed against the crown; nor

indeed have the commons any other means of securing their privileges than

by commitments, which, as they cannot beforehand be exactly determined by

law, must always appear in some degree arbitrary. Sensible of these

reasons, the people had hitherto, without murmuring, seen this

discretionary power exercised by the house: but as it was now carried to

excess, and was abused to serve the purposes of faction, great complaints

against it were heard from all quarters. At last, the vigor and courage of

one Stowel of Exeter, an abhorrer, put an end to the practice. He refused

to obey the serjeant at arms, stood upon his defence, and said that he

knew of no law by which they pretended to commit him. The house, finding

it equally dangerous to proceed or to recede, got off by an evasion: they

inserted in their votes, that Stowel was indisposed, and that a month’s

time was allowed him for the recovery of his health.

 

But the chief violence of the house of commons appeared in all their

transactions with regard to the plot, which they prosecuted with the same

zeal and the same credulity as their predecessors. They renewed the former

vote, which affirmed the reality of the horrid Popish plot; and, in order

the more to terrify the people, they even asserted that, notwithstanding

the discovery, the plot still subsisted. They expelled Sir Robert Can and

Sir Robert Yeomans, who had been complained of for saying, that there was

no Popish, but there was a Presbyterian plot. And they greatly lamented

the death of Bedloe, whom they called a material witness, and on whose

testimony they much depended. He had been seized with a fever at Bristol;

had sent for Chief Justice North; confirmed all his former evidence,

except that with regard to the duke and the queen; and desired North to

apply to the king for some money to relieve him in his necessities. A few

days after, he expired; and the whole party triumphed extremely in these

circumstances of his death: as if such a testimony could be deemed the

affirmation of a dying man; as if his confession of perjury in some

instances could assure his veracity in the rest; and as if the

perseverance of one profligate could outweigh the last words of so many

men, guilty of no crime but that of Popery.

 

The commons even endeavored, by their countenance and protection, to

remove the extreme infamy with which Dangerfield was loaded, and to

restore him to the capacity of being an evidence. The whole tribe of

informers they applauded and rewarded: Jennison, Turberville, Dugdale,

Smith, La Faria, appeared before them; and their testimony, however

frivolous or absurd, met with a favorable reception: the king was applied

to in their behalf for pensions and pardons: their narratives were printed

with that sanction which arose from the approbation of the house: Dr.

Tongue was recommended for the first considerable church preferment which

should become vacant. Considering men’s determined resolution to believe,

instead of admiring that a palpable falsehood should be maintained by

witnesses, it may justly appear wonderful, that no better evidence was

ever produced against the Catholics.

 

The principal reasons which still supported the clamor of the Popish plot,

were the apprehensions entertained by the people of the duke of York, and

the resolution embraced by their leaders of excluding him from the throne.

Shaftesbury, and many considerable men of the party, had rendered

themselves irreconcilable with him, and could find their safety no way but

in his ruin. Monmouth’s friends hoped, that the exclusion of that prince

would make way for their patron. The resentment against the duke’s

apostasy, the love of liberty, the zeal for religion, the attachment to

faction; all these motives incited the country party. And above all, what

supported the resolution of adhering to the exclusion, and rejecting all

other expedients offered, was the hope, artfully encouraged, that the king

would at last be obliged to yield to their demand. His revenues were

extremely burdened; and, even if free, could scarcely suffice for the

necessary charges of government, much less for that pleasure and expense

to which he was inclined. Though he had withdrawn his countenance from

Monmouth, he was known secretly to retain a great affection for him. On no

occasion had he ever been found to persist obstinately against

difficulties and importunity. And as his beloved mistress, the duchess of

Portsmouth, had been engaged, either from lucrative views, or the hopes of

making the succession fall on her own children, to unite herself with the

popular party, this incident was regarded as a favorable prognostic of

their success. Sunderland, secretary of state, who had linked his interest

with that of the duchess, had concurred in the same measure.

 

But besides friendship for his brother, and a regard to the right of

succession, there were many strong reasons which had determined Charles to

persevere in opposing the exclusion. All the royalists and the devotees to

the church, that party by which alone monarchy was supported, regarded the

right of succession as inviolable; and if abandoned by the king in so

capital an article, it was to be feared that they would, in their turn,

desert his cause, and deliver him over to the pretensions and usurpations

of the country party. The country party, or the whigs, as they were

called, if they did not still retain some propensity towards a republic,

were at least affected with a violent jealousy of regal power; and it was

equally to be dreaded, that being enraged with past opposition, and

animated by present success, they would, if they prevailed in this

pretension, be willing as well as able to reduce the prerogative within

very narrow limits. All menaces therefore, all promises, were in vain

employed against the king’s resolution: he never would be prevailed on to

desert his friends, and put himself into the hands of his enemies. And

having voluntarily made such important concessions, and tendered, over and

over again, such strong limitations, he was well pleased to find them

rejected by the obstinacy of the commons; and hoped that, after the spirit

of opposition had spent itself in fruitless violence, the time would come,

when he might safely appeal against his parliament to his people.

 

So much were the popular leaders determined to carry matters to

extremities, that in less than a week after the commencement of the

session, a motion was made for bringing in an exclusion bill, and a

committee was appointed for that purpose. This bill differed in nothing

from the former, but in two articles, which showed still an increase of

zeal in the commons: the bill was to be read to the people twice a year in

all the churches of the kingdom; and every one who should support the

duke’s title, was rendered incapable of receiving a pardon but by act of

parliament.

 

The debates were carried on with great violence on both sides. The bill

was defended by Sir William Jones, who had now resigned his office of

attorney-general, by Lord Russel, by Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry

Capel, Sir William Pulteney, by Colonel Titus, Treby, Hambden, Montague.

It was opposed by Sir Leoline Jenkins, secretary of state, Sir John

Ernley, chancellor of the exchequer, by Hyde, Seymour, Temple. The

arguments transmitted to us may be reduced to the following topics.

 

In every government, said the exclusionists, there is some-where an

authority absolute and supreme; nor can any determination, how unusual

soever, which receives the sanction of the legislature, admit afterwards

of dispute or control. The liberty of a constitution, so far from

diminishing this absolute power, seems rather to add force to it, and to

give it greater influence over the people. The more members of the state

concur in any legislative decision, and the more free their voice, the

less likelihood is there that any opposition will be made to those

measures which receive the final sanction of their authority. In England,

the legislative power is lodged in king, lords, and commons, which

comprehend every order of the community; and there is no pretext for

exempting any circumstance of government, not even the succession of the

crown, from so full and decisive a jurisdiction. Even express declarations

have, in this particular, been made of parliamentary authority: instances

have occurred where it has been exerted; and though prudential reasons may

justly be alleged, why such innovations should not be attempted but on

extraordinary occasions, the power and right are forever vested in the

community. But if any occasion can be deemed extraordinary, if any

emergence can require unusual expedients, it is the present; when the heir

to the crown has renounced the religion of the state, and has zealously

embraced a faith totally hostile and incompatible. A prince of that

communion can never put trust in a people so prejudiced against him: the

people must be equally diffident of such a prince: foreign and destructive

alliances will seem to one the only protection of his throne: perpetual

jealousy, opposition, faction, even insurrections will be employed by the

other as the sole securities for their liberty and religion. Though

theological principles, when set in opposition to passions, have often

small influence on mankind in general, still less on princes, yet when

they become symbols of faction, and marks of party distinctions, they

concur with one of the strongest passions in the human frame, and are then

capable of carrying men to the greatest extremities. Notwithstanding the

better judgment and milder disposition of the king, how much has the

influence of the duke already disturbed the tenor of government! how often

engaged the nation into measures totally destructive of their foreign

interests and honor, of their domestic repose and tranquillity! The more

the absurdity and incredibility of the Popish plot are insisted on, the

stronger reason it affords for the exclusion of the duke; since the

universal belief of it discovers the extreme antipathy of the nation to

his religion, and the utter impossibility of ever bringing them to

acquiesce peaceably under the dominion of such a sovereign. The prince,

finding himself in so perilous a situation, must seek for security by

desperate remedies, and by totally subduing the privileges of a nation,

which had betrayed such hostile dispositions towards himself, and towards

every thing which he deems the most sacred. It is in vain to propose

limitations and expedients. Whatever share of authority is left in the

duke’s hands, will be employed to the destruction of the nation; and even

the additional restraints, by discovering the public diffidence and

aversion, will serve him as incitements to put himself in a condition

entirely superior and independent. And as the laws of England still make

resistance treason, and neither do nor can admit of any positive

exceptions, what folly to leave the kingdom in so perilous and absurd a

situation, where the greatest virtue will be exposed to the most severe

proscription, and where the laws can only be saved by expedients, which

these same laws have declared the highest crime and enormity!

 

The court party reasoned in an opposite manner. An authority, they said,

wholly absolute and uncontrollable is a mere chimera, and is nowhere to be

found in any human institutions. All government is founded on opinion and

a sense of duty; and wherever the supreme magistrate, by any law or

positive prescription, shocks an opinion regarded as fundamental, and

established with a firmness equal to that of his own authority, he

subverts the principle by which he himself is established, and can no

longer hope for obedience. In European monarchies, the right of succession

is justly esteemed a fundamental; and even though the whole legislature be

vested in a single person, it would never be permitted him, by an edict,

to disinherit his lawful heir, and call a stranger or more distant

relation to the throne. Abuses in other parts of government are capable of

redress, from more dispassionate inquiry or better information of the

sovereign, and till then ought patiently to be endured: but violations of

the right of succession draw such terrible consequences after them, as are

not to be paralleled by any other grievance or inconvenience. Vainly is it

pleaded that England is a mixed monarchy; and that a law, assented to by

king, lords, and commons, is enacted by the concurrence of every part of

the state: it is plain, that there remains a very powerful party, who may

indeed be outvoted, but who never will deem a law, subversive of

hereditary right, anywise valid or obligatory. Limitations, such as are

proposed by the king, give no shock to the constitution, which, in many

particulars, is already limited; and they may be so calculated as to serve

every purpose sought for by an exclusion. If the ancient barriers against

regal authority have been able, during so many ages, to remain

impregnable, how much more those additional ones, which, by depriving the

monarch of power, tend so far to their own security? The same jealousy too

of religion, which has engaged the people to lay these restraints upon the

successor, will extremely lessen the number of his partisans, and make it

utterly impracticable for him, either by force or artifice, to break the

fetters imposed upon him. The king’s age and vigorous state of health

promise him a long life; and can it be prudent to tear in pieces the whole

state, in order to provide against a contingency which, it is very likely,

may never happen? No human schemes can secure the public in all possible,

imaginable events; and the bill of exclusion itself however accurately

framed, leaves room for obvious and natural suppositions, to which it

pretends not to provide any remedy. Should the duke have a son after the

king’s death must that son, without any default of his own forfeit his

title? or must the princess of Orange descend from the throne, in order to

give place to the lawful successor? But were all these reasonings false,

it still remains to be considered that, in public deliberations, we seek

not the expedient which is best in itself, but the best of such as are

practicable. The king willingly consents to limitations, and has already

offered some which are of the utmost importance: but he is determined to

endure any extremity rather than allow the right of succession to be

invaded. Let us beware of that factious violence, which leads to demand

more than will be granted; lest we lose the advantage of those beneficial

concessions, and leave the nation, on the king’s demise, at the mercy of a

zealous prince, irritated with the ill usage which, he imagines, he has

already met with.

 

In the house of commons, the reasoning of the exclusionists appeared the

more convincing; and the bill passed by a great majority. It was in the

house of peers that the king expected to oppose it with success. The court

party was there so prevalent, that it was carried only by a majority of

two to pay so much regard to the bill as even to commit it. When it came

to be debated, the contest was violent. Shaftesbury, Sunderland, and Essex

argued for it; Halifax chiefly conducted the debate against it, and

displayed an extent of capacity and a force of eloquence which had never

been surpassed in that assembly. He was animated, as well by the greatness

of the occasion, as by a rivalship with his uncle Shaftesbury; whom,

during that day’s debate, he seemed, in the judgment of all, to have

totally eclipsed. The king was present during the whole debate, which was

prolonged till eleven at night. The bill was thrown out by a considerable

majority. All the bishops, except three, voted against it. Besides the

influence of the court over them, the church of England, they imagined or

pretended, was in greater danger from the prevalence of Presbyterianism

than of Popery, which, though favored by the duke, and even by the king

was extremely repugnant to the genius of the nation.

 

The commons discovered much ill humor upon this disappointment. They

immediately voted an address for the removal of Halifax from the king’s

councils and presence forever. Though the pretended cause was his advising

the late frequent prorogations of parliament, the real reason was

apparently his vigorous opposition to the exclusion bill. When the king

applied for money to enable him to maintain Tangiers, which he declared

his present revenues totally unable to defend, instead of complying, they

voted such an address as was in reality a remonstrance, and one little

less violent than that famous remonstrance which ushered in the civil

wars. All the abuses of government, from the beginning almost of the

reign, are there insisted on; the Dutch war, the alliance with France, the

prorogations and dissolutions of parliament; and as all these measures, as

well as the damnable and hellish plot, are there ascribed to the

machinations of Papists, it was plainly insinuated, that the king had, all

along, lain under the influence of that party, and was in reality the

chief conspirator against the religion and liberties of his people.

 

The commons, though they conducted the great business of the exclusion

with extreme violence, and even imprudence, had yet much reason for the

jealousy which gave rise to it: but their vehement prosecution of the

Popish plot, even after so long an interval, discovers such a spirit,

either of credulity or injustice, as admits of no apology. The impeachment

of the Catholic lords in the Tower was revived; and as Viscount Stafford,

from his age, infirmities, and narrow capacity, was deemed the least

capable of defending himself, it was determined to make him the first

victim, that his condemnation might pave the way for a sentence against

the rest. The chancellor, now created earl of Nottingham, was appointed

high steward for conducting the trial.

 

Three witnesses were produced against the prisoner; Oates, Dugdale, and

Turberville. Oates swore, that he saw Fenwick the Jesuit, deliver to

Stafford a commission signed by De Oliva, general of the Jesuits,

appointing him paymaster to the Papal army, which was to be levied for the

subduing of England; for this ridiculous imposture still maintained its

credit with the commons. Dugdale gave testimony, that the prisoner, at

Tixal; a seat of Lord Aston’s, had endeavored to engage him in the design

of murdering the king; and had promised him, besides the honor of being

sainted by the church, a reward of five hundred pounds for that service.

Turberville deposed, that the prisoner, in his own house at Paris, had

made him a like proposal. To offer money for murdering a king, without

laying down any scheme by which the assassin may insure some probability

or possibility of escape, is so incredible in itself, and may so easily be

maintained by any prostitute evidence, that an accusation of that nature,

not accompanied with circumstances, ought very little to be attended to by

any court of judicature. But notwithstanding the small hold which the

witnesses afforded, the prisoner was able, in many material particulars,

to discredit their testimony. It was sworn by Dugdale, that Stafford had

assisted in a great consult of the Catholics held at Tixal; but Stafford

proved by undoubted testimony, that at the time assigned he was in Bath,

and in that neighborhood. Turberville had served a novitiate among the

Dominicans; but having deserted the convent, he had enlisted as a trooper

in the French army; and being dismissed that service, he now lived in

London, abandoned by all his relations, and exposed to great poverty.

Stafford proved, by the evidence of his gentleman and his page, that

Turberville had never, either at Paris or at London, been seen in his

company; and it might justly appear strange, that a person who had so

important a secret in his keeping, was so long entirely neglected by him.

 

The clamor and outrage of the populace, during the trial, were extreme:

great abilities and eloquence were displayed by the managers, Sir William

Jones, Sir Francis Winnington, and Serjeant Maynard: yet did the prisoner,

under all these disadvantages, make a better defence than was expected,

either by his friends or his enemies: the unequal contest in which he was

engaged, was a plentiful source of compassion to every mind seasoned with

humanity. He represented that, during a course of forty years, from the

very commencement of the civil wars, he had, through many dangers,

difficulties, and losses, still maintained his loyalty: and was it

credible, that now, in his old age, easy in his circumstances, but

dispirited by infirmities, he would belie the whole course of his life,

and engage against his royal master, from whom he had ever received kind

treatment, in the most desperate and most bloody of all conspiracies? He

remarked the infamy of the witnesses; the contradictions and absurdities

of their testimony; the extreme indigence in which they had lived, though

engaged, as they pretended, in a conspiracy with kings, princes, and

nobles; the credit and opulence to which they were at present raised. With

a simplicity and tenderness more persuasive than the greatest oratory, he

still made protestations of his innocence; and could not forbear, every

moment, expressing the most lively surprise and indignation at the

audacious impudence of the witnesses.

 

It will appear astonishing to us, as it did to Stafford himself, that the

peers, after a solemn trial of six days, should by a majority of

twenty-four voices, give sentence against him. He received, however, with

resignation, the fatal verdict. “God’s holy name be praised,” was the only

exclamation which he uttered. When the high steward told him, that the

peers would intercede with the king for remitting the more cruel and

ignominious parts of the sentence, hanging and quartering, he burst into

tears; but he told the lords, that he was moved to this weakness by his

sense of their goodness, not by any terror of that fate which he was

doomed to suffer.

 

It is remarkable that, after Charles, as is usual in such cases, had

remitted to Stafford the hanging and quartering, the two Sheriffs, Bethel

and Cornish, indulging their own republican humor, and complying with the

prevalent spirit of their party, over jealous of Monarchy, started a doubt

with regard to the king’s power of exercising even this small degree of

lenity. “Since he cannot pardon the whole,” said they, “how can he have

power to remit any part of the sentence?” They proposed the doubt to both

houses: the peers pronounced it superfluous; and even the commons,

apprehensive lest a question of this nature might make way for Stafford’s

escape, gave this singular answer: “This house is content, that the

sheriffs do execute William late Viscount Stafford by severing his head

from his body only.” Nothing can be a stronger proof of the fury of the

times, than that Lord Russel, notwithstanding the virtue and humanity of

his character, seconded in the house this barbarous scruple of the

Sheriffs.

 

In the interval between the sentence and execution, many efforts were made

to shake the resolution of the infirm and aged prisoner, and to bring him

to some confession of the treason for which he was condemned. It was even

rumored that he had confessed; and the zealous partymen, who, no doubt,

had secretly, notwithstanding their credulity, entertained some doubts

with regard to the reality of the Popish conspiracy, expressed great

triumph on the occasion. But Stafford, when again called before the house

of peers, discovered many schemes, which had been laid by himself and

others, for procuring a toleration to the Catholics, at least a mitigation

of the penal laws enacted against them: and he protested, that this was

the sole treason of which he had ever been guilty.

 

Stafford now prepared himself for death with the intrepidity which became

his birth and station, and which was the natural result of the innocence

and integrity which, during the course of a long life, he had ever

maintained: his mind seemed even to collect new force from the violence

and oppression under which he labored. When going to execution, he called

for a cloak to defend him against the rigor of the season. “Perhaps,” said

he, “I may shake with cold; but, I trust in God, not for fear.” On the

scaffold, he continued, with reiterated and earnest asseverations, to make

protestations of his innocence: all his fervor was exercised on that

point: when he mentioned the witnesses, whose perjuries had bereaved him

of life, his expressions were full of mildness and of charity. He solemnly

disavowed all those immoral principles, which over-zealous Protestants had

ascribed without distinction to the church of Rome: and he hoped, he said,

that the time was now approaching, when the present delusion would be

dissipated; and when the force of truth, though late, would engage the

whole world to make reparation to his injured honor.

 

The populace, who had exulted at Stafford’s trial and condemnation, were

now melted into tears, at the sight of that tender fortitude which shone

forth in each feature, and motion, and accent of this aged noble. Their

profound silence was only interrupted by sighs and groans: with difficulty

they found speech to assent to those protestations of innocence which he

frequently repeated: “We believe you, my lord! God bless you, my lord!”

 These expressions with a faltering accent flowed from them. The

executioner himself was touched with sympathy. Twice he lifted up the axe,

with an intent to strike the fatal blow; and as often felt his resolution

to fail him. A deep sigh was heard to accompany his last effort, which

laid Stafford forever at rest. All the spectators seemed to feel the blow.

And when the head was held up to them with the usual cry, “This is the

head of a traitor,” no clamor of assent was uttered. Pity, remorse, and

astonishment had taken possession of every heart, and displayed itself in

every countenance.

 

This is the last blood which was shed on account of the Popish plot; an

incident which, for the credit of the nation, it were better to bury in

eternal oblivion; but which it is necessary to perpetuate, as well to

maintain the truth of history, as to warn, if possible, their posterity

and all mankind never again to fall into so shameful, so barbarous a

delusion.

 

The execution of Stafford gratified the prejudices of the country party;

but it contributed nothing to their power and security: on the contrary,

by exciting commiseration, it tended still further to increase the

disbelief of the whole plot, which began now to prevail. The commons,

therefore, not to lose the present opportunity, resolved to make both

friends and enemies sensible of their power. They passed a bill for easing

the Protestant dissenters, and for repealing the persecuting statute of

the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth: this laudable bill was likewise carried

through the house of peers. The chief justice was very obnoxious for

dismissing the grand jury in an irregular manner, and thereby

disappointing that bold measure of Shaftesbury and his friends, who had

presented the duke as a recusant. For this crime the commons sent up an

impeachment against him; as also against Jones and Weston, two of the

judges, who, in some speeches from the bench, had gone so far as to give

to many of the first reformers the appellation of fanatics.

 

The king, in rejecting the exclusion bill, had sheltered himself securely

behind the authority of the house of peers; and the commons had been

deprived of the usual pretence, to attack the sovereign himself under

color of attacking his ministers and counsellors. In prosecution, however,

of the scheme which he had formed, of throwing the blame on the commons in

case of any rupture, he made them a new speech. After warning them, that a

neglect of this opportunity would never be retrieved, he added these

words: “I did promise you the fullest satisfaction which your hearts could

wish, for the security of the Protestant religion, and to concur with you

in any remedies which might consist with preserving the succession of the

crown in its due and legal course of descent. I do again, with the same

reservations, renew the same promises to you: and being thus ready on my

part to do all that can reasonably be expected from me, I should be glad

to know from you, as soon as may be, how far I shall be assisted by you,

and what it is you desire from me.”

  

The most reasonable objection against the limitations proposed by the

king, is, that they introduced too considerable an innovation in the

government, and almost totally annihilated the power of the future

monarch. But considering the present disposition of the commons and their

leaders, we may fairly presume, that this objection would have small

weight with them, and that their disgust against the court would rather

incline them to diminish than support regal authority. They still hoped,

from the king’s urgent necessities and his usual facility, that he would

throw himself wholly into their hands; and that thus, without waiting for

the accession of the duke, they might immediately render themselves

absolute masters of the government. The commons, therefore, besides

insisting still on the exclusion, proceeded to bring in bills of an

important, and some of them of an alarming nature: one to renew the

triennial act, which had been so inadvertently repealed in the beginning

of the reign; a second to make the office of judge during good behavior; a

third to declare the levying of money without consent of parliament to be

high treason; a fourth to order an association for the safety of his

majesty’s person, for defence of the Protestant religion, for the

preservation of the Protestant subjects against all invasions and

opposition whatsoever, and for preventing the duke of York, or any Papist,

from succeeding to the crown. The memory of the covenant was too recent

for men to overlook the consequences of such an association; and the king,

who was particularly conversant in Davila, could not fail of recollecting

a memorable foreign instance, to fortify this domestic experience.

 

The commons also passed many votes, which, though they had not the

authority of laws, served, however, to discover the temper and disposition

of the house. They voted, that whoever had advised his majesty to refuse

the exclusion bill, were promoters of Popery and enemies to the king and

kingdom. In another vote, they named the marquis of Worcester, the earls

of Clarendon, Feversham, and Halifax, Laurence Hyde, and Edward Seymour,

as those dangerous enemies; and they requested his majesty to remove them

from his person and councils forever. They voted, that, till the exclusion

bill were passed, they could not, consistent with the trust reposed in

them, grant the king any manner of supply. And lest he should be enabled,

by any other expedient, to support the government, and preserve himself

independent, they passed another vote, in which they declared, that

whoever should hereafter lend, by way of advance, any money upon those

branches of the king’s revenue arising from customs, excise, or hearth

money, should be judged a hinderer of the sitting of parliament, and be

responsible for the same in parliament.

 

The king might presume that the peers, who had rejected the exclusion

bill, would still continue to defend the throne, and that none of the

dangerous bills, introduced into the othe*[**missing r] house, would ever

be presented for the royal assent and approbation. But as there remained

no hopes of bringing the commons to any better temper, and as their

further sitting served only to keep faction alive, and to perpetuate the

general ferment of the nation, he came secretly to a resolution of

proroguing them.

 

1681

 

They got intelligence about a quarter of an hour before the black rod came

to their door. Not to lose such precious time, they passed, in a

tumultuous manner, some extraordinary resolutions. They voted, that

whosoever advised his majesty to prorogue this parliament to any other

purpose than in order to pass the bill of exclusion, was a betrayer of the

king, of the Protestant religion, and of the kingdom of England; a

promoter of the French interest, and a pensioner of France: that thanks be

given to the city of London for their manifest loyalty, and for their care

and vigilance in the preservation of the king and of the Protestant

religion: that it is the opinion of this house, that that city was burned

in the year 1666 by the Papists, designing thereby to introduce arbitrary

power and Popery into the kingdom: that humble application be made to his

majesty for restoring the duke of Monmouth to all his offices and

commands, from which, it appears to the house, he had been removed by the

influence of the duke of York: and that it is the opinion of the house,

that the prosecution of the Protestant dissenters upon the penal laws is

at this time grievous to the subject, a weakening of the Protestant

interest, an encouragement of Popery, and dangerous to the peace of the

kingdom.

 

The king passed some laws of no great importance: but the bill for

repealing the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth, he privately ordered the clerk of

the crown not to present to him. By this artifice, which was equally

disobliging to the country party as if the bill had been rejected, and at

the same time implied some timidity in the king, that salutary act was for

the present eluded. The king had often of himself attempted, and sometimes

by irregular means, to give indulgence to nonconformists: but besides that

he had usually expected to comprehend the Catholics in this liberty, the

present refractory disposition of the sectaries had much incensed him

against them; and he was resolved, if possible, to keep them still at

mercy.

 

The last votes of the commons seemed to be an attempt of forming

indirectly an association against the crown, after they found that their

association bill could not pass: the dissenting interest, the city, and

the duke of Monmouth, they endeavored to connect with the country party. A

civil war indeed never appeared so likely as at present; and it was high

time for the king to dissolve a parliament which seemed to have

entertained such dangerous projects. Soon after, he summoned another.

Though he observed, that the country party had established their interest

so strongly in all the electing boroughs, that he could not hope for any

disposition more favorable in the new parliament, this expedient was still

a prosecution of his former project, of trying every method by which he

might form an accommodation with the commons; and if all failed, he hoped

that he could the better justify to his people, at least to his party, a

final breach with them.

 

It had always been much regretted by the royalists, during the civil wars,

that the long parliament had been assembled at Westminster, and had

thereby received force and encouragement from the vicinity of a potent and

factious city, which had zealously embraced their party. Though the king

was now possessed of guards, which in some measure overawed the populace,

he was determined still further to obviate all inconveniences; and he

summoned the new parliament to meet at Oxford. The city of London showed

how just a judgment he had formed of their dispositions. Besides

reelecting the same members, they voted thanks to them for their former

behavior, in endeavoring to discover the depth of the horrid and hellish

Popish plot, and to exclude the duke of York, the principal cause of the

ruin and misery impending over the nation. Monmouth with fifteen peers

presented a petition against assembling the parliament at Oxford, “where

the two houses,” they said, “could not be in safety; but would be easily

exposed to the swords of the Papists and their adherents, of whom too many

had crept into his majesty’s guards.” These insinuations, which pointed so

evidently at the king himself, were not calculated to persuade him, but to

inflame the people.

 

The exclusionists might have concluded, both from the king’s dissolution

of the last parliament, and from his summoning of the present to meet at

Oxford, that he was determined to maintain his declared resolution of

rejecting their favorite bill; but they still flattered themselves, that

his urgent necessities would influence his easy temper, and finally gain

them the ascendant. The leaders came to parliament, attended not only by

their servants, but by numerous bands of their partisans. The four city

members in particular were followed by great multitudes, wearing ribbons,

in which were woven these words, “No Popery! No slavery!” The king had his

guards regularly mustered: his party likewise endeavored to make a show of

their strength; and on the whole, the assembly at Oxford rather bore the

appearance of a tumultuous Polish diet, than of a regular English

parliament.

 

The king, who had hitherto employed the most gracious expressions to all

his parliaments, particularly the two last, thought proper to address

himself to the present in a more authoritative manner. He complained of

the unwarrantable proceedings of the former house of commons; and said,

that, as he would never use arbitrary government himself, neither would he

ever suffer it in others. By calling, however, this parliament so soon, he

had sufficiently shown, that no past irregularities could inspire him with

a prejudice against those assemblies. He now afforded them, he added, yet

another opportunity of providing for the public safety; and to all the

world had given one evidence more, that on his part he had not neglected

the duty incumbent on him.

 

The commons were not overawed by the magisterial air of the king’s speech.

They consisted almost entirely of the same members; they chose the same

speaker; and they instantly fell into the same measures, the impeachment

of Danby, the repeal of the persecuting statute of Elizabeth, the inquiry

into the Popish plot, and the bill of exclusion. So violent were they on

this last article, that no other expedient, however plausible, could so

much as be hearkened to. Ernley, one of the king’s ministers, proposed,

that the duke should be banished, during life, five hundred miles from

England and that on the king’s demise the next heir should be constituted

regent with regal power: yet even this expedient, which left the duke only

the bare title of king, could not, though seconded by Sir Thomas Lyttleton

and Sir Thomas Mompesson, obtain the attention of the house. The past

disappointments of the country party, and the opposition made by the

court, had only rendered them more united, more haughty, and more

determined. No method but their own, of excluding the duke, could give

them any satisfaction.

 

There was one Fitzharris, an Irish Catholic, who had insinuated himself

into the duchess of Portsmouth’s acquaintance, and had been very busy in

conveying to her intelligence of any libel written by the country party,

or of any designs entertained against her or against the court. For

services of this kind, and perhaps too from a regard to his father. Sil

Edward Fitzharris, who had been an eminent royalist, he had received from

the king a present of two hundred and fifty pounds. This man met with one

Everard, a Scotchman, a spy of the exclusionists, and an informer

concerning the Popish plot; and he engaged him to write a libel against

the king, the duke, and the whole administration. What Fitzharris’s

intentions were, cannot well be ascertained: it is probable, as he

afterwards asserted, that he meant to carry this libel to his patron, the

duchess, and to make a merit of the discovery. Everard, who suspected some

other design, and who was well pleased on his side to have the merit of a

discovery with his patrons, resolved to betray his friend: he posted Sir

William Waller, a noted justice of peace, and two persons more, behind the

hangings, and gave them an opportunity of seeing and hearing the whole

transaction. The libel, sketched out by Fitzharris, and executed partly by

him, partly by Everard, was the most furious, indecent, and outrageous

performance imaginable, and such as was fitter to hurt than serve any

party which should be so imprudent as to adopt it. Waller carried the

intelligence to the king, and obtained a warrant for committing

Fitzharris, who happened at that very time to have a copy of the libel in

his pocket. Finding himself now delivered over to the law, he resolved to

pay court to the popular party, who were alone able to protect him, and by

whom he observed almost all trials to be governed and directed. He

affirmed, that he had been employed by the court to write the libel, in

order to throw the odium of it on the exclusionists: but this account,

which was within the bounds of credibility, he disgraced by circumstances

which are altogether absurd and improbable. The intention of the

ministers, he said, was to send about copies to all the heads of the

country party; and the moment they received them, they were to be

arrested, and a conspiracy to be imputed to them. That he might merit

favor by still more important intelligence, he commenced a discoverer of

the great Popish plot; and he failed not to confirm all the tremendous

circumstances, insisted on by his predecessors. He said, that the second

Dutch war was entered into with a view of extirpating the Protestant

religion, both abroad and at home; that Father Parry, a Jesuit, on the

disappointment by the peace, told him, that the Catholics resolved to

murder the king, and had even engaged the queen in that design; that the

envoy of Medena offered him two thousand pounds to kill the king, and upon

his refusal the envoy said, that the duchess of Mazarine, who was as

expert at poisoning as her sister, the Countess of Soissons, would, with a

little phial, execute that design; that upon the king’s death, the army in

Flanders was to come over and massacre the Protestants; that money was

raised in Italy for recruits and supplies, and there should be no more

parliaments; and that the Duke was privy to this whole plan, and had even

entered into the design of Godfrey’s murder, which was executed in the

manner related by France.

 

The popular leaders had all along been very desirous of having an

accusation against the Duke; and though Oates and Bedloe, in their first

evidence, had not dared to go so far, both Dugdale and Dangerfield had

afterwards been encouraged to supply so material a defect, by

comprehending him in the conspiracy. The commons, therefore, finding that

Fitzharris was also willing to serve this purpose, were not ashamed to

adopt his evidence, and resolved for that end, to save him from the

destruction with which he was at present threatened. The king had removed

him from the city prison, where he was exposed to be tampered with by the

exclusionists; had sent him to the Tower; and had ordered him to be

prosecuted by an indictment at common law. In order to prevent his trial

and execution, an impeachment was voted by the commons against him, and

sent up to the lords. That they might show the greater contempt of the

court, they ordered, by way of derision, that the impeachment should be

carried up by Secretary Jenkins; who was so provoked by the intended

affront, that he at first refused obedience; though afterwards, being

threatened with commitment, he was induced to comply. The lords voted to

remit the affair to the ordinary courts of justice, before whom, as the

attorney-general informed them, it was already determined to try

Fitzharris. The commons maintained that the peers were obliged to receive

every impeachment from the commons; and this indeed seems to have been the

first instance of their refusal: they therefore voted, that the lords, in

rejecting their impeachment, had denied justice, and had violated the

constitution of parliament. They also declared, that whatever inferior

court should proceed against Fitzharris, or any one that lay under

impeachment, would be guilty of a high breach of privilege. Great heats

were likely to ensue; and as the king saw no appearance of any better

temper in the commons, he gladly laid hold of the opportunity afforded by

a quarrel between the two houses, and he proceeded to a dissolution of the

parliament. The secret was so well kept, that the commons had no

intimation of it till the black rod came to their door, and summoned them

to attend the king at the house of peers.

 

This vigorous measure, though it might have been foreseen, excited such

astonishment in the country party, as deprived them of all spirit, and

reduced them to absolute despair. They were sensible, though too late,

that the king had finally taken his resolution, and was determined to

endure any extremity rather than submit to those terms which they had

resolved to impose upon him. They found that he had patiently waited till

affairs should come to full maturity; and having now engaged a national

party on his side, had boldly set his enemies at defiance. No parliament,

they knew, would be summoned for some years; and during that long

interval, the court, though perhaps at the head of an inferior party, yet

being possessed of all authority, would have every advantage over a body

dispersed and disunited. These reflections crowded upon every one; and all

the exclusionists were terrified, lest Charles should follow the blow by

some action more violent, and immediately take vengeance on them for their

long and obstinate opposition to his measures. The king on his part was no

less apprehensive, lest despair might prompt them to have recourse to

force, and make some sudden attempt upon his person. Both parties

therefore hurried from Oxford; and in an instant that city, so crowded and

busy, was left in its usual emptiness and tranquillity.

 

The court party gathered force from the dispersion and astonishment of

their antagonists, and adhered more firmly to the king, whose resolutions,

they now saw, could be entirely depended on. The violences of the

exclusionists were every where exclaimed against and aggravated; and even

the reality of the plot, that great engine of their authority, was openly

called in question*[**missing period] The clergy especially were busy in

this great revolution; and being moved, partly by their own fears partly

by the insinuations of the court, they represented all their antagonists

as sectaries and republicans, and rejoiced in escaping those perils which

they believed to have been hanging over them. Principles the most opposite

to civil liberty were every where enforced from the pulpit, and adopted in

numerous addresses; where the king was flattered in his present measures,

and congratulated on his escape from parliaments. Could words have been

depended on, the nation appeared to be running fast into voluntary

servitude, and seemed even ambitious of resigning into the king’s hands

all the privileges transmitted to them, through so many ages, by their

gallant ancestors.

 

But Charles had sagacity enough to distinguish between men’s real internal

sentiments, and the language which zeal and opposition to a contrary

faction may sometimes extort from them. Notwithstanding all these

professions of duty and obedience, he was resolved not to trust, for a

long time, the people with a new election, but to depend entirely on his

own economy for alleviating those necessities under which he labored.

Great retrenchments were made in the household: even his favorite navy was

neglected: Tangiers, though it had cost great sums of money, was a few

years after abandoned and demolished. The mole was entirely destroyed; and

the garrison, being brought over to England, served to augment that small

army which the king relied on as the solid basis of his authority. It had

been happy for the nation, had Charles used his victory with justice and

moderation equal to the prudence and dexterity with which he obtained it.

 

The first step taken by the court was the trial of Fitzharris. Doubts were

raised by the jury with regard to their power of trying him, after the

concluding vote of the commons: but the judges took upon them to decide

the question in the affirmative, and the jury were obliged to proceed. The

writing of the libel was clearly proved upon Fitzharris: the only question

was with regard to his intentions. He asserted, that he was a spy of the

court, and had accordingly carried the libel to the duchess of Portsmouth;

and he was desirous that the jury should, in this transaction, consider

him as a cheat, not as a traitor. He failed, however, somewhat in the

proof; and was brought in guilty of treason by the jury.

 

Finding himself entirely in the hands of the king, he now retracted all

his former impostures with regard to the popish plot, and even endeavored

to atone for them by new impostures against the country party. He

affirmed, that these fictions had been extorted from him by the

suggestions and artifices of Treby, the recorder, and of Bethel and

Cornish, the two sheriffs: this account he persisted in even at his

execution; and though men knew that nothing could be depended on which

came from one so corrupt, and so lost to all sense of honor, yet were they

inclined, from his perseverance, to rely somewhat more on his veracity in

these last asseverations. But it appears that his wife had some

connections with Mrs. Wall, the favorite maid of the duchess of

Portsmouth; and Fitzharris hoped, if he persisted in a story agreeable to

the court, that some favor might, on that account, be shown to his family.

 

It is amusing to reflect on the several lights in which this story has

been represented by the opposite factions. The country party affirmed,

that Fitzharris had been employed by the court, in order to throw the

odium of the libel on the exclusionists, and thereby give rise to a

Protestant plot: the court party maintained, that the exclusionists had

found out Fitzharris, a spy of the ministers, and had set him upon this

undertaking, from an intention of loading the court with the imputation of

such a design upon the exclusionists. Rather than acquit their

antagonists, both sides were willing to adopt an account the most

intricate and incredible. It was a strange situation in which the people

at this time were placed; to be every day tortured with these perplexed

stories, and inflamed with such dark suspicions against their

fellow-citizens. This was no less than the fifteenth false plot, or sham

plot, as they were then called, with which the court, it was imagined, had

endeavored to load their adversaries.[*]

 

The country party had intended to make use of Fitzharris’s evidence

against the duke and the Catholics; and his execution was therefore a

great mortification to them. But the king and his ministers were resolved

not to be contented with so slender an advantage. They were determined to

pursue the victory, and to employ against the exclusionists those very

offensive arms, however unfair, which that party had laid up in store

against their antagonists. The whole gang of spies, witnesses, informers,

suborners, who had so long been supported and encouraged by the leading

patriots, finding now that the king was entirely master, turned short upon

their old patrons and offered their service to the ministers. To the

disgrace of the court and of the age, they were received with hearty

welcome, and their testimony, or rather perjury, made use of in order to

commit legal murder upon the opposite party. With an air of triumph and

derision, it was asked, “Are not these men good witnesses, who have

established the Popish plot, upon whose testimony Stafford and so many

Catholics have been executed, and whom you yourselves have so long

celebrated as men of credit and veracity? You have admitted them into your

bosom: they are best acquainted with your treasons: they are determined in

another shape to serve their king and country: and you cannot complain,

that the same measure which you meted to others, should now, by a

righteous doom or vengeance, be measured out to you.”

  

It is certain that the principle of retaliation may serve in some cases as

a full apology, in others as an alleviation, for a conduct which would

otherwise be exposed to great blame. But these infamous arts, which poison

justice in its very source, and break all the bands of human society, are

so detestable and dangerous, that no pretence of retaliation can be

pleaded as an apology or even an alleviation of the crime incurred by

them. On the contrary, the greater indignation the king and his ministers

felt, when formerly exposed to the perjuries of abandoned men, the more

reluctance should they now have discovered against employing the same

instruments of vengeance upon their antagonists.

 

The first person on whom the ministers fell was one College, a London

joiner, who had become extremely noted for his zeal against Popery, and

was much connected with Shaftesbury and the leaders of the country party:

for as they relied much upon the populace, men of College’s rank and

station were useful to them. College had been in Oxford armed with sword

and pistol during the sitting of the parliament; and this was made the

foundation of his crime. It was pretended that a conspiracy had been

entered into to seize the king’s person, and detain him in confinement,

till he should make the concessions demanded of him. The sheriffs of

London were in strong opposition to the court; and it was not strange,

that the grand jury named by them rejected the bill against College. The

prisoner was therefore sent to Oxford, where the treason was said to have

been committed. Lord Norris, a courtier, was sheriff of the county; and

the inhabitants were in general devoted to the court party. A jury was

named, consisting entirely of royalists; and though they were men of

credit and character, yet such was the factious rage which prevailed, that

little justice could be expected by the prisoner. Some papers, containing

hints and directions for his defence, were taken from him, as he was

conducted to his trial; an iniquity which some pretended to justify by

alleging, that a like violence had been practised against a prisoner

daring the fury of the Popish plot. Such wild notes of retaliation were at

that time propagated by the court party.

 

The witnesses produced against College were Dugdale, Turberville, Haynes,

Smith; men who had before given evidence against the Catholics, and whom

the jury, for that very reason, regarded as the most perjured villains.

College, though beset with so many toils, and oppressed with so many

iniquities, defended himself with spirit, courage, capacity, presence of

mind; and he invalidated the evidence of the crown, by convincing

arguments and undoubted testimony: yet did the jury, after half an hour’s

deliberation, bring in a verdict against him. The inhuman spectators

received the verdict with a shout of applause: but the prisoner was nowise

dismayed. At his execution, he maintained the same manly fortitude, and

still denied the crime imputed to him. His whole conduct and demeanor

prove him to have been a man led astray only by the fury of the times, and

to have been governed by an honest but indiscreet zeal for his country and

his religion.

 

Thus the two parties, actuated by mutual rage, but cooped up within the

narrow limits of the law, levelled with poisoned daggers the most deadly

blows against each other’s breast, and buried in their factious divisions

all regard to truth, honor and humanity.
