The causes of disgust which for above thirty years had daily been

multiplying in England, were now come to full maturity, and threatened the

kingdom with some great revolution or convulsion. The uncertain and

undefined limits of prerogative and privilege had been eagerly disputed

during that whole period; and in every controversy between prince and

people, the question, however doubtful, had always been decided by each

party in favor of its own pretensions. Too lightly, perhaps, moved by the

appearance of necessity, the king had even assumed powers incompatible

with the principles of limited government, and had rendered it impossible

for his most zealous partisans entirely to justify his conduct, except by

topics so unpopular, that they were more fitted, in the present

disposition of men’s minds, to inflame than appease the general

discontent. Those great supports of public authority, law and religion,

had likewise, by the unbounded compliance of judges and prelates, lost

much of their influence over the people; or rather had, in a great

measure, gone over to the side of faction, and authorized the spirit of

opposition and rebellion. The nobility, also, whom the king had no means

of retaining by offices and preferments suitable to their rank, had been

seized with the general discontent, and unwarily threw themselves into the

scale which already began too much to preponderate. Sensible of some

encroachments which had been made by royal authority, men entertained no

jealousy of the commons, whose enterprises for the acquisition of power

had ever been covered with the appearance of public good, and had hitherto

gone no further than some disappointed efforts and endeavors. The progress

of the Scottish malecontents reduced the crown to an entire dependence for

supply: their union with the popular party in England brought great

accession of authority to the latter: the near prospect of success roused

all latent murmurs and pretensions, which had hitherto been held in such

violent constraint; and the torrent of general inclination and opinion ran

so strongly against the court, that the king was in no situation to refuse

any reasonable demands of the popular leaders either for defining or

limiting the powers of his prerogative. Even many exorbitant claims, in

his present situation, would probably be made, and must necessarily be

complied with.

 

The triumph of the malecontents over the church was not yet so immediate

or certain. Though the political and religious Puritans mutually lent

assistance to each other, there were many who joined the former, yet

declined all connection with the latter. The hierarchy had been

established in England ever since the reformation: the Romish church, in

all ages, had carefully maintained that form of ecclesiastical government:

the ancient fathers too bore testimony to episcopal jurisdiction; and

though parity may seem at first to have had place among Christian pastors,

the period during which it prevailed was so short, that few undisputed

traces of it remained in history. The bishops and their more zealous

partisans inferred, thence the divine, indefeasible right of prelacy:

others regarded that institution as venerable and useful; and if the love

of novelty led some to adopt the new rites and discipline of the Puritans,

the reverence to antiquity retained many in their attachment to the

liturgy and government of the church. It behoved, therefore, the zealous

innovators in parliament to proceed with some caution and reserve. By

promoting all measures which reduced the powers of the crown, they hoped

to disarm the king, whom they justly regarded, from principle,

inclination, and policy, to be the determined patron of the hierarchy. By

declaiming against the supposed encroachments and tyranny of the prelates,

they endeavored to carry the nation, from a hatred of their persons, to an

opposition against their office and character. And when men were enlisted

in party, it would not be difficult, they thought, to lead them by degrees

into many measures for which they formerly entertained the greatest

aversion. Though the new sectaries composed not at first the majority of

the nation, they were inflamed, as is usual among innovators, with extreme

zeal for their opinions. Their unsurmountable passion, disguised to

themselves as well as to others under the appearance of holy fervors, was

well qualified to make proselytes, and to seize the minds of the ignorant

multitude. And one furious enthusiast was able, by his active industry, to

surmount the indolent efforts of many sober and reasonable antagonists.

 

When the nation, therefore, was so generally discontented and little

suspicion was entertained of any design to subvert the church and

monarchy, no wonder that almost all elections ran in favor of those who,

by their high pretensions to piety and patriotism, had encouraged the

national prejudices. It is a usual compliment to regard the king’s

inclination in the choice of a speaker; and Charles had intended to

advance Gardiner, recorder of London, to that important trust; but so

little interest did the crown at that time possess in the nation, that

Gardiner was disappointed of his election, not only in London, but in

every other place where it was attempted; and the king was obliged to make

the choice of speaker fail on Lenthal, a lawyer of some character, but not

sufficiently qualified for so high and difficult an office.[*]

 

The eager expectations of men with regard to a parliament, summoned at so

critical a juncture, and during such general discontents; a parliament

which, from the situation of public affairs, could not be abruptly

dissolved, and which was to execute every thing left unfinished by former

parliaments; these motives, so important and interesting, engaged the

attendance of all the members; and the house of commons was never observed

to be from the beginning so full and numerous. Without any interval,

therefore, they entered upon business, and by unanimous consent they

immediately struck a blow which may in a manner be regarded as decisive.

 

The earl of Strafford was considered as chief minister, both on account of

the credit which he possessed with his master, and of his own great and

uncommon vigor and capacity. By a concurrence of accidents, this man

labored under the severe hatred of all the three nations which composed

the British monarchy. The Scots, whose authority now ran extremely high,

looked on him as the capital enemy of their country and one whose counsels

and influence they had most reason to apprehend. He had engaged the

parliament of Ireland to advance large subsidies, in order to support a

war against them: he had levied an army of nine thousand men, with which

he had menaced all their western coast: he had obliged the Scots who lived

under his government, to renounce the Covenant, their national idol: he

had in Ireland proclaimed the Scottish Covenanters rebels and traitors,

even before the king had issued any such declaration against them in

England, and he had ever dissuaded his master against the late treaty and

suspension of arms, which he regarded as dangerous and dishonorable. So

avowed and violent were the Scots in their resentment of all these

measures, that they had refused to send commissioners to treat at York, as

was at first proposed; because, they said, the lieutenant of Ireland,

their capital enemy, being general of the king’s forces, had there the

chief command and authority.

 

Strafford, first as deputy, then as lord lieutenant, had governed Ireland

during eight years with great vigilance, activity, and prudence, but with

very little popularity. In a nation so averse to the English government

and religion, these very virtues were sufficient to draw on him the public

hatred. The manners too and character of this great man, though to all

full of courtesy, and to his friends full of affection, were at bottom

haughty, rigid, and severe. His authority and influence during the time of

his government had been unlimited; but no sooner did adversity seize him,

than the concealed aversion of the nation blazed up at once, and the Irish

parliament used every expedient to aggravate the charge against him.

 

The universal discontent which prevailed in England against the court, was

all pointed towards the earl of Strafford; though without any particular

reason, but because he was the minister of state whom the king most

favored and most trusted. His extraction was honorable, his paternal

fortune considerable, yet envy attended his sudden and great elevation.

And his former associates in popular counsels, finding that he owed his

advancement to the desertion of their cause, represented him as the great

apostate of the commonwealth, whom it behoved them to sacrifice as a

victim to public justice.

 

Strafford, sensible of the load of popular prejudices under which he

labored, would gladly have declined attendance in parliament; and he

begged the king’s permission to withdraw himself to his government of

Ireland, at least to remain at the head of the army in Yorkshire; where

many opportunities, he hoped, would offer, by reason of his distance, to

elude the attacks of his enemies. But Charles, who had entire confidence

in the earl’s capacity, thought that his counsels would be extremely

useful during the critical session which approached. And when Strafford

still insisted on the danger of his appearing amidst so many enraged

enemies, the king, little apprehensive that his own authority was so

suddenly to expire, promised him protection, and assured him that not a

hair of his head should be touched by the parliament.[*]

 

No sooner was Strafford’s arrival known, than a concerted attack was made

upon him in the house of commons. Pym, in a long studied discourse,

divided into many heads, after his manner, enumerated all the grievances

under which the nation labored; and, from a complication of such

oppressions, inferred that a deliberate plan had been formed of changing

entirely the frame of government, and subverting the ancient laws and

liberties of the kingdom.[**] Could any thing, he said, increase our

indignation against so enormous and criminal a project, it would be to

find that, during the reign of the best of princes, the constitution had

been endangered by the worst of ministers, and that the virtues of the

king had been seduced by wicked and pernicious counsel. We must inquire,

added he, from what fountain these waters of bitterness flow; and though

doubtless many evil counsellors will be found to have contributed their

endeavors, yet there is one who challenges the infamous preeminence, and

who, by his courage, enterprise, and capacity, is entitled to the first

place among these betrayers of their country. He is the earl of Strafford,

lieutenant of Ireland, and president of the council of York, who, in both

places, and in all other provinces where he has been intrusted with

authority, has raised ample monuments of tyranny, and will appear, from a

survey of his actions, to be the chief promoter of every arbitrary

counsel. Some instances of imperious expressions, as well as actions, were

given by Pym; who afterwards entered into a more personal attack of that

minister, and endeavored to expose his whole character and manners. The

austere genius of Strafford, occupied in the pursuits of ambition, had not

rendered his breast altogether inaccessible to the tender passions, or

secured him from the dominion of the fair; and in that sullen age, when

the irregularities of pleasure were more reproachful than the most odious

crimes, these weaknesses were thought worthy of being mentioned, together

with his treasons, before so great an assembly. And, upon the whole, the

orator concluded, that it belonged to the house to provide a remedy

proportionable to the disease, and to prevent the further mischiefs justly

to be apprehended from the influence which this man had acquired over the

measures and counsels of their sovereign.[***]

 

Sir John Clotworthy, an Irish gentleman, Sir John Hotham of Yorkshire, and

many others, entered into the same topics, and after several hours spent

in bitter invective, when the doors were locked, in order to prevent all

discovery of their purpose, it was moved, in consequence of the resolution

secretly taken, that Strafford should immediately be impeached of high

treason. This motion was received with universal approbation; nor was

there, in all the debate, one person who offered to stop the torrent by

any testimony in favor of the earls conduct. Lord Falkland alone, though

known to be his enemy, modestly desired the house to consider whether it

would not better suit the gravity of their proceedings, first to digest by

a committee many of those particulars which had been mentioned, before

they sent up an accusation against him. It was ingeniously answered by

Pym, that such a delay might probably blast all their hopes, and put it

out of their power to proceed any further in the prosecution: that when

Strafford should learn that so many of his enormities were discovered, his

conscience would dictate his condemnation; and so great was his power and

credit, he would immediately procure the dissolution of the parliament, or

attempt some other desperate measure for his own preservation: that the

commons were only accusers, not judges; and it was the province of the

peers to determine whether such a complication of enormous crimes in one

person, did not amount to the highest crime known by the law.[*] Without

further debate, the impeachment was voted: Pym was chosen to carry it up

to the lords: most of the house accompanied him on so agreeable an errand;

and Strafford, who had just entered the house of peers, and who little

expected so speedy a prosecution was immediately, upon this general

charge, ordered into custody, with several symptoms of violent prejudice

in his judges as well as in his prosecutors.

 

In the inquiry concerning grievances, and in the censure of past measures,

Laud could not long escape the severe scrutiny of the commons; who were

led too, in their accusation of that prelate, as well by their prejudices

against his whole order, as by the extreme antipathy which his intemperate

zeal had drawn upon him. After a deliberation which scarcely lasted half

an hour, an impeachment of high treason was voted against this subject,

the first both in rank and in favor throughout the kingdom. Though this

incident, considering the example of Stratford’s impeachment, and the

present disposition of the nation and parliament, needed be no surprise to

him, yet was he betrayed into some passion when the accusation was

presented. “The commons themselves,” he said, “though his accusers, did

not believe him guilty of the crimes with which they charged him;” an

indiscretion which, next day, upon more mature deliberation, he desired

leave to retract; but so little favorable were the peers, that they

refused him this advantage or indulgence. Laud also was immediately, upon

this general charge, sequestered from parliament, and committed to

custody.[*]

 

The capital article insisted on against these two great men, was the

design which the commons supposed to have been formed of subverting the

laws and constitution of England, and introducing arbitrary and unlimited

authority into the kingdom. Of all the king’s ministers, no one was so

obnoxious in this respect as the lord keeper Finch. He it was who, being

speaker in the king’s third parliament, had left the chair, and refused to

put the question when ordered by the house. The extrajudicial opinion of

the judges in the case of ship money had been procured by his intrigues,

persuasions, and even menaces. In all unpopular and illegal measures, he

was ever most active; and he was even believed to have declared publicly,

that, while he was keeper, an order of council should always with him be

equivalent to a law. To appease the rising displeasure of the commons, he

desired to be heard at their bar. He prostrated himself with all humility

before them; but this submission availed him nothing. An impeachment was

resolved on; and in order to escape their fury, he thought proper secretly

to withdraw, and retire into Holland. As he was not esteemed equal to

Stratford, or even to Laud, either in capacity or in fidelity to his

master, it was generally believed that his escape had been connived at by

the popular leaders.[**] His impeachment, however, in his absence, was

carried up to the house of peers.

 

Sir Francis Windebank, the secretary, was a creature of Laud’s; a

sufficient reason for his being extremely obnoxious to the commons. He was

secretly suspected too of the crime of Popery; and it was known that, from

complaisance to the queen, and indeed in compliance with the king’s maxims

of government, he had granted many indulgences to Catholics, and had

signed warrants for the pardon of priests, and their delivery from

confinement. Grimstone, a popular member, called him, in the house, the

very pander and broker to the whore of Babylon.[*] Finding that the

scrutiny of the commons was pointing towards him, and being sensible that

England was no longer a place of safety for men of his character, he

suddenly made his escape into France.[**]

 

Thus in a few weeks this house of commons, not opposed, or rather seconded

by the peers, had produced such a revolution in the government, that the

two most powerful and most favored ministers of the king were thrown into

the Tower, and daily expected to be tried for their life: two other

ministers had, by flight alone, saved themselves from a like fate: all the

king’s servants saw that no protection could be given them by their

master: a new jurisdiction was erected in the nation; and before that

tribunal all those trembled who had before exulted most in their credit

and authority.

 

What rendered the power of the commons more formidable was, the extreme

prudence with which it was conducted. Not content with the authority which

they had acquired by attacking these great ministers, they were resolved

to render the most considerable bodies of the nation obnoxious to them.

Though the idol of the people, they determined to fortify themselves

likewise with terrors, and to overawe those who might still be inclined to

support the falling ruins of monarchy.

 

During the late military operations, several powers had been exercised by

the lieutenants and deputy lieutenants of counties; and these powers,

though necessary for the defence of the nation, and even warranted by all

former precedent yet not being authorized by statute, were now voted to be

illegal, and the persons who had assumed them declared delinquents. This

term was newly come into vogue, and expressed a degree and species of

guilt not exactly known or ascertained. In consequence of that

determination, many of the nobility and prime gentry of the nation, while

only exerting as they justly thought, the legal powers of magistracy

unexpectedly found themselves involved in the crime of delinquency. And

the commons reaped this multiplied advantage by their vote: they disarmed

the crown; they established the maxims of rigid law and liberty; and they

spread the terror of their own authority.[*]

 

The writs for ship money had been directed to the sheriffs, who were

required, and even obliged, under severe penalties, to assess the sums

upon individuals, and to levy them by their authority: yet were all the

sheriffs, and all those who had been employed in that illegal service,

voted, by a very rigorous sentence, to be delinquents. The king, by the

maxims of law, could do no wrong: his ministers and servants, of whatever

degree, in case cf any violation of the constitution, were alone

culpable.[**]

 

All the farmers and officers of the customs, who had been employed during

so many years in levying tonnage and poundage and the new impositions,

were likewise declared criminals, and were afterwards glad to compound for

a pardon by paying a fine of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds.

 

Every discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star chamber and high

commission, courts which, from their very constitution, were arbitrary,

underwent a severe scrutiny; and all those who had concurred in such

sentences were voted to be liable to the penalties of law.[***] No

minister of the king, no member of the council, but found himself exposed

by this decision.

 

The judges who had given their vote against Hambden in the trial of ship

money, were accused before the peers, and obliged to find surety for their

appearance. Berkeley, a judge of the king’s bench, was seized by order of

the house, even when sitting in his tribunal; and all men saw with

astonishment the irresistible authority of their jurisdiction.[****]

 

The sanction of the lords and commons, as well as that of the king, was

declared necessary for the confirmation of ecclesiastical canons.[v] And

this judgment, it must be confessed, however reasonable, at least useful,

it would have been difficult to justify by any precedent.[v*]

 

But the present was no time for question or dispute. That decision which

abolished all legislative power except that of parliament, was requisite

for completing the new plan of liberty, and rendering it quite uniform and

systematical. Almost all the bench of bishops, and the most considerable

of the inferior clergy, who had voted in the late convocation, found

themselves exposed by these new principles to the imputation of

delinquency.[*]

 

The most unpopular of all Charles’s measures, and the least justifiable,

was the revival of monopolies, so solemnly abolished, after reiterated

endeavors, by a recent act of parliament. Sensible of this unhappy

measure, the king had of himself recalled, during the time of his first

expedition against Scotland, many of these oppressive patents; and the

rest were now annulled by authority of parliament, and every one who was

concerned in them declared delinquents. The commons carried so far their

detestation of this odious measure, that they assumed a power which had

formerly been seldom practised,[**] and they expelled all their members

who were monopolists or projectors; an artifice by which, besides

increasing their own privileges, they weakened still further the very

small party which the king secretly retained in the house. Mildmay, a

notorious monopolist, yet having associated himself with the ruling party,

was still allowed to keep his seat. In all questions, indeed, of

elections, no steady rule of decision was observed; and nothing further

was regarded than the affections and attachments of the parties.[***]

Men’s passions were too much heated to be shocked with any instance of

injustice, which served ends so popular as those which were pursued by

this house of commons.

 

The whole sovereign power being thus in a manner transferred to the

commons, and the government, without any seeming violence or disorder,

being changed in a moment from a monarchy almost absolute to a pure

democracy, the popular leaders seemed willing for some time to suspend

their active vigor, and to consolidate their authority, ere they proceeded

to any violent exercise of it. Every day produced some new harangue on

past grievances. The detestation of former usurpations was further

enlivened; the jealousy of liberty roused; and, agreeably to the spirit of

free government, no less indignation was excited by the view of a violated

constitution, than by the ravages of the most enormous tyranny.

 

This was the time when genius and capacity of all kinds, freed from the

restraint of authority, and nourished by unbounded hopes and projects,

began to exert themselves, and be distinguished by the public. Then was

celebrated the sagacity of Pym, more fitted for use than ornament;

matured, not chilled, by his advanced age and long experience: then was

displayed the mighty ambition of Hambden, taught disguise, not moderation,

from former constraint; supported by courage, conducted by prudence,

embellished by modesty; but whether founded in a love of power or zeal for

liberty, is still, from his untimely end, left doubtful and uncertain:

then too were known the dark, ardent, and dangerous character of St. John;

the impetuous spirit of Hollis, violent and sincere, open and entire in

his enmities and in his friendships; the enthusiastic genius of young

Vane, extravagant in the ends which he pursued, sagacious and profound in

the means which he employed; incited by the appearances of religion,

negligent of the duties of morality.

 

So little apology would be received for past measures, so contagious the

general spirit of discontent, that even men of the most moderate tempers,

and the most attached to the church and monarchy, exerted themselves with

the utmost vigor in the redress of grievances, and in prosecuting the

authors of them. The lively and animated Digby displayed his eloquence on

this occasion; the firm and undaunted Capel, the modest and candid Palmer.

In this list too of patriot royalists are found the virtuous names of Hyde

and Falkland. Though in their ultimate views and intentions these men

differed widely from the former, in their present actions and discourses

an entire concurrence and unanimity was observed.

 

By the daily harangues and invectives against illegal usurpations, not

only the house of commons inflamed themselves with the highest animosity

against the court: the nation caught new fire from the popular leaders,

and seemed now to have made the first discovery of the many supposed

disorders in the government. While the law in several instances seemed to

be violated, they went no further than some secret and calm murmurs; but

mounted up into rage and fury as soon as the constitution was thought to

be restored to its former integrity and vigor. The capital especially,

being the seat of parliament, was highly animated with the spirit of

mutiny and disaffection. Tumults were daily raised; seditious assemblies

encouraged; and every man, neglecting his own business, was wholly intent

on the defence of liberty and religion. By stronger contagion, the popular

affections were communicated from breast to breast in this place of

general rendezvous and society.

 

The harangues of members, now first published and dispersed, kept alive

the discontents against the king’s administration. The pulpits, delivered

over to Puritanical preachers and lecturers, whom the commons arbitrarily

settled in all the considerable churches, resounded with faction and

fanaticism. Vengeance was fully taken for the long silence and constraint

in which, by the authority of Laud and the high commission, these

preachers had been retained. The press, freed from all fear or reserve,

swarmed with productions, dangerous by their seditious zeal and calumny,

more than by any art or eloquence of composition. Noise and fury, cant and

hypocrisy, formed the sole rhetoric which, during this tumult of various

prejudices and passions, could be heard or attended to.

 

The sentence which had been executed against Prynne, Bastwic, and Burton,

now suffered a revisal from parliament. These libellers, far from being

tamed by the rigorous punishments which they had undergone, showed still a

disposition of repeating their offence; and the ministers were afraid lest

new satires should issue from their prisons, and still further inflame the

prevailing discontents. By an order, therefore, of council, they had been

carried to remote prisons; Bastwic to Scilly, Prynne to Jersey, Burton to

Guernsey; all access to them was denied; and the use of books, and of pen,

ink and paper, was refused them. The sentence for these additional

punishments was immediately reversed, in an arbitrary manner, by the

commons: even the first sentence, upon examination, was declared illegal;

and the judges who passed it were ordered to make reparation to the

sufferers.[*]

 

When the prisoners landed in England, they were received and entertained

with the highest demonstrations of affection; were attended by a mighty

confluence of company, their charges were borne with great magnificence,

and liberal presents bestowed on them. On their approach to any town, all

the inhabitants crowded to receive them, and welcomed their reception with

shouts and acclamations. Their train still increased as they drew nigh to

London. Some miles from the city, the zealots of their party met them in

great multitudes, and attended their triumphant entrance: boughs were

carried in this tumultuous procession; the roads were strewed with

flowers; and amidst the highest exultations of joy, were intermingled loud

and virulent invectives against the prelates, who had so cruelly

persecuted such godly personages.[*] The more ignoble these men were, the

more sensible was the insult upon royal authority, and the more dangerous

was the spirit of disaffection and mutiny which it discovered among the

people.

 

Lilburne, Leighton, and every one that had been punished for seditious

libels during the preceding administration, now recovered their liberty,

and were decreed damages from the judges and ministers of justice.[**]

 

Not only the present disposition of the nation insured impunity to all

libellers: a new method of framing and dispersing libels was invented by

the leaders of popular discontent. Petitions to parliament were drawn,

craving redress against particular grievances; and when a sufficient

number of subscriptions was procured, the petitions were presented to the

commons, and immediately published. These petitions became secret bonds of

association among the subscribers, and seemed to give undoubted sanction

and authority to the complaints which they contained.

 

It is pretended by historians favorable to the royal cause,[***] and is

even asserted by the king himself in a declaration,[****] that a most

disingenuous, or rather criminal, practice prevailed in conducting many of

these addresses. A petition was first framed; moderate, reasonable, such

as men of character willingly subscribed. The names were afterwards torn

off and affixed to another petition which served better the purposes of

the popular faction. We may judge of the wild fury which prevailed

throughout the nation, when so scandalous an imposture, which affected

such numbers of people, could be openly practised without drawing infamy

and ruin upon the managers.

 

So many grievances were offered, both by the members and by petitions

without doors, that the house was divided into above forty committees,

charged each of them with the examination of some particular violation of

law and liberty which had been complained of. Besides the general

committees of religion, trade, privileges, laws, many subdivisions of

these were framed, and a strict scrutiny was every where carried on. It is

to be remarked that, before the beginning of this century, when the

commons assumed less influence and authority, complaints of grievances

were usually presented to the house by any members who had had particular

opportunity of observing them. These general committees, which were a kind

of inquisitorial courts, had not then been established; and we find that

the king, in a former declaration.[*] complains loudly of this innovation,

so little favorable to royal authority. But never was so much multiplied,

as at present, the use of these committees; and the commons, though

themselves the greatest innovators, employed the usual artifice of

complaining against innovations, and pretending to recover the ancient and

established government.

 

From the reports of their committees, the house daily passed votes which

mortified and astonished the court, and inflamed and animated the nation.

Ship money was declared illegal and arbitrary; the sentence against

Hambden cancelled; the court of York abolished; compositions for

knighthood stigmatized; the enlargement of the forests condemned; patents

for monopolies annulled; and every late measure of administration treated

with reproach and obloquy. To-day a sentence of the star chamber was

exclaimed against; to-morrow a decree of the high commission. Every

discretionary act of council was represented as arbitrary and tyrannical;

and the general inference was still inculcated, that a formed design had

been laid to subvert the laws and constitution of the kingdom.

 

From necessity the king remained entirely passive during all these violent

operations. The few servants who continued faithful to him, were seized

with astonishment at the rapid progress made by the commons in power and

popularity, and were glad, by their inactive and inoffensive behavior, to

compound for impunity. The torrent rising to so dreadful and unexpected a

height, despair seized all those who from interest or habit were most

attached to monarchy. And as for those who maintained their duty to the

king merely from their regard to the constitution, they seemed by their

concurrence to swell that inundation which began already to deluge every

thing. “You have taken the whole machine of government in pieces,” said

Charles, in a discourse to the parliament; “a practice frequent with

skilful artists, when they desire to clear the wheels from any rust which

may have grown upon them. The engine,” continued he, “may again be

restored to its former use and motions, provided it be put up entire, so

as not a pin of it be wanting.” But this was far from the intention of the

commons. The machine, they thought, with some reason, was encumbered with

many wheels and springs which retarded and crossed its operations, and

destroyed its utility. Happy! had they proceeded with moderation, and been

contented, in their present plenitude of power, to remove such parts only

as might justly be deemed superfluous and incongruous.

 

In order to maintain that high authority which they had acquired, the

commons, besides confounding and overawing their opponents, judged it

requisite to inspire courage into their friends and adherents;

particularly into the Scots, and the religious Puritans, to whose

assistance and good offices they were already so much beholden.

 

No sooner were the Scots masters of the northern counties, than they laid

aside their first professions, which they had not indeed means to support,

of paying for every thing; and in order to prevent the destructive

expedient of plunder and free quarters, the country consented to give them

a regular contribution of eight hundred and fifty pounds a day, in full of

their subsistence.[*]

 

The parliament, that they might relieve the northern counties from so

grievous a burden, agreed to remit pay to the Scottish as well as to the

English army; and because subsidies would be levied too slowly for so

urgent an occasion, money was borrowed from the citizens upon the security

of particular members. Two subsidies, a very small sum,[*] were at first

voted; and as the intention of this supply was to indemnify the members

who by their private had supported public credit, this pretence was

immediately laid hold of, and the money was ordered to be paid, not into

the treasury, but to commissioners appointed by parliament; a practice

which as it diminished the authority of the crown, was willingly embraced,

and was afterwards continued by the commons with regard to every branch of

revenue which they granted to the king. The invasion of the Scots had

evidently been the cause of assembling the parliament: the presence of

their army reduced the king to that total subjection in which he was now

held: the commons, for this reason, openly professed their intention of

retaining these invaders, till all their own enemies should be suppressed,

and all their purposes effected. “We cannot yet spare the Scots,” said

Strode plainly in the house, “the sons of Zeruiah are still too strong for

us;”[**] an allusion to a passage of Scripture, according to the mode of

that age. Eighty thousand pounds a month were requisite for the

subsistence of the two armies; a sum much greater than the subject had

ever been accustomed in any former period to pay to the public. And though

several subsidies, together with a poll-tax, were from time to time voted

to answer the charge, the commons still took care to be in debt, in order

to render the continuance of the session the more necessary.

 

The Scots being such useful allies to the malecontent party in England, no

wonder they were courted with the most unlimited complaisance and the most

important services. The king, having in his first speech called them

rebels, observed that he had given great offence to the parliament; and he

was immediately obliged to soften, and even retract the expression.

 

The Scottish commissioners, of whom the most considerable were the earl of

Rothes and Lord Loudon, found every advantage in conducting their treaty;

yet made no haste in bringing it to an issue. They were lodged in the

city, and kept an intimate correspondence, as well with the magistrates

who were extremely disaffected, as with the popular leaders in both

houses. St. Antholine’s church was assigned them for their devotions; and

their chaplains here began openly to practise the Presbyterian form of

worship, which, except in foreign languages, had never hitherto been

allowed any indulgence or toleration. So violent was the general

propensity towards this new religion, that multitudes of all ranks crowded

to the church. Those who were so happy as to find access early in the

morning, kept their places the whole day, those who were excluded clung to

the doors or windows, in hopes of catching at least some distant murmur or

broken phrases of the holy rhetoric.[*] All the eloquence of parliament,

now well refined from pedantry, animated with the spirit of liberty and

employed in the most important interests, was not attended to with such

insatiable avidity, as were these lectures, delivered with ridiculous cant

and a provincial accent, full of barbarism and of ignorance.

 

The most effectual expedient for paying court to the zealous Scots, was to

promote the Presbyterian discipline and worship throughout England; and to

this innovation the popular leaders among the commons, as well as their

more devoted partisans, were of themselves sufficiently inclined. The

Puritanical party, whose progress, though secret, had hitherto been

gradual in the kingdom, taking advantage of the present disorders, began

openly to profess their tenets, and to make furious attacks on the

established religion. The prevalence of that sect in the parliament

discovered itself, from the beginning, by insensible but decisive

symptoms. Marshall and Burgess, two Puritanical clergymen, were chosen to

preach before them, and entertained them with discourses seven hours in

length.[**] It being the custom of the house always to take the sacrament

before they enter upon business, they ordered, as a necessary preliminary,

that the communion table should be removed from the east end of St.

Margaret’s into the middle of the area.[***] The name of the “spiritual

lords” was commonly left out in acts of parliament; and the laws ran in

the name of king, lords, and commons. The clerk of the upper house, in

reading bills, turned his back on the bench of bishops; nor was his

insolence ever taken notice of.

 

On a day appointed for a solemn fast and humiliation, all the orders of

temporal peers, contrary to former practice, in going to church took place

of the spiritual; and Lord Spencer remarked that the humiliation that day

seemed confined alone to the prelates.

 

Every meeting of the commons produced some vehement harangue against the

usurpations of the bishops, against the high commission, against the late

convocation, against the new canons. So disgusted were all lovers of civil

liberty at the doctrines promoted by the clergy, that these invectives

were received without control; and no distinction at first appeared

between such as desired only to repress the exorbitancies of the

hierarchy, and such as pretended totally to annihilate episcopal

jurisdiction. Encouraged by these favorable appearances, petitions against

the church were framed in different parts of the kingdom. The epithet of

the ignorant and vicious priesthood was commonly applied to all churchmen

addicted to the established discipline and worship; though the episcopal

clergy in England, during that age, seem to have been, as they are at

present, sufficiently learned and exemplary. An address against episcopacy

was presented by twelve clergymen to the committee of religion, and

pretended to be signed by many hundreds of the Puritanical persuasion. But

what made most noise was, the city petition for a total alteration of

church government; a petition to which fifteen thousand subscriptions were

annexed, and which was presented by Alderman Pennington, the city

member.[*] It is remarkable that, among the many ecclesiastical abuses

there complained of, an allowance given by the licensers of books to

publish a translation of Ovid’s Art of Love, is not forgotten by these

rustic censors.[**]

 

Notwithstanding the favorable disposition of the people, the leaders in

the house resolved to proceed with caution. They introduced a bill for

prohibiting all clergymen the exercise of any civil office. As a

consequence, the bishops were to be deprived of their seats in the house

of peers; a measure not unacceptable to the zealous friends of liberty,

who observed with regret the devoted attachment of that order to the will

of the monarch. But when this bill was presented to the peers, it was

rejected by a great majority;[***] the first check which the commons had

received in their popular career, and a prognostic of what they might

afterwards expect from the upper house, whose inclinations and interests

could never be totally separated from the throne.

 

But to show how little they were discouraged, the Puritans immediately

brought in another bill for the total abolition of episcopacy; though they

thought proper to let that bill sleep at present, in expectation of a more

favorable opportunity of reviving it.[*]

 

Among other acts of regal executive power which the commons were every day

assuming, they issued orders for demolishing all images, altars,

crucifixes. The zealous Sir Robert Harley, to whom the execution of these

orders was committed, removed all crosses even out of streets and markets;

and, from his abhorrence of that superstitious figure, would not any where

allow one piece of wood or stone to lie over another at right angles.[**]

 

The bishop of Ely and other clergymen were attacked on account of

innovations.[***] Cozens, who had long been obnoxious, was exposed to new

censures. This clergyman, who was dean of Peterborough, was extremely

zealous for ecclesiastical ceremonies: and so far from permitting the

communicants to break the sacramental bread with their fingers, a

privilege on which the Puritans strenuously insisted, he would not so much

as allow it to be cut with an ordinary household instrument. A consecrated

knife must perform that sacred office, and must never afterwards be

profaned by any vulgar service.[****]

 

Cozens likewise was accused of having said, “The king has no more

authority in ecclesiastical matters, than the boy who rubs my horse’s

heels.”[v] The expression was violent: but it is certain that all those

high churchmen, who were so industrious in reducing the laity to

submission, were extremely fond of their own privileges and independency,

and were desirous of exempting the mitre from all subjection to the crown.

 

A committee was elected by the lower house as a court of inquisition upon

the clergy, and was commonly denominated the committee of “scandalous

ministers.” The politicians among the commons were apprised of the great

importance of the pulpit for guiding the people; the bigots were enraged

against the prelatical clergy; and both of them knew that no established

government could be overthrown by strictly observing the principles of

justice, equity, or clemency. The proceedings, therefore, of this famous

committee, which continued for several years, were cruel and arbitrary,

and made great havoc both on the church and the universities. They began

with harassing, imprisoning, and molesting the clergy; and ended with

sequestrating and ejecting them. In order to join contumely to cruelty,

they gave the sufferers the epithet of “scandalous,” and endeavored to

render them as odious as they were miserable.[*] The greatest vices,

however, which they could reproach to a great part of them, were, bowing

at the name of Jesus, placing the communion table in the east, reading the

king’s orders for sports on Sunday, and other practices which the

established government, both in church and state, had strictly enjoined

them.

 

It may be worth observing, that all historians who lived near that age,

or, what perhaps is more decisive, all authors who have casually made

mention of those public transactions, still represent the civil disorders

and convulsions as proceeding from religious controversy, and consider the

political disputes about power and liberty as entirely subordinate to the

other. It is true, had the king been able to support government, and at

the same time to abstain from all invasion of national privileges, it

seems not probable that the Puritans ever could have acquired such

authority as to overturn the whole constitution: yet so entire was the

subjection into which Charles was now fallen, that, had not the wound been

poisoned by the infusion of theological hatred, it must have admitted of

an easy remedy. Disuse of parliaments, imprisonments and prosecution of

members, ship money, an arbitrary administration; these were loudly

complained of; but the grievances which tended chiefly to inflame the

parliament and nation, especially the latter, were the surplice, the rails

placed about the altar, the bows exacted on approaching it, the liturgy,

the breach of the Sabbath, embroidered copes, lawn sleeves, the use of the

ring in marriage, and of the cross in baptism. On account of these were

the popular leaders content to throw the government into such violent

convulsions; and, to the disgrace of that age and of this island, it must

be acknowledged, that the disorders in Scotland entirely, and those in

England mostly proceeded from so mean and contemptible an origin.[**]

 

Some persons, partial to the patriots of this age, have ventured to put

them in a balance with the most illustrious characters of antiquity; and

mentioned the names of Pym, Hambden, Vane, as a just parallel to those of

Cato, Brutus, Cassius. Profound capacity, indeed, undaunted courage,

extensive enterprise; in these particulars, perhaps, the Roman do not much

surpass the English worthies: but what a difference, when the discourse,

conduct, conversation, and private as well as public behavior of both are

inspected! Compare only one circumstance, and consider its consequences.

The leisure of those noble ancients was totally employed in the study of

Grecian eloquence and philosophy; in the cultivation of polite letters and

civilized society: the whole discourse and language of the moderns were

polluted with mysterious jargon, and full of the lowest and most vulgar

hypocrisy.

 

The laws, as they stood at present, protected the church but they exposed

the Catholics to the utmost rage of the Puritans; and these unhappy

religionists, so obnoxious to the prevailing sect, could not hope to

remain long unmolested. The voluntary contribution, which they had made,

in order to assist the king in his war against the Scottish Covenanters,

was inquired into, and represented as the greatest enormity.[*] By an

address from the commons, all officers of that religion were removed from

the army, and application was made to the king for seizing two thirds of

the lands of recusants; a proportion to which by law he was entitled, but

which he had always allowed them to possess upon easy compositions. The

execution of the severe and bloody laws against priests was insisted on;

and one Goodman, a Jesuit, who was found in prison, was condemned to a

capital punishment. Charles, however, agreeably to his usual principles,

scrupled to sign the warrant for his execution; and the commons expressed

great resentment on the occasion.[**] There remains a singular petition of

Goodman, begging to be hanged, rather than prove a source of contention

between the king and his people.[***]

 

He escaped with his life; but it seems more probable, that he was

overlooked amidst affairs of greater consequence, than that such

unrelenting hatred would be softened by any consideration of his courage

and generosity.

 

For some years Con, a Scotchman, afterwards Rosetti, an Italian, had

openly resided at London, and frequented the court, as vested with a

commission from the pope. The queen’s zeal, and her authority with her

husband, had been the cause of this imprudence, so offensive to the

nation.[*] But the spirit of bigotry now rose too high to permit any

longer such indulgences.[**]

 

Hayward, a justice of peace, having been wounded, when employed in the

exercise of his office, by one James, a Catholic madman, this enormity was

ascribed to the Popery, not to the frenzy of the assassin; and great

alarms seized the nation and parliament.[***] A universal conspiracy of

the Papists was supposed to have taken place; and every man for some days

imagined that he had a sword at his throat. Though some persons of family

and distinction were still attached to the Catholic superstition, it is

certain that the numbers of that sect did not amount to the fortieth part

of the nation: and the frequent panics to which men, during this period,

were so subject on account of the Catholics, were less the effects of

fear, than of extreme rage and aversion entertained against them.

 

The queen mother of France, having been forced into banishment by some

court intrigues, had retired into England; and expected shelter, amidst

her present distresses, in the dominions of her daughter and son-in-law,

But though she behaved in the most inoffensive manner, she was insulted by

the populace on account of her religion, and was even threatened with

worse treatment. The earl of Holland, lieutenant of Middlesex, had ordered

a hundred musketeers to guard her; but finding that they had imbibed the

same prejudices with the rest of their countrymen, and were unwillingly

employed in such a service, he laid the case before the house of peers,

for the king’s authority was now entirely annihilated. He represented the

indignity of the action, that so great a princess, mother to the king of

France and to the queens of Spain and England, should be affronted by the

multitude. He observed the indelible reproach which would fall upon the

nation, if that unfortunate queen should suffer any violence from the

misguided zeal of the people. He urged the sacred rights of hospitality,

due to every one, much more to a person in distress, of so high a rank,

with whom the nation was so nearly connected. The peers thought proper to

communicate the matter to the commons, whose authority over the people was

absolute. The commons agreed to the necessity of protecting the queen

mother; but at the same time prayed that she might be desired to depart

the kingdom, “for the quieting those jealousies in the hearts of his

majesty’s well-affected subjects, occasioned by some ill instruments about

that queen’s person, by the flowing of priests and Papists to her house,

and by the use and practice of the idolatry of the mass, and exercise of

other superstitious services of the Romish church, to the great scandal of

true religion.”[*]

 

Charles, in the former part of his reign, had endeavored to overcome the

intractable and encroaching spirit of the commons, by a perseverance in

his own measures, by a stately dignity of behavior, and by maintaining at

their utmost height, and even perhaps stretching beyond former precedent,

the rights of his prerogative. Finding, by experience, how unsuccessful

those measures had proved, and observing the low condition to which he was

now reduced, he resolved to alter his whole conduct, and to regain the

confidence of his people by pliableness, by concessions, and by a total

conformity to their inclinations and prejudices. It may safely be averred,

that this new extreme into which the king, for want of proper counsel or

support, was fallen, became no less dangerous to the constitution, and

pernicious to public peace, than the other, in which he had so long and so

unfortunately persevered.

 

The pretensions with regard to tonnage and poundage were revived, and with

certain assurance of success, by the commons.[**]

 

The levying of these duties as formerly, without consent of parliament,

and even increasing them at pleasure, was such an incongruity in a free

constitution, where the people by their fundamental privileges cannot be

taxed but by their own consent, as could no longer be endured by these

jealous patrons of liberty. In the preamble, therefore, to the bill by

which the commons granted these duties to the king, they took care, in the

strongest and most positive terms, to assert their own right of bestowing

this gift, and to divest the crown of all independent title of assuming

it. And that they might increase, or rather finally fix, the entire

dependence and subjection of the king, they voted these duties only for

two months; and afterwards, from time to time, renewed their grant for

very short periods.[*] Charles, in order to show that he entertained no

intention ever again to separate himself from his parliament, passed this

important bill without any scruple or hesitation.[**]

 

With regard to the bill for triennial parliaments, he made a little

difficulty. By an old statute, passed during the reign of Edward III., it

had been enacted, that parliaments should be held once every year, or more

frequently if necessary: but as no provision had been made in case of

failure, and no precise method pointed out for execution, this statute had

been considered merely as a general declaration, and was dispensed with at

pleasure. The defect was supplied by those vigilant patriots who now

assumed the reins of government. It was enacted, that if the chancellor,

who was first bound under severe penalties, failed to issue writs by the

third of September in every third year, any twelve or more of the peers

should be empowered to exert this authority; in default of the peers, that

the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, etc., should summon the voters; and in

their default, that the voters themselves should meet and proceed to the

election of members, in the same manner as if writs had been regularly

issued from the crown. Nor could the parliament, after it was assembled,

be adjourned, prorogued, or dissolved, without their own consent, during

the space of fifty days. By this bill, some of the noblest and most

valuable prerogatives of the crown were retrenched; but at the same time

nothing could be more necessary than such a statute, for completing a

regular plan of law and liberty. A great reluctance to assemble

parliaments must be expected in the king, where these assemblies, as of

late, establish it as a maxim to carry their scrutiny into every part of

government. During long intermissions of parliament, grievances and

abuses, as was found by recent experience, would naturally creep in; and

it would even become necessary for the king and council to exert a great

discretionary authority, and by acts of state to supply, in every

emergence, the legislative power, whose meeting was so uncertain and

precarious. Charles, finding that nothing less would satisfy his

parliament and people, at last gave his assent to this bill which produced

so great an innovation in the constitution.[*] Solemn thanks were

presented him by both houses. Great rejoicings were expressed both in the

city and throughout the nation. And mighty professions were every where

made of gratitude and mutual returns of supply and confidence. This

concession of the king, it must be owned, was not entirely voluntary: it

was of a nature too important to be voluntary. The sole inference which

his partisans were entitled to draw from the submissions so frankly made

to present necessity was, that he had certainly adopted a new plan of

government, and for the future was resolved, by every indulgence, to

acquire the confidence and affections of his people.

 

Charles thought, that what concessions were made to the public were of

little consequence, if no gratifications were bestowed on individuals who

had acquired the direction of public counsels and determinations. A change

of ministers, as well as of measures, was therefore resolved on. In one

day, several new privy counsellors were sworn; the earls of Hertford

Bedford, Essex, Bristol; the lords Say, Saville, Kimbolton. within a few

days after was admitted the earl of Warwick.[**] All these noblemen were

of the popular party; and some of them afterwards, when matters were

pushed to extremities by the commons, proved the greatest support of

monarchy.

 

Juxon, bishop of London, who had never desired the treasurer’s staff, now

earnestly solicited for leave to resign it, and retire to the care of that

turbulent diocese committed to him. The king gave his consent; and it is

remarkable that, during all the severe inquiries carried on against the

conduct of ministers and prelates, the mild and prudent virtues of this

man who bore both these invidious characters, remained unmolested.[*] It

was intended that Bedford, a popular man, of great authority, as well as

wisdom and moderation, should succeed Juxon; but that nobleman,

unfortunately both for king and people, died about this very time. By some

promotions, place was made for St. John, who was created

solicitor-general. Hollis was to be made secretary of state, in the room

of Windebank, who had fled: Pym, chancellor of the exchequer, in the room

of Lord Cottington, who had resigned: Lord Say, master of the wards, in

the room of the same nobleman: the earl of Essex, governor, and Hambden,

tutor to the prince.[**]

 

What retarded the execution of these projected changes, was the difficulty

of satisfying all those who, from their activity and authority in

parliament, had pretensions for offices, and who still had it in their

power to embarrass and distress the public measures. Their associates too

in popularity, whom the king intended to distinguish by his favor, were

unwilling to undergo the reproach of having driven a separate bargain, and

of sacrificing to their own ambitious views the cause of the nation. And

as they were sensible that they must owe their preferment entirely to

their weight and consideration in parliament, they were most of them

resolved still to adhere to that assembly, and both to promote its

authority, and to preserve their own credit in it. On all occasions, they

had no other advice to give the king, than to allow himself to be directed

by his great council; or, in other words, to resign himself passively to

their guidance and government. And Charles found, that instead of

acquiring friends by the honors and offices which he should bestow, he

should only arm his enemies with more power to hurt him.

 

The end on which the king was most intent in changing ministers was, to

save the life of the earl of Strafford, and to mollify, by these

indulgences, the rage of his most furious prosecutors. But so high was

that nobleman’s reputation for experience and capacity, that all the new

counsellors and intended ministers plainly saw, that if he escaped their

vengeance, he must return into favor and authority; and they regarded his

death as the only security which they could have, both for the

establishment of their present power, and for success in their future

enterprises. His impeachment, therefore, was pushed on with the utmost

vigor; and, after long and solemn preparations, was brought to a final

issue.

 

Immediately after Strafford was sequestered from parliament, and confined

in the Tower, a committee of thirteen was chosen by the lower house, and

intrusted with the office of preparing a charge against him. These, joined

to a small committee of lords, were vested with authority to examine all

witnesses, to call for every paper, and to use any means of scrutiny, with

regard to any part of the earl’s behavior and conduct.[*] After so general

and unbounded an inquisition, exercised by such powerful and implacable

enemies, a man must have been very cautious or very innocent, not to

afford, during the whole course of his life, some matter of accusation

against him.

 

This committee, by direction from both houses, took an oath of secrecy; a

practice very unusual, and which gave them the appearance of conspirators,

more than ministers of justice.[**] But the intention of this strictness

was, to render it more difficult for the earl to elude their search, or

prepare for his justification.

 

Application was made to the king, that he would allow this committee to

examine privy counsellors with regard to opinions delivered at the board:

a concession which Charles unwarily made, and which thenceforth banished

all mutual confidence from the deliberations of council; where every man

is supposed to have entire freedom, without fear of future punishment or

inquiry, of proposing any expedient, questioning any opinion, or

supporting any argument.[***]

 

Sir George Ratcliffe, the earl’s intimate friend and confidant, was

accused of high treason, sent for from Ireland, and committed to close

custody. As no charge ever appeared or was prosecuted against him, it is

impossible to give a more charitable interpretation to this measure, than

that the commons thereby intended to deprive Strafford, in his present

distress, of the assistance of his best friend, who was most enabled, by

his testimony, to justify the innocence of his patron’s conduct and

behavior.[****]

 

When intelligence arrived in Ireland of the plans laid for Stafford’s

ruin, the Irish house of commons, though they had very lately bestowed

ample praises on his administration, entered into all the violent counsels

against him, and prepared a representation of the miserable state into

which, by his misconduct, they supposed the kingdom to be fallen. They

sent over a committee to London, to assist in the prosecution of their

unfortunate governor; and by intimations from this committee, who entered

into close confederacy with the popular leaders in England, was every

measure of the Irish parliament governed and directed. Impeachments, which

were never prosecuted, were carried up against Sir Richard Bolton, the

chancellor, Sir Gerard Louther, chief justice, and Bramhall, bishop of

Derry.[*] This step, which was an exact counterpart to the proceedings in

England, served also the same purposes: it deprived the king of the

ministers whom he most trusted; it discouraged and terrified all the other

ministers and it prevented those persons who were best acquainted with

Strafford’s counsels from giving evidence in his favor before the English

parliament.

 

1641.

 

The bishops, being forbidden by the ancient canons to assist in trials for

life, and being unwilling by any opposition to irritate the commons, who

were already much prejudiced against them, thought proper of themselves to

withdraw.[**] The commons also voted, that the new-created peers ought to

have no voice in this trial; because the accusation being agreed to while

they were commoners, their consent to it was implied with that of all the

commons of England. Notwithstanding this decision, which was meant only to

deprive Strafford of so many friends, Lord Seymour and some others still

continued to keep their seat; nor was their right to it any further

questioned.[***]

 

To bestow the greater solemnity on this important trial scaffolds were

erected in Westminster Hall; where both houses sat, the one as accusers,

the other as judges. Besides the chair of state, a close gallery was

prepared for the king and queen, who attended during the whole

trial.[****]

 

An accusation carried on by the united effort of three kingdoms against

one man, unprotected by power, unassisted by counsel, discountenanced by

authority, was likely to prove a very unequal contest; yet such were the

capacity, genius presence of mind, displayed by this magnanimous

statesman, that, while argument, and reason, and law had any place, he

obtained an undisputed victory. And *he perished at last, overwhelmed, and

still unsubdued, by the open violence of his fierce and unrelenting

antagonists.

 

The articles of impeachment against Strafford are twenty-eight in number;

and regard his conduct, as president of the council of York, as deputy or

lieutenant of Ireland, and as counsellor or commander in England. But

though four months were employed by the managers in framing the

accusation, and all Strafford’s answers were extemporary, it appears from

comparison, not only that he was free from the crime of treason, of which

there is not the least appearance, but that his conduct, making allowance

for human infirmities, exposed to such severe scrutiny, was innocent, and

even laudable.

 

The powers of the northern council, while he was president, had been

extended by the king’s instructions beyond what formerly had been

practised: but that court being at first instituted by a stretch of royal

prerogative, it had been usual for the prince to vary his instructions;

and the largest authority committed to it was altogether as legal as the

most moderate and most limited. Nor was it reasonable to conclude, that

Strafford had used any art to procure those extensive powers; since he

never once sat as president, or exercised one act of jurisdiction, after

he was invested with the authority so much complained of.[*]

 

In the government of Ireland, his administration had been equally

promotive of his master’s interest, and that of the subjects committed to

his care. A large debt he had paid off: he had left a considerable sum in

the exchequer: the revenue, which never before answered the charges of

government, was now raised to be equal to them.[**] A small standing army,

formerly kept in no order, was augmented, and was governed by exact

discipline; and a great force was there raised and paid for the support of

the king’s authority against the Scottish covenanters.

 

Industry and all the arts of peace were introduced among that rude people;

the shipping of the kingdom augmented a hundred fold;[*] the customs

tripled upon the same rates: the exports double in value to the imports;

manufactures, particularly that of linen, introduced and promoted;[**]

agriculture, by means of the English and Scottish plantations, gradually

advancing; the Protestant religion encouraged, without the persecution or

discontent of the Catholics.

 

The springs of authority he had enforced without overstraining them.

Discretionary acts of jurisdiction, indeed, he had often exerted, by

holding courts martial, billetting soldiers, deciding causes upon paper

petitions before the council, issuing proclamations, and punishing their

infraction. But discretionary authority during that age was usually

exercised even in England. In Ireland, it was still more requisite, among

a rude people, not yet thoroughly subdued, averse to the religion and

manners of their conquerors, ready on all occasions to relapse into

rebellion and disorder. While the managers of the commons demanded every

moment, that the deputy’s conduct should be examined by the line of rigid

law and severe principles, he appealed still to the practice of all former

deputies, and to the uncontrollable necessity of his situation.

 

So great was his art of managing elections and balancing parties, that he

had engaged the Irish parliament to vote whatever was necessary, both for

the payment of former debts, and for support of the new-levied army; nor

had he ever been reduced to the illegal expedients practised in England

for the supply of public necessities. No imputation of rapacity could

justly lie against his administration. Some instances of imperious

expressions, and even actions, may be met with. The case of Lord

Mountnorris, of all those which were collected with so much industry, is

the most flagrant and the least excusable.

 

It had been reported at the table of Lord Chancellor Loftus, that

Annesley, one of the deputy’s attendants, in moving a stool, had sorely

hurt his master’s foot, who was at that time afflicted with the gout.

“Perhaps,” said Mountnorris, who was present at table, “it was done in

revenge of that public affront which my lord deputy formerly put upon him:

but he has a brother who would not have taken such a revenge.” This

casual, and seemingly innocent, at least ambiguous expression, was

reported to Stafford; who, on pretence that such a suggestion might prompt

Annesley to avenge himself in another manner, ordered Mountnorris, who was

an officer to be tried by a court martial for mutiny and sedition against

his general. The court, which consisted of the chief officers of the army,

found the crime to be capital, and condemned that nobleman to lose his

head.[*]

 

In vain did Strafford plead in his own defence against this article of

impeachment, that the sentence of Mountnorris was the deed, and that too

unanimous, of the court, not the act of the deputy; that he spake not to a

member of the court, nor voted in the cause, but sat uncovered as a party,

and then immediately withdrew, to leave them to their freedom; that,

sensible of the iniquity of the sentence, he procured his majesty’s free

pardon to Mountnorris; and that he did not even keep that nobleman a

moment in suspense with regard to his fate, but instantly told him, that

he himself would sooner lose his right hand than execute such a sentence,

nor was his lordship’s life in any danger. In vain did Strafford’s friends

add, as a further apology, that Mountnorris was a man of an infamous

character, who paid court by the lowest adulation to all deputies while

present, and blackened their character by the vilest calumnies when

recalled; and that Strafford, expecting like treatment, had used this

expedient for no other purpose than to subdue the petulant spirit of the

man. These excuses alleviate the guilt; but there still remains enough to

prove, that the mind of the deputy, though great and firm, had been not a

little debauched by the riot of absolute power and uncontrolled authority.

 

When Strafford was called over to England, he found every thing falling

into such confusion, by the open rebellion of the Scots, and the secret

discontents of the English, that, if he had counselled or executed any

violent measure, he might perhaps have been able to apologize for his

conduct from the great law of necessity, which admits not, while the

necessity is extreme, of any scruple, ceremony, or delay.[**] But, in

fact, no illegal advice or action was proved against him; and the whole

amount of his guilt, during this period, was some peevish, or at most

imperious expressions, which, amidst such desperate extremities, and

during a bad state of health, had unhappily fallen from him.

 

If Strafford’s apology was in the main so satisfactory when he pleaded to

each particular article of the charge, his victory was still more decisive

when he brought the whole together, and repelled the imputation of

treason; the crime which the commons would infer from the full view of his

conduct and behavior. Of all species of guilt, the law of England had with

the most scrupulous exactness defined that of treason; because on that

side it was found most necessary to protect the subject against the

violence of the king and of his ministers. In the famous statute of Edward

III., all the kinds of treason are enumerated; and every other crime,

besides such as are there expressly mentioned, is carefully excluded from

that appellation. But with regard to this guilt, “an endeavor to subvert

the fundamental laws,” the statute of treasons is totally silent: and

arbitrarily to introduce it into the fatal catalogue, is itself a

subversion of all law; and under color of defending liberty, reverses a

statute the best calculated for the security of liberty that had ever been

enacted by an English parliament.

 

As this species of treason, discovered by the commons, is entirely new and

unknown to the laws, so is the species of proof by which they pretend to

fix that guilt upon the prisoner. They have invented a kind of

accumulative or constructive evidence, by which many actions either

totally innocent in themselves, or criminal in a much inferior degree,

shall, when united, amount to treason, and subject the person to the

highest penalties inflicted by the law. A hasty and unguarded word, a rash

and passionate action, assisted by the malevolent fancy of the accuser,

and tortured by doubtful constructions, is transmuted into the deepest

guilt; and the lives and fortunes of the whole nation, no longer protected

by justice, are subjected to arbitrary will and pleasure.

 

“Where has this species of guilt lain so long concealed?” said Strafford

in conclusion. “Where has this fire been so long buried during so many

centuries, that no smoke should appear till it burst out at once to

consume me and my children? Better it were to live under no law at all,

and by the maxims of cautious prudence to conform ourselves the best we

can to the arbitrary will of a master, than fancy we have a law on which

we can rely, and find at last, that this law shall inflict a punishment

precedent to the promulgation, and try us by maxims unheard of till the

very moment of the prosecution. If I sail on the Thames, and split my

vessel on an anchor, in case there be no buoy to give warning, the party

shall pay me damages: but if the anchor be marked out, then is the

striking on it at my own peril. Where is the mark set upon this crime?

where the token by which I should discover it? It has lain concealed under

water; and no human prudence, no human innocence, could save me from the

destruction with which I am at present threatened.

 

“It is now full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined;

and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this

crime before myself. We have lived, my lords, happily to ourselves at

home: we have lived gloriously abroad to the world: let us be content with

what our fathers have left us.*let not our ambition carry us to be more

learned than they were in these killing and destructive arts. Great wisdom

it will be in your lordships, and just providence for yourselves, for your

posterities, for the whole kingdom, to cast from you into the fire these

bloody and mysterious volumes of arbitrary and constructive treasons, as

the primitive Christians did their books of curious arts, and betake

yourselves to the plain letter of the statute, which tells you where the

crime is, and points out to you the path by which you may avoid it.

 

“Let us not, to our own destruction, awake those sleeping lions, by

rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by

the wall, forgotten and neglected. To all my afflictions, add not this, my

lords, the most severe of any; that I, for my other sins, not for my

treasons, be the means of introducing a precedent so pernicious to the

laws and liberties of my native country.

 

“However, these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth,

and they believe so; yet, under favor, it is I who, in this particular,

speak for the commonwealth. Precedents like those which are endeavored to

be established against me, must draw along such inconveniencies and

miseries, that in a few years the kingdom will be in the condition

expressed in a statute of Henry IV.; and no man shall know by what rule to

govern his words and actions.

 

“Impose not, my lords, difficulties insurmountable upon ministers of

state, nor disable them from serving with cheerfulness their king and

country. If you examine them, and under such severe penalties, by every

grain, by every little weight, the scrutiny will be intolerable. The

public affairs of the kingdom must be left waste; and no wise man, who has

any honor or fortune to lose, will ever engage himself in such dreadful,

such unknown perils.

 

“My lords, I have now troubled your lordships a great deal longer than I

should have done. Were it not for the interest of these pledges, which a

saint in heaven left me, I should be loath—” (Here he pointed to his

children, and his weeping stopped him.) “What I forfeit for myself, it is

nothing: but, I confess, that my indiscretion should forfeit for them, it

wounds me very deeply. You will be pleased to pardon my infirmity:

something I should have said; but I see I shall not be able, and therefore

I shall leave it.

 

“And now, my lords, I thank God, I have been by his blessing sufficiently

instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments, compared to

the importance of our eternal duration. And so, my lords, even so, with

all humility, and with all tranquillity of mind, I submit, clearly and

freely, to your judgments: and whether that righteous doom shall be to

life or death, I shall repose myself, full of gratitude and confidence, in

the arms of the great Author of my existence.”[*]

 

“Certainly,” says Whitlocke,[**] with his usual candor, “never any man

acted such a part, on such a theatre, with more wisdom, constancy, and

eloquence, with greater reason, judgment, and temper, and with a better

grace in all his words and actions, than did this great and excellent

person; and he moved the hearts of all his auditors, some few excepted, to

remorse and pity.” It is remarkable, that the historian who expresses

himself in these terms, was himself chairman of that committee which

conducted the impeachment against this unfortunate statesman. The

accusation and defence lasted eighteen days. The managers divided the

several articles among them, and attacked the prisoner with all the weight

of authority, with all the vehemence of rhetoric, with all the accuracy of

long preparation. Strafford was obliged to speak with deference and

reserve towards his most inveterate enemies, the commons, the Scottish

nation, and the Irish parliament. He took only a very short time on each

article to recollect himself: yet he alone, without assistance, mixing

modesty and humility with firmness and vigor, made such a defence that the

commons saw it impossible, by a legal prosecution, ever to obtain a

sentence against him.

 

But the death of Stafford was too important a stroke of party to be left

unattempted by any expedient, however extraordinary. Besides the great

genius and authority of that minister, he had threatened some of the

popular leaders with an impeachment; and, had he not himself been suddenly

prevented by the impeachment of the commons, he had that very day, it was

thought, charged Pym, Hambden, and others with treason, for having invited

the Scots to invade England. A bill of attainder was therefore brought

into the lower house immediately after finishing these pleadings; and,

preparatory to it, a new proof of the earl’s guilt was produced, in order

to remove such scruples as might be entertained with regard to a method of

proceeding so unusual and irregular.

 

Sir Henry Vane, secretary, had taken some notes of a debate in council,

after the dissolution of the last parliament; and being at a distance, he

had sent the keys of his cabinet, as was pretended, to his son Sir Henry,

in order to search for some papers which were necessary for completing a

marriage settlement. Young Vane, falling upon this paper of notes, deemed

the matter of the utmost importance; and immediately communicated it to

Pym, who now produced the paper before the house of commons. The question

before the council was, “Offensive or defensive war with the Scots.” The

king proposes this difficulty, “But how can I undertake offensive war, if

I have no more money?” The answer ascribed to Strafford was in these

words: “Borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds: go on vigorously to

levy ship money. Your majesty having tried the affections of your people,

you are absolved and loose from all rules of government, and may do what

power will admit. Your majesty, having tried all ways, shall be acquitted

before God and man. And you have an army in Ireland, which you may employ

to reduce this kingdom to obedience: for I am confident the Scots cannot

hold out five months.” There followed some counsels of Laud and

Cottington, equally violent with regard to the king’s being absolved from

all rules of government.[*]

 

This paper, with all the circumstances of its discovery and communication,

was pretended to be equivalent to two witnesses, and to be an unanswerable

proof of those pernicious counsels of Strafford which tended to the

subversion of the laws and constitution. It was replied by Strafford and

his friends, that old Vane was his most inveterate and declared enemy; and

if the secretary himself, as was by far most probable, had willingly

delivered to his son this paper of notes, to be communicated to Pym, this

implied such a breach of oaths and of trust as rendered him totally

unworthy of all credit: that the secretary’s deposition was at first

exceedingly dubious: upon two examinations, he could not remember any such

words: even the third time, his testimony was not positive, but imported

only, that Strafford had spoken such or suchlike words; and words may be

very like in sound, and differ much in sense; nor ought the lives of men

to depend upon grammatical criticisms of any expressions, much less of

those which had been delivered by the speaker without premeditation, and

committed by the hearer for any time however short, to the uncertain

record of memory: that, in the present case, changing this kingdom into

that kingdom a very slight alteration, the earl’s discourse could regard

nothing but Scotland, and implies no advice unworthy of an English

counsellor: that even retaining the expression, this kingdom, the words

may fairly be understood of Scotland, which alone was the kingdom that the

debate regarded, and which alone had thrown off allegiance, and could be

reduced to obedience: that it could be proved, as well by the evidence of

all the king’s ministers, as by the known disposition of the forces, that

the intention never was to land the Irish army in England, but in

Scotland: that of six other counsellors present, Laud and Windebank could

give no evidence; Northumberland, Hamilton, Cottington, and Juxon, could

recollect no such expression; and the advice was too remarkable to be

easily forgotten: that it was nowise probable such a desperate counsel

would be openly delivered at the board, and before Northumberland, a

person of that high rank, and whose attachments to the court were so much

weaker than his connections with the country. That though Northumberland,

and he alone, had recollected some such expression as that of “being

absolved from rules of government,” yet, in such desperate extremities as

those into which the king and kingdom were then fallen, a maxim of that

nature, allowing it to be delivered by Strafford, may be defended upon

principles the most favorable to law and liberty and that nothing could be

more iniquitous than to extract an accusation of treason from an opinion

simply proposed at the council table; where all freedom of debate ought to

be permitted, and where it was not unusual for the members, in order to

draw forth the sentiments of others, to propose counsels very remote from

their own secret advice and judgment.[*]

 

The evidence of Secretary Vane, though exposed to such unsurmountable

objections, was the real cause of Strafford’ unhappy fate; and made the

bill of attainder pass the commons with no greater opposition than that of

fifty-nine dissenting votes. But there remained two other branches of the

legislature, the king and the lords, whose assent was requisite; and

these, if left to their free judgment, it was easily foreseen, would

reject the bill without scruple or deliberation. To overcome this

difficulty, the popular leaders employed expedients for which they were

beholden partly to their own industry, partly to the indiscretion of their

adversaries.

 

Next Sunday, after the bill passed the commons, the Puritanical pulpits

resounded with declamations concerning the necessity of executing justice

upon great delinquents.[**] The populace took the alarm. About six

thousand men, armed with swords and cudgels, flocked from the city, and

surrounded the houses of parliament.[***] The names of the fifty-nine

commoners who had voted against the bill of attainder, were posted up

under the title of “Straffordians, and betrayers of their country.” These

were exposed to all the insults of the ungovernable multitude. When any of

the lords passed, the cry for justice against Strafford resounded in their

ears; and such as were suspected of friendship to that obnoxious minister,

were sure to meet with menaces, not unaccompanied with symptoms of the

most desperate resolutions in the furious populace.[****]

 

Complaints in the house of commons being made against these violences, as

the most flagrant breach of privilege, the ruling members, by their

affected coolness and indifference, showed plainly, that the popular

tumults were not disagreeable to them.[v] But a new discovery, made about

this time, served to throw every thing into still greater flame and

combustion.

 

Some principal officers, Piercy, Jermyn, O’Neale, Goring, Wilmot, Pollard,

Ashburnham, partly attached to the court, partly disgusted with the

parliament, had formed a plan of engaging into the king’s service the

English army, whom they observed to be displeased at some marks of

preference given by the commons to the Scots. For this purpose, they

entered into an association, took an oath of secrecy, and kept a close

correspondence with some of the king’s servants. The form of a petition to

the king and parliament was concerted; and it was intended to get this

petition subscribed by the army. The petitioners there represent the great

and unexampled concessions made by the king for the security of public

peace and liberty; the endless demands of certain insatiable and turbulent

spirits, whom nothing less will content than a total subversion of the

ancient constitution; the frequent tumults which these factious

malecontents had excited, and which endangered the liberty of parliament.

To prevent these mischiefs, the army offered to come up and guard that

assembly, “So shall the nation,” as they express themselves in the

conclusion, “not only be vindicated from preceding innovations, but be

secured from the future, which are threatened, and which are likely to

produce more dangerous effects than the former.”[*] The draught of this

petition being conveyed to the king, he was prevailed on, somewhat

imprudently, to countersign it himself, as a mark of his approbation. But

as several difficulties occurred, the project was laid aside two months

before any public discovery was made of it.

 

It was Goring who betrayed the secret to the popular leaders. The alarm

may easily be imagined which this intelligence conveyed. Petitions from

the military to the civil power are always looked on as disguised or

rather undisguised commands, and are of a nature widely different from

petitions presented by any other rank of men. Pym opened the matter in the

house.[**] On the first intimation of a discovery, Piercy concealed

himself, and Jermyn withdrew beyond sea. This further confirmed the

suspicion of a dangerous conspiracy. Goring delivered his evidence before

the house: Piercy wrote a letter to his brother, Northumberland,

confessing most of the particulars.[***] Both their testimonies agree with

regard to the oath of secrecy; and as this circumstance had been denied by

Pollard, Ashburnham, and Wilmot, in all their examinations, it was

regarded as a new proof of some desperate resolutions which had been

taken.

 

To convey more quickly the terror and indignation at this plot, the

commons voted that a protestation should be signed by all the members. It

was sent up to the lords, and signed by all of them, except Southampton

and Robarts. Orders were given by the commons alone, without other

authority that it should be subscribed by the whole nation. The

protestation was in itself very inoffensive, even insignificant; and

contained nothing but general declarations, that the subscribers would

defend their religion and liberties.[*] But it tended to increase the

popular panic, and intimated, what was more expressly declared in the

preamble, that these blessings were now exposed to the utmost peril.

 

Alarms were every day given of new conspiracies.[**] In Lancashire, great

multitudes of Papists were assembling: secret meetings were held by them

in caves and under ground in Surrey: they had entered into a plot to blow

up the river with gunpowder, in order to drown the city:[***] provisions

of arms were making beyond sea: sometimes France, sometimes Denmark, was

forming designs against the kingdom; and the populace, who are always

terrified with present, and enraged with distant dangers, were still

further animated in their demands of justice against the unfortunate

Strafford.

 

The king came to the house of lords: and though he expressed his

resolution, for which he offered them any security, never again to employ

Strafford in any branch of public business, he professed himself totally

dissatisfied with regard to the circumstance of treason, and on that

account declared his difficulty in giving his assent to the bill of

attainder.[****] The commons took fire, and voted it a breach of privilege

for the king to take notice of any bill depending before the houses,

Charles did not perceive that his attachment to Strafford was the chief

motive for the bill; and that the greater proofs he gave of anxious

concern for this minister, the more inevitable did he render his

destruction.

 

About eighty peers had constantly attended Strafford’s trial; but such

apprehensions were entertained on account of the popular tumults, that

only forty-five were present when the bill of attainder was brought into

the house. Yet of these nineteen had the courage to vote against it;[v] a

certain proof that if entire freedom had been allowed, the bill had been

rejected by a great majority.

 

In carrying up the bill to the lords, St. John, the solicitor-general,

advanced two topics well suited to the fury of the times; that though the

testimony against Strafford were not clear, yet, in this way of bill,

private satisfaction to each man’s conscience was sufficient, even should

no evidence at all be produced; and that the earl had no title to plead

law, because he had broken the law. It is true, added he, we give law to

hares and deer, for they are beasts of chase: but it was never accounted

either cruel or unfair to destroy foxes or wolves wherever they can be

found, for they are beasts of prey.[*]

 

After popular violence had prevailed over the lords, the same battery was

next applied to force the king’s assent. The populace flocked about

Whitehall, and accompanied their demand of justice with the loudest

clamors and most open menaces. Rumors of conspiracies against the

parliament were anew spread abroad; invasions and insurrections talked of;

and the whole nation was raised into such a ferment, as threatened some

great and imminent convulsion. On whichever side the king cast his eyes,

he saw no resource or security. All his servants, consulting their own

safety, rather than their master’s honor, declined interposing with their

advice between him and his parliament. The queen, terrified with the

appearance of so mighty a danger, and bearing formerly no good will to

Strafford, was in tears, and pressed him to satisfy his people in this

demand, which, it was hoped, would finally content them. Juxon, alone,

whose courage was not inferior to his other virtues, ventured to advise

him, if in his conscience he did not approve of the bill, by no means to

assent to it.[**]

 

Strafford, hearing of Charles’s irresolution and anxiety, took a very

extraordinary step: he wrote a letter, in which he entreated the king, for

the sake of public peace, to put an end to his unfortunate, however

innocent life, and to quiet the tumultuous people by granting them the

request for which they were so importunate.[***]

 

“In this,” added he, “my consent will more acquit you to God than all the

world can do besides. To a willing man there is no injury. And as, by

God’s grace, I forgive all the world, with a calmness and meekness of

infinite contentment to my dislodging soul, so, sir, to you I can resign

the life of this world with all imaginable cheerfulness, in the just

acknowledgment of your exceeding favors.” Perhaps Strafford hoped, that

this unusual instance of generosity would engage the king still more

strenuously to protect him: perhaps he gave his life for lost; and finding

himself in the hands of his enemies, and observing that Balfour, the

lieutenant of the Tower, was devoted to the popular party,[*] he

absolutely despaired of ever escaping the multiplied dangers with which he

was every way environed. We might ascribe this step to a noble effort of

disinterestedness, not unworthy the great mind of Strafford, if the

measure which he advised had not been, in the event, as pernicious to his

master, as it was immediately fatal to himself.[**] 6
 

After the most violent anxiety and doubt, Charles at last granted a

commission to four noblemen to give the royal assent in his name to the

bill; flattering himself probably, in this extremity of distress, that as

neither his will consented to the deed, nor was his hand immediately

engaged in it, he was the more free from all the guilt which attended it.

These commissioners he empowered, at the same time, to give his assent to

the bill which rendered the parliament perpetual.

 

The commons, from policy rather than necessity, had embraced the expedient

of paying the two armies by borrowing money from the city; and these loans

they had repaid afterwards by taxes levied upon the people. The citizens,

either of themselves or by suggestion, began to start difficulties with

regard to a further loan, which was demanded. We make no scruple of

trusting the parliament, said they, were we certain that the parliament

were to continue till our repayment. But in the present precarious

situation of affairs, what security can be given us for our money? In

pretence of obviating this objection, a bill was suddenly brought into the

house, and passed with great unanimity and rapidity, that the parliament

should not be dissolved, prorogued, or adjourned, without their own

consent. It was hurried in like manner through the house of peers, and was

instantly carried to the king for his assent. Charles, in the agony of

grief, shame, and remorse for Strafford’s doom, perceived not that this

other bill was of still more fatal consequence to his authority, and

rendered the power of his enemies perpetual, as it was already

uncontrollable.[*] In comparison of the bill of attainder, by which he

deemed himself an accomplice in his friend’s murder, this concession made

no figure in his eyes;[**] 7 a circumstance which, if it lessen our idea of

his resolution or penetration serves to prove the integrity of his heart,

and the goodness of his disposition. It is indeed certain, that strong

compunction for his consent to Strafford’s execution attended this

unfortunate prince during the remainder of his life; and even at his own

fatal end, the memory of this guilt, with great sorrow and remorse,

recurred upon him. All men were so sensible of the extreme violence which

was done him, that he suffered the less, both in character and interest,

from this unhappy measure; and though he abandoned his best friend, yet

was he still able to preserve, in some degree, the attachment of all his

adherents.

 

Secretary Carleton was sent by the king to inform Strafford of the final

resolution which necessity had extorted from him. The earl seemed

surprised, and starting up, exclaimed, in the words of Scripture, “Put not

your trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, for in them there is no

salvation.”[***] He was soon able, however, to collect his courage; and he

prepared himself to suffer the fatal sentence. Only three days’ interval

was allowed him. The king, who made a new effort in his behalf, and sent

by the hands of the young prince a letter addressed to the peers, in which

he entreated them to confer with the commons about a mitigation of

Strafford’s sentence, and begged at least for some delay, was refused in

both requests.[****]

 

Strafford, in passing from his apartment to Tower Hill, where the scaffold

was erected, stopped under Laud’s windows, with whom he had long lived in

intimate friendship, and entreated the assistance of his prayers in those

awful moments which were approaching. The aged primate dissolved in tears;

and having pronounced, with a broken voice, a tender blessing on his

departing friend, sunk into the arms of his attendants.[v] Stafford, still

superior to his fate, moved on with an elated countenance, and with an air

even of greater dignity than what usually attended him.

 

He wanted that consolation which commonly supports those who perish by the

stroke of injustice and oppression: he was not buoyed up by glory, nor by

the affectionate compassion of the spectators; yet his mind, erect and

undaunted, found resources within itself, and maintained its unbroken

resolution amidst the terrors of death, and the triumphant exultations of

his misguided enemies. His discourse on the scaffold was full of decency

and courage. “He feared,” he said, “that the omen was bad for the intended

reformation of the state, that it commenced with the shedding of innocent

blood.” Having bid a last adieu to his brother and friends who attended

him, and having sent a blessing to his nearer relations who were absent,

“And now,” said he, “I have nigh done! One stroke will make my wife a

widow, my dear children fatherless, deprive my poor servants of their

indulgent master, and separate me from my affectionate brother and all my

friends! But let God be to you and them all in all!” Going to disrobe and

prepare himself for the block, “I thank God,” said he, “that I am nowise

afraid of death, nor am daunted with any terrors; but do as cheerfully lay

down my head at this time as ever I did when going to repose!” With one

blow was a period put to his life by the executioner.[*]

 

Thus perished, in the forty-ninth year of his age, the earl of Strafford,

one of the most eminent personages that has appeared in England. Though

his death was loudly demanded as a satisfaction to justice, and an

atonement for the many violations of the constitution, it may safely be

affirmed, that the sentence by which he fell was an enormity greater than

the worst of those which his implacable enemies prosecuted with so much

cruel industry. The people, in their rage, had totally mistaken the proper

object of their resentment. All the necessities, or, more properly

speaking, the difficulties by which the king had been induced to use

violent expedients for raising supply, were the result of measures

previous to Strafford’s favor; and if they arose from ill conduct, he at

least was entirely innocent. Even those violent expedients themselves,

which occasioned the complaint that the constitution was subverted, had

been, all of them, conducted, so far as appeared, without his counsel or

assistance. And whatever his private advice might be,[**] this salutary

maxim he failed not often and publicly to inculcate in the king’s

presence, that, if any inevitable necessity ever obliged the sovereign to

violate the laws, this license ought to be practised with extreme reserve,

and, as soon as possible, a just atonement be made to the constitution for

any injury which it might sustain from such dangerous precedents.[***] The

first parliament after the restoration reversed the bill of attainder; and

even a few weeks after Strafford’s execution, this very parliament

remitted to his children the more severe consequences of his sentence; as

if conscious of the violence with which the prosecution had been

conducted.

 

In vain did Charles expect, as a return for so many instances of unbounded

compliance, that the parliament would at last show him some indulgence,

and would cordially fall into that unanimity to which, at the expense of

his own power and of his friend’s life, he so earnestly courted them. All

his concessions were poisoned by their suspicion of his want of

cordiality; and the supposed attempt to engage the army against them,

served with many as a confirmation of this jealousy. It was natural for

the king to seek some resource, while all the world seemed to desert him,

or combine against him; and this probably was the utmost of that embryo

scheme which was formed with regard to the army. But the popular leaders

still insisted, that a desperate plot was laid to bring up the forces

immediately, and offer violence to the parliament; a design of which

Piercy’s evidence acquits the king, and which the near neighborhood of the

Scottish army seems to render absolutely impracticable.[*] By means,

however, of these suspicions, was the same implacable spirit still kept

alive; and the commons, without giving the king any satisfaction in the

settlement of his revenue, proceeded to carry their inroads with great

vigor into his now defenceless prerogative.[**]

 

The two ruling passions of this parliament were, zeal for liberty, and an

aversion to the church; and to both of these, nothing could appear more

exceptionable than the court of high commission, whose institution

rendered it entirely arbitrary, and assigned to it the defence of the

ecclesiastical establishment. The star chamber also was a court which

exerted high discretionary powers and had no precise rule or limit, either

with regard to the causes which came under its jurisdiction, or the

decisions which it formed. A bill unanimously passed the houses to abolish

these two courts; and in them to annihilate the principal and most

dangerous articles of the king’s prerogative. By the same bill, the

jurisdiction of the council was regulated, and its authority abridged.[*]

Charles hesitated before he gave his assent. But finding that he had gone

too far to retreat, and that he possessed no resource in case of a

rupture, he at last affixed the royal sanction to this excellent bill. But

to show the parliament that he was sufficiently apprised of the importance

of his grant, he observed to them, that this statute altered in a great

measure the fundamental laws, ecclesiastical and civil, which many of his

predecessors had established.[**]

 

By removing the star chamber, the king’s power of binding the people by

his proclamations was indirectly abolished; and that important branch of

prerogative, the strong symbol of arbitrary power, and unintelligible in a

limited constitution, being at last removed, left the system of government

more consistent and uniform. The star chamber alone was accustomed to

punish infractions of the king’s edicts: but as no courts of judicature

now remained except those in Westminster Hall, which take cognizance only

of common and statute law, the king may thenceforth issue proclamations,

but no man is bound to obey them, It must, however, be confessed, that the

experiment here made by the parliament was not a little rash and

adventurous. No government at that time appeared in the world, nor is

perhaps to be found in the records of any history, which subsisted without

the mixture of some arbitrary authority committed to some magistrate; and

it might reasonably, beforehand, appear doubtful, whether human society

could ever reach that state of perfection, as to support itself with no

other control than the general and rigid maxims of law and equity. But the

parliament justly thought, that the king was too eminent a magistrate to

be trusted with discretionary power, which he might so easily turn to the

destruction of liberty. And in the event, it has hitherto been found,

that, though some sensible inconveniencies arise from the maxim of

adhering strictly to law, yet the advantages overbalance them, and should

render the English grateful to the memory of their ancestors, who, after

repeated contests, at last established that noble, though dangerous

principle.

 

At the request of the parliament, Charles, instead of the patents during

pleasure, gave all the judges patents during their good behavior;[*] a

circumstance of the greatest moment towards securing their independency,

and barring the entrance of arbitrary power into the ordinary courts of

judicature.

 

The marshal’s court, which took cognizance of offensive, words, and was

not thought sufficiently limited by law, was also for that reason

abolished.[**] The stannary courts, which exercised jurisdiction over the

miners, being liable to a like objection, underwent a like fate. The

abolition of the council of the north and the council of Wales followed

from the same principles. The authority of the clerk of the market, who

had a general inspection over the weights and measures throughout the

kingdom, was transferred to the mayors, sheriffs, and ordinary

magistrates.

 

In short, if we take a survey of the transactions of this memorable

parliament during the first period of its operations, we shall find that,

excepting Strafford’s attainder, which was a complication of cruel

iniquity, their merits in other respects so much outweigh their mistakes,

as to entitle them to praise, from all lovers of liberty. Not only were

former abuses remedied, and grievances redressed; great provision for the

future was made by law against the return of like complaints. And if the

means by which they obtained such advantages savor often of artifice,

sometimes of violence, it is to be considered, that revolutions of

government cannot be effected by the mere force of argument and reasoning;

and that factions being once excited, men can neither so firmly regulate

the tempers of others, nor their own, as to insure themselves against all

exorbitances.

 

The parliament now came to a pause. The king had promised his Scottish

subjects that he would this summer pay them a visit, in order to settle

their government; and though the English parliament was very importunate

with him, that he should lay aside that journey, they could not prevail

with him so much as to delay it. As he must necessarily, in his journey,

have passed through the troops of both nations, the commons seem to have

entertained great jealousy on that account, and to have now hurried on, as

much as they formerly delayed, the disbanding of the armies. The arrears,

therefore, of the Scots were fully paid them; and those of the English in

part. The Scots returned home, and the English were separated into their

several counties, and dismissed.

 

After this, the parliament adjourned to the twentieth of October; and a

committee of both houses—a thing unprecedented—was appointed

to sit during the recess, with very ample powers.[*] Pym was elected

chairman of the committee of the lower house. Further attempts were made

by the parliament while it sat, and even by the commons alone for assuming

sovereign executive powers, and publishing their ordinances, as they

called them, instead of laws. The committee too, on their part, was ready

to imitate the example.

 

A small committee of both houses was appointed to attend the king into

Scotland, in order, as was pretended, to see that the articles of

pacification were executed; but really to be spies upon him, and extend

still further the ideas of parliamentary authority, as well as eclipse the

majesty of the king. The earl of Bedford, Lord Howard, Sir Philip

Stapleton, Sir William Armyne, Fiennes, and Hambden, were the persons

chosen.[**]

 

Endeavors were used, before Charles’s departure, to have a protector of

the kingdom appointed, with a power to pass laws without having recourse

to the king: so little regard was now paid to royal authority, or to the

established constitution of the kingdom.

 

Amidst the great variety of affairs which occurred during this busy

period, we have almost overlooked the marriage of the princess Mary with

William, prince of Orange. The king concluded not this alliance without

communicating his intentions to the parliament, who received the proposal

with satisfaction.[*] This was the commencement of the connections with

the family of Orange; connections which were afterwards attended with the

most important consequences, both to the kingdom and to the house of

Stuart.
