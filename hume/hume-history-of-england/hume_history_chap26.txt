After Perkin was repulsed from the coast of Kent, he retired into

Flanders; but as he found it impossible to procure subsistence for himself

and his followers while he remained in tranquillity, he soon after made an

attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared forward to join every

invader of Henry’s authority. But Poynings had now put the affairs of that

island in so good a posture, that Perkin met with little success; and

being tired of the savage life which he was obliged to lead, while

skulking among the wild Irish, he bent his course towards Scotland, and

presented himself to James IV., who then governed that kingdom. He had

been previously recommended to this prince by the king of France, who was

disgusted at Henry for entering into the general league against him; and

this recommendation was even seconded by Maximilian, who, though one of

the confederates, was also displeased with the king, on account of his

prohibiting in England all commerce with the Low Countries. The

countenance given to Perkin by these princes procured him a favorable

reception with the king of Scotland, who assured him, that, whatever he

were, he never should repent putting himself in his hands:[*] the

insinuating address and plausible behavior of the youth himself, seem to

have gained him credit and authority. James, whom years had not yet taught

distrust or caution, was seduced to believe the story of Perkin’s birth

and adventures; and he carried his confidence so far as to give him in

marriage the lady Catharine Gordon, daughter of the earl of Huntley, and

related to himself; a young lady too, eminent for virtue as well as

beauty.

 

1496.

 

There subsisted at that time a great jealousy between the courts of

England and Scotland; and James was probably the more forward on that

account to adopt any fiction which he thought might reduce his enemy to

distress or difficulty. He suddenly resolved to make an inroad into

England, attended by some of the borderers; and he carried Perkin along

with him, in hopes that the appearance of the pretended prince might raise

an insurrection in the northern counties. Perkin himself dispersed a

manifesto, in which he set forth his own story, and craved the assistance

of all his subjects in expelling the usurper, whose tyranny and

maladministration, whose depression of the nobility by the elevation of

mean persons, whose oppression of the people by multiplied impositions and

vexations, had justly, he said, rendered him odious to all men. But

Perkin’s pretensions, attended with repeated disappointments, were now

become stale in the eyes even of the populace; and the hostile

dispositions which subsisted between the kingdoms, rendered a prince

supported by the Scots but an unwelcome present to the English nation. The

ravages also committed by the borderers, accustomed to license and

disorder, struck a terror into all men, and made the people prepare rather

for repelling the invaders than for joining them. Perkin, that he might

support his pretensions to royal birth, feigned great compassion for the

misery of his plundered subjects, and publicly remonstrated with his ally

against the depredations exercised by the Scottish army;[*] but James told

him, that he doubted his concern was employed only in behalf of an enemy,

and that he was anxious to preserve what never should belong to him. That

prince now began to perceive that his attempt would be fruitless; and

hearing of an army which was on its march to attack him, he thought proper

to retreat into his own country.

 

The king discovered little anxiety to procure either reparation or

vengeance for this insult committed on him by the Scottish nation: his

chief concern was to draw advantage from it, by the pretence which it

might afford him to levy impositions on his own subjects. He summoned a

parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints against the irruption of the

Scots, the absurd imposture countenanced by that nation, the cruel

devastations committed in the northern counties, and the multiplied

insults thus offered both to the king and kingdom of England. The

parliament made the expected return to this discourse, by granting a

subsidy to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, together

with two fifteenths. After making this grant, they were dismissed.

 

1497.

 

The vote of parliament for imposing the tax was without much difficulty

procured by the authority of Henry but he found it not so easy to levy the

money upon his subjects. The people, who were acquainted with the immense

treasures which he had amassed, could ill brook the new impositions raised

on every slight occasion; and it is probable that the flaw which was

universally known to be in his title, made his reign the more subject to

insurrections and rebellions. When the subsidy began to be levied in

Cornwall, the inhabitants, numerous and poor, robust and courageous,

murmured against a tax occasioned by a sudden inroad of the Scots, from

which they esteemed themselves entirely secure, and which had usually been

repelled by the force of the northern counties. Their ill humor was

further incited by one Michael Joseph, a farrier of Bodmin, a notable

prating fellow, who, by thrusting himself forward on every occasion, and

being loudest in every complaint against the government, had acquired an

authority among those rude people. Thomas Flammoc, too, a lawyer, who had

become the oracle of the neighborhood, encouraged the sedition, by

informing them that the tax, though imposed by parliament, was entirely

illegal; that the northern nobility were bound by their tenures to defend

the nation against the Scots; and that if these new impositions were

tamely submitted to, the avarice of Henry and of his ministers would soon

render the burden intolerable to the nation. The Cornish, he said, must

deliver to the king a petition, seconded by such a force as would give it

authority; and in order to procure the concurrence of the rest of the

kingdom, care must be taken, by their orderly deportment, to show that

they had nothing in view but the public good, and the redress of all those

grievances under which the people had so long labored.

 

Encouraged by these speeches, the multitude flocked together, and armed

themselves with axes, bills, bows, and such weapons as country people are

usually possessed of. Flammoc and Joseph were chosen their leaders. They

soon conducted the Cornish through the county of Devon, and reached that

of Somerset. At Taunton, the rebels killed, in their fury, an officious

and eager commissioner of the subsidy, whom they called the provost of

Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined by Lord Audley, a

nobleman of an ancient family, popular in his deportment, but vain,

ambitious and restless in his temper. He had from the beginning maintained

a secret correspondence with the first movers of the insurrection, and was

now joyfully received by them as their leader. Proud of the countenance

given them by so considerable a nobleman, they continued their march,

breathing destruction to the king’s ministers and favorites, particularly

to Morton, now a cardinal, and Sir Reginald Bray, who were deemed the most

active instruments in all his oppressions. Notwithstanding their rage

against the administration, they carefully followed the directions given

them by their leaders; and as they met with no resistance, they committed,

during their march, no violence or disorder.

 

The rebels had been told by Flammoc that the inhabitants of Kent, as they

had ever, during all ages, remained unsubdued, and had even maintained

their independence during the Norman conquest, would surely embrace their

party, and declare themselves for a cause which was no other than that of

public good and general liberty. But the Kentish people had very lately

distinguished themselves by repelling Perkin’s invasion; and as they had

received from the king many gracious acknowledgments for this service,

their affections were by that means much conciliated to his government. It

was easy, therefore, for the earl of Kent, Lord Abergavenny, and Lord

Cobham, who possessed great authority in those parts, to retain the people

in obedience; and the Cornish rebels, though they pitched their camp near

Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all the people to join

them, got reÃ«nforcement from no quarter. There wanted not discontents

every where, but no one would take part in so rash and ill-concerted an

enterprise; and besides, the situation in which the king’s affairs then

stood discouraged even the boldest and most daring.

 

Henry, in order to oppose the Scots, had already levied an army, which he

put under the command of Lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and as soon as he

heard of the Cornish insurrection, he ordered it to march southwards and

suppress the rebels. Not to leave the northern frontier defenceless, he

despatched thither the earl of Surrey, who assembled the forces on the

borders, and made head against the enemy. Henry found here the concurrence

of the three most fatal incidents that can befall a monarchy; a foreign

enemy, a domestic rebellion, and a pretender to his crown; but he enjoyed

great resources in his army and treasure, and still more in the

intrepidity and courage of his own temper. He did not, however,

immediately give full scope to his military spirit. On other occasions, he

had always hastened to a decision; and it was a usual saying with him,

“that he desired but to see his rebels:” but as the Cornish mutineers

behaved in an inoffensive manner, and committed no spoil on the country;

as they received no accession of force on their march or in their

encampment, and as such hasty and popular tumults might be expected to

diminish every moment by delay; he took post in London, and assiduously

prepared the means of insuring victory.

 

After all his forces were collected, he divided them into three bodies,

and marched out to assail the enemy. The first body, commanded by the earl

of Oxford, and under him by the earls of Essex and Suffolk, were appointed

to place themselves behind the hill on which the rebels were encamped: the

second, and most considerable, Henry put under the command of Lord

Daubeney, and ordered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on the

action. The third he kept as a body of reserve about his own person, and

took post in St. George’s Fields; where he secured the city, and could

easily, as occasion served, either restore the fight or finish the

victory. To put the enemy off their guard, he had spread a report that he

was not to attack them till some days after; and the better to confirm

them in this opinion, he began not the action till near the evening.

Daubeney beat a detachment of the rebels from Deptford bridge; and before

their main body could be in order to receive him, he had gained the ascent

of the hill, and placed himself in array before them. They were formidable

from their numbers, being sixteen thousand strong, and were not defective

in valor; but being tumultuary troops, ill armed, and not provided with

cavalry or artillery, they were but an unequal match for the king’s

forces. Daubeney began the attack with courage, and even with a contempt

of the enemy which had almost proved fatal to him. He rushed into the

midst of them, and was taken prisoner; but soon after was released by his

own troops. After some resistance, the rebels were broken and put to

flight.[*]

 

Lord Audley, Flammoc, and Joseph, their leaders, were taken, and all three

executed. The latter seemed even to exult in his end, and boasted, with a

preposterous ambition, that he should make a figure in his tory. The

rebels, being surrounded on every side by the king’s troops, were almost

all made prisoners; and immediately dismissed without further punishment:

whether, that Henry was satisfied with the victims who had fallen in the

field, and who amounted to near two thousand, or that he pitied the

ignorance and simplicity of the multitude, or favored them on account of

their inoffensive behavior; or was pleased that they had never, during

their insurrection, disputed his title, and had shown no attachment to the

house of York, the highest crime of which, in his eyes, they could have

been guilty.

 

The Scottish king was not idle during these commotions in England. He

levied a considerable army, and sat down before the Castle of Norham, in

Northumberland; but found that place, by the precaution of Fox, bishop of

Durham, so well provided both with men and ammunition, that he made little

or no progress in the siege. Hearing that the earl of Surrey had collected

some forces, and was advancing upon him, he retreated into his own

country, and left the frontiers exposed to the inroads of the English

general, who besieged and took Aiton, a small castle lying a few miles

beyond Berwick. These unsuccessful or frivolous attempts on both sides

prognosticated a speedy end to the war; and Henry, notwithstanding his

superior force, was no less desirous than James of terminating the

differences between the nations. Not to depart, however, from his dignity,

by making the first advances, he employed in this friendly office Peter

Hialas, a man of address and learning, who had come to him as ambassador

from Ferdinand and Isabella, and who was charged with a commission of

negotiating the marriage of the Infanta Catharine, their daughter, with

Arthur, prince of Wales.[*]

 

Hialas took a journey northwards, and offered his mediation between James

and Henry, as minister of a prince who was in alliance with both

potentates. Commissioners were soon appointed to meet and confer on terms

of accommodation. The first demand of the English was, that Perkin should

be put into their hands: James replied, that he himself was no judge of

the young man’s pretensions; but having received him as a supplicant, and

promised him protection, he was determined not to betray a man who had

trusted to his good faith and his generosity. The next demand of the

English met with no better reception: they required reparation for the

ravages committed by the late inroads into England: the Scottish

commissioners replied, that the spoils were like water spilt upon the

ground, which could never be recovered; and that Henry’s subjects were

better able to bear the loss, than their master to repair it. Henry’s

commissioners next proposed, that the two kings should have an interview

at Newcastle, in order to adjust all differences; but James said, that he

meant to treat of a peace, not to go a begging for it. Lest the

conferences should break off altogether without effect, a truce was

concluded for some months; and James, perceiving that while Perkin

remained in Scotland he himself never should enjoy a solid peace with

Henry, privately desired him to depart the kingdom.

 

Access was now barred Perkin into the Low Countries, his usual retreat in

all his disappointments. The Flemish merchants, who severely felt the loss

resulting from the interruption of commerce with England, had made such

interest in the archduke’s council, that commissioners were sent to

London, in order to treat of an accommodation. The Flemish court agreed,

that all English rebels should be excluded the Low Countries; and in this

prohibition the demesnes of the duchess dowager were expressly

comprehended. When this principal article was agreed to, all the other

terms were easily adjusted. A treaty of commerce was finished, which was

favorable to the Flemings, and to which they long gave the appellation of

“intercursus magnus,” the great treaty. And when the English merchants

returned to their usual abode at Antwerp, they were publicly received, as

in procession, with joy and festivity.

 

Perkin was a Fleming by descent, though born in England; and it might

therefore be doubted whether he were included in the treaty between the

two nations: but as he must dismiss all his English retainers if he took

shelter in the Low Countries, and as he was sure of a cold reception, if

not bad usage, among people who were determined to keep on terms of

friendship with the court of England, he thought fit rather to hide

himself during some time in the wilds and fastnesses of Ireland.

Impatient, however, of a retreat which was both disagreeable and

dangerous, he held consultations with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and

Astley, three broken tradesmen: by their advice he resolved to try the

affections of the Cornish, whose mutinous disposition, notwithstanding the

king’s lenity, still subsisted after the suppression of their rebellion.

No sooner did he appear at Bodmin, in Cornwall, than the populace, to the

number of three thousand, flocked to his standard, and Perkin, elated with

this appearance of success, took on him, for the first time, the

appellation of Richard IV., king of England. Not to suffer the

expectations of his followers to languish, he presented himself before

Exeter; and by many fair promises invited that city to join him. Finding

that the inhabitants shut their gates against him, he laid siege to the

place; but being unprovided with artillery, ammunition, and every thing

requisite for the attempt, he made no progress in his undertaking.

Messengers were sent to the king, informing him of this insurrection: the

citizens of Exeter meanwhile were determined to hold out to the last

extremity, in expectation of receiving succor from the well-known

vigilance of that monarch.

 

When Henry was informed that Perkin was landed in England, he expressed

great joy, and prepared himself with alacrity to attack him, in hopes of

being able, at length, to put a period to pretensions which had so long

given him vexation and inquietude. All the courtiers, sensible that their

activity on this occasion would be the most acceptable service which they

could render the king, displayed their zeal for the enterprise, and

forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney and Broke, with Sir Rice ap

Thomas, hastened forward with a small body of troops to the relief of

Exeter. The earl of Devonshire, and the most considerable gentlemen in the

county of that name, took arms of their own accord, and marched to join

the king’s generals. The duke of Buckingham put himself at the head of a

troop, consisting of young nobility and gentry, who served as volunteers,

and who longed for an opportunity of displaying their courage and their

loyalty. The king himself prepared to follow with a considerable army; and

thus all England seemed united against a pretender who had at first

engaged their attention and divided their affections.

 

Perkin, informed of these great preparations, immediately raised the siege

of Exeter, and retired to Taunton. Though his followers now amounted to

the number of near seven thousand, and seemed still resolute to maintain

his cause, he himself despaired of success, and secretly withdrew to the

sanctuary of Beaulieu, in the new forest. The Cornish rebels submitted to

the king’s mercy, and found that it was not yet exhausted in their behalf.

Except a few persons of desperate fortunes, who were executed, and some

others who were severely fined, all the rest were dismissed with impunity

Lady Catharine Gordon, wife to Perkin fell into the hands of the victor,

and was treated with a generosity which does him honor. He soothed her

mind with many marks of regard, placed her in a reputable station about

the queen and assigned her a pension, which she enjoyed even under his

successor.

 

1498.

 

Henry deliberated what course to take with Perkin himself. Some counselled

him to make the privileges of the church yield to reasons of state, to

take him by violence from the sanctuary, to inflict on him the punishment

due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an end to an imposture which

had long disturbed the government, and which the credulity of the people

and the artifices of malcontents were still capable of reviving. But the

king deemed not the matter of such importance as to merit so violent a

remedy, He employed some persons to deal with Perkin, and persuade him,

under promise of pardon, to deliver himself into the king’s hands.[*] The

king conducted him in a species of mock triumph to London. As Perkin

passed along the road and through the streets of the city, men of all

ranks flocked about him, and the populace treated with the highest

derision his fallen fortunes. They seemed desirous of revenging

themselves, by their insults, for the shame which their former belief of

his impostures had thrown upon them. Though the eyes of the nation were

generally opened with regard to Perkin’s real parentage, Henry required of

him a confession of his life and adventures; and he ordered the account of

the whole to be dispersed soon after, for the satisfaction of the public.

But as his regard to decency made him entirely suppress the share which

the duchess of Burgundy had had in contriving and conducting the

imposture, the people, who knew that she had been the chief instrument in

the whole affair, were inclined, on account of the silence on that head,

to pay the less credit to the authenticity of the narrative.

 

1499.

 

But Perkin, though his life was granted him, was still detained in

custody; and keepers were appointed to guard him. Impatient of

confinement, he broke from his keepers, and flying to the sanctuary of

Shyne, put himself into the hands of the prior of that monastery. The

prior had obtained great credit by his character of sanctity; and he

prevailed on the king again to grant a pardon to Perkin. But in order to

reduce him to still greater contempt, he was set in the stocks at

Westminster and Cheapside, and obliged in both places to read aloud to the

people the confession which had formerly been published in his name. He

was then confined to the Tower, where his habits of restless intrigue and

enterprise followed him. He insinuated himself into the intimacy of four

servants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and by their means

opened a correspondence with the earl of Warwick, who was confined in the

same prison. This unfortunate prince, who had from his earliest youth been

shut up from the commerce of men, and who was ignorant even of the most

common Affairs of life, had fallen into a simplicity which made him

susceptible of any impression. The continued dread also of the more

violent effects of Henry’s tyranny, joined to the natural love of liberty,

engaged him to embrace a project for his escape, by the murder of the

lieutenant; and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enterprise. The

conspiracy escaped not the king’s vigilance: it was even very generally

believed, that the scheme had been laid by himself, in order to draw

Warwick and Perkin into the snare; but the subsequent execution of two of

Digby’s servants for the contrivance seems to clear the king of that

imputation, which was indeed founded more on the general idea entertained

of his character than on any positive evidence.

 

Perkin, by this new attempt, after so many enormities, had rendered

himself totally unworthy of mercy; and he was accordingly arraigned,

condemned, and soon after hanged at Tyburn, persisting still in the

confession of his imposture.[*] 1 It happened about that very time that one

Wilford, a cordwainer’s son, encouraged by the surprising credit given to

other impostures, had undertaken to personate the earl of Warwick; and a

priest had even ventured from the pulpit to recommend his cause to the

people, who seemed still to retain a propensity to adopt it. This incident

served Henry as a pretence for his severity towards that prince. He was

brought to trial, and accused, not of contriving his escape, (for as he

was committed for no crime, the desire of liberty must have been regarded

as natural and innocent,) but of forming designs to disturb the

government, and raise an insurrection among the people. Warwick confessed

the indictment was condemned, and the sentence was executed upon him.

 

This violent act of tyranny, the great blemish of Henry’s reign, by which

he destroyed the last remaining male of the line of Plantagenet, begat

great discontent among the people, who saw an unhappy prince, that had

long been denied all the privileges of his high birth, even been cut off

from the common benefits of nature, now at last deprived of life itself,

merely for attempting to shake off that oppression under which he labored.

In vain did Henry endeavor to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by

sharing it with his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he said, had scrupled

to give his daughter Catharine in marriage to Arthur while any male

descendant of the house of York remained. Men, on the contrary, felt

higher indignation at seeing a young prince sacrificed, not to law and

justice, but to the jealous politics of two subtle and crafty tyrants.

 

But though these discontents festered in the minds of men, they were so

checked by Henry’s watchful policy and steady severity, that they seemed

not to weaken his government; and foreign princes, deeming his throne now

entirely secure, paid him rather the greater deference and attention. The

archduke Philip, in particular, desired an interview with him; and Henry,

who had passed over to Calais, agreed to meet him in St. Peter’s church,

near that city. The archduke, on his approaching the king, made haste to

alight, and offered to hold Henry’s stirrup; a mark of condescension which

that prince would not admit of. He called the king “father,” “patron,”

“protector;” and by his whole behavior expressed a strong desire of

conciliating the friendship of England. The duke of Orleans had succeeded

to the crown of France by the appellation of Lewis XII.; and having

carried his arms into Italy, and subdued the duchy of Milan, his progress

begat jealousy in Maximilian, Philip’s father, as well as in Ferdinand,

his father-in-law. By the counsel, therefore, of these monarchs, the young

prince endeavored by every art to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they

regarded as the chief counterpoise to the greatness of France. No

particular plan, however, of alliance seems to have been concerted between

these two princes in their interview: all passed in general professions of

affection and regard; at least, in remote projects of a closer union, by

the future intermarriages of their children, who were then in a state of

infancy.

 

1500.

 

The Pope, too, Alexander VI., neglected not the friendship of a monarch

whose reputation was spread over Europe. He sent a nuncio into England,

who exhorted the king to take part in the great alliance projected for the

recovery of the Holy Land, and to lead in person his forces against the

infidels. The general frenzy for crusades was now entirely exhausted in

Europe; but it was still thought a necessary piece of decency to pretend

zeal for those pious enterprises. Henry regretted to the nuncio the

distance of his situation, which rendered it inconvenient for him to

expose his person in defence of the Christian cause. He promised, however,

his utmost assistance by aids and contributions; and rather than the pope

should go alone to the holy wars, unaccompanied by any monarch, he even

promised to overlook all other considerations, and to attend him in

person. He only required, as a necessary condition, that all differences

should previously be adjusted among Christian princes, and that some

seaport towns in Italy should be consigned to him for his retreat and

security. It was easy to conclude that Henry had determined not to

intermeddle in any war against the Turk; but as a great name, without any

real assistance, is sometimes of service, the knights of Rhodes, who were

at that time esteemed the bulwark of Christendom, chose the king protector

of their order.

 

But the prince whose alliance Henry valued the most was Ferdinand of

Arragon, whose vigorous and steady policy, always attended with success,

had rendered him in many respects the most considerable monarch in Europe.

There was also a remarkable similarity of character between these two

princes; both were full of craft, intrigue, and design: and though a

resemblance of this nature be a slender foundation for confidence and

amity, where the interests of the parties in the least interfere, such was

the situation of Henry and Ferdinand, that no jealousy ever on any

occasion arose between them. The king had now the satisfaction of

completing a marriage, which had been projected and negotiated during the

course of seven years, between Arthur, prince of Wales, and the infanta

Catharine, fourth daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella; he near sixteen

years of age, she eighteen. But this marriage proved in the issue

unprosperous. The young prince, a few months after, sickened and died,

much regretted by the nation.

 

1502.

 

Henry, desirous to continue his alliance with Spain, and also unwilling to

restore Catharine’s dowry, which was two hundred thousand ducats, obliged

his second son, Henry, whom he created prince of Wales, to be contracted

to the infanta. The prince made all the opposition of which a youth of

twelve years of age was capable; but as the king persisted in his

resolution, the espousals were at length, by means of the pope’s

dispensation, contracted between the parties; an event which was

afterwards attended with the most important consequences.

 

The same year another marriage was celebrated, which was also, in the next

age, productive of great events; the marriage of Margaret, the king’s

eldest daughter, with James, king of Scotland. This alliance had been

negotiated during three years, though interrupted by several broils; and

Henry hoped, from the completion of it, to remove all source of discord

with that neighboring kingdom, by whose animosity England had so often

been infested. When this marriage was deliberated on in the English

council, some objected, that England might, by means of that alliance,

fall under the dominion of Scotland. “No,” replied Henry, “Scotland, in

that event, will only become an accession to England.”

 

1503.

 

Amidst these prosperous incidents, the king met with a domestic calamity,

which made not such impression on him as it merited: his queen died in

childbed; and the infant did not long survive her. This princess was

deservedly a favorite of the nation; and the general affection for her

increased, on account of the harsh treatment which it was thought she met

with from her consort.

 

The situation of the king’s affairs, both at home and abroad, was now in

every respect very fortunate. All the efforts of the European princes,

both in war and negotiation, were turned to the side of Italy; and the

various events which there arose, made Henry’s alliance be courted by

every party, yet interested him so little as never to touch him with

concern or anxiety. His close connections with-Spain and Scotland insured

his tranquillity; and his continued successes over domestic enemies, owing

to the prudence and vigor of his conduct, had reduced the people to entire

submission and obedience. Uncontrolled, therefore, by apprehension or

opposition of any kind, he gave full scope to his natural propensity; and

avarice, which had ever been his ruling passion being increased by age and

encouraged by absolute authority broke all restraints of shame or justice.

He had found two ministers Empson and Dudley, perfectly qualified to

second his rapacious and tyrannical inclinations, and to prey upon his

defenceless people. These instruments of oppression were both lawyers; the

first of mean birth, of brutal manners, of an unrelenting temper; the

second better born, better educated, and better bred, but equally unjust,

severe, and inflexible. By their knowledge in law, these men were

qualified to pervert the forms of justice to the oppression of the

innocent; and the formidable authority of the king supported them in all

their iniquities.

 

It was their usual practice, at first, to observe so far the appearance of

law as to give indictments to those whom they intended to oppress; upon

which the persons were committed to prison, but never brought to trial;

and were at length obliged, in order to recover their liberty, to pay

heavy fines and ransoms, which were called mitigations and compositions.

By degrees, the very appearance of law was neglected: the two ministers

sent forth their precepts to attach men, and summon them before themselves

and some others, at their private houses, in a court of commission, where,

in a summary manner, without trial or jury, arbitrary decrees were issued,

both in pleas of the crown and controversies between private parties.

Juries themselves, when summoned, proved but small security to the

subject; being browbeaten by these oppressors; nay, fined, imprisoned, and

punished, if they gave sentence against the inclination of the ministers

The whole system of the feudal law, which still prevailed, was turned into

a scheme of oppression. Even the king’s wards, after they came of age,

were not suffered to enter into possession of their lands without paying

exorbitant fines. Men were also harassed with informations of intrusion

upon scarce colorable titles. When an outlawry in a personal action was

issued against any man, he was not allowed to purchase his charter of

pardon, except on the payment of a great sum; and if he refused the

composition required of him, the strict law, which in such cases allows

forfeiture of goods, was rigorously insisted on. Nay, without any color of

law, the half of men’s lands and rents were seized during two years, as a

penalty in case of outlawry. But the chief means of oppression employed by

these ministers were the penal statutes, which, without consideration of

rank, quality, or services, were rigidly put in execution against all men:

spies, informers, and inquisitors were rewarded and encouraged in every

quarter of the kingdom: and no difference was made, whether the statute

were beneficial or hurtful, recent or obsolete, possible or impossible to

be executed. The sole end of the king and his ministers was to amass

money, and bring every one under the lash of their authority.[*]

 

Through the prevalence of such an arbitrary and iniquitous administration,

the English, it may safely be affirmed, were considerable losers by their

ancient privileges, which secured them from all taxations, except such as

were imposed by their own consent in parliament. Had the king been

empowered to levy general taxes at pleasure, he would naturally have

abstained from these oppressive expedients, which destroyed all security

in private property, and begat a universal diffidence throughout the

nation. In vain did the people look for protection from the parliament,

which was pretty frequently summoned during this reign.

 

1504.

 

That assembly was so overawed, that at this very time, during the greatest

rage of Henry’s oppressions, the commons chose Dudley their speaker, the

very man who was the chief instrument of his iniquities. And though the

king was known to be immensely opulent, and had no pretence of wars or

expensive enterprises of any kind, they granted him the subsidy which he

demanded. But so insatiable was his avarice, that next year he levied a

new benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and oppressive method of

taxation.

 

1505.

 

By all these arts of accumulation, joined to a rigid frugality in his

expense, he so filled his coffers, that he is said to have possessed in

ready money the sum of one million eight hundred thousand pounds; a

treasure almost incredible, if we consider the scarcity of money in those

times.[**]

 

But while Henry was enriching himself by the spoils of his oppressed

people, there happened an event abroad which engaged his attention, and

was even the object of his anxiety and concern: Isabella, queen of

Castile, died about this time and it was foreseen that by this incident

the fortunes of Ferdinand, her husband, would be much affected. The king

was not only attentive to the fate of his ally, and watchful lest the

general system of Europe should be affected by so important an event; he

also considered the similarity of his own situation with that of

Ferdinand, and regarded the issue of these transactions as a precedent for

himself. Joan, the daughter of Ferdinand by Isabella, was married to the

archduke Philip, and being, in right of her mother, heir of Castile,

seemed entitled to dispute with Ferdinand the present possession of that

kingdom. Henry knew that, notwithstanding his own pretensions by the house

of Lancaster, the greater part of the nation was convinced of the

superiority of his wife’s title; and he dreaded lest the prince of Wales,

who was daily advancing towards manhood, might be tempted by ambition to

lay immediate claim to the crown. By his perpetual attention to depress

the partisans of the York family, he had more closely united them into one

party, and increased their desire of shaking off that yoke under which

they had so long labored, and of taking every advantage which his

oppressive government should give his enemies against him. And as he

possessed no independent force like Ferdinand, and governed a kingdom more

turbulent and unruly, which he himself by his narrow politics had

confirmed in factious prejudices, he apprehended that his situation would

prove in the issue still more precarious.

 

Nothing at first could turn out more contrary to the king’s wishes than

the transactions in Spain. Ferdinand, as well as Henry, had become very

unpopular, and from a like cause, his former exactions and impositions;

and the states of Castile discovered an evident resolution of preferring

the title of Philip and Joan.

 

1506.

 

In order, to take advantage of these favorable dispositions, the archduke,

now king of Castile, attended by his consort, embarked for Spain during

the winter season; but meeting with a violent tempest in the Channel, was

obliged to take shelter in the harbor of Weymouth. Sir John Trenchard, a

gentleman of authority in the county of Dorset, hearing of a fleet upon

the coast, had assembled some forces; and being joined by Sir John Cary,

who was also at the head of an armed body, he came to that town. Finding

that Philip, in order to relieve his sickness and fatigue, was already

come ashore, he invited him to his house; and immediately despatched a

messenger to inform the court of this important incident. The king sent in

all haste the earl of Arundel to compliment Philip on his arrival in

England, and to inform him that he intended to pay him a visit in person,

and to give him a suitable reception in his dominions. Philip knew that he

could not now depart without the king’s consent; and therefore, for the

sake of despatch, he resolved to anticipate his visit, and to have an

interview with him at Windsor. Henry received him with all the

magnificence possible, and with all the seeming cordiality; but he

resolved, notwithstanding, to draw some advantage from this involuntary

visit paid him by his royal guest.

 

Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward IV. and brother to

the earl of Lincoln, slain in the battle of Stoke, had some years before

killed a man in a sudden fit of passion, and had been obliged to apply to

the king for a remission of the crime. The king had granted his request;

but, being little indulgent to all persons connected with the house of

York, he obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his pardon.

Suffolk, more resenting the affront than grateful for the favor, had fled

into Flanders, and taken shelter with his aunt, the duchess of Burgundy;

but being promised forgiveness by the king, he returned to England, and

obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however, by the natural inquietude of his

temper and uneasy from debts which he had contracted by his great expense

at Prince Arthur’s wedding, he again made an elopement into Flanders. The

king, well acquainted with the general discontent which prevailed against

his administration neglected not this incident, which might become of

importance, and he employed his usual artifices to elude the efforts of

his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Curson, governor of the castle of

Hammes, to desert his charge, and to insinuate himself into the confidence

of Suffolk, by making him a tender of his services. Upon information

secretly conveyed by Curson, the king seized William Courtney, eldest son

to the earl of Devonshire, and married to the lady Catharine, sister of

the queen; William de la Pole, brother to the earl of Suffolk; Sir James

Tyrrel, and Sir James Windham, with some persons of inferior quality; and

he committed them to custody. Lord Abergavenny and Sir Thomas Green were

also apprehended; but were soon after released from their confinement.

William de la Pole was long detained in prison: Courtney was attainted,

and, though not executed, he recovered not his liberty during the king’s

lifetime. But Henry’s chief severity fell upon Sir James Windham and Sir

James Tyrrel, who were brought to their trial, condemned, and executed:

the fate of the latter gave general satisfaction, on account of his

participation in the murder of the young princes, sons of Edward IV.

Notwithstanding these discoveries and executions, Curson was still able to

maintain his credit with the earl of Suffolk: Henry, in order to remove

all suspicion, had ordered him to be excommunicated, together with Suffolk

himself, for his pretended rebellion. But after that traitor had performed

all the services expected from him, he suddenly deserted the earl, and

came over to England, where the king received him with unusual marks of

favor and confidence. Suffolk, astonished at this instance of perfidy,

finding that even the duchess of Burgundy, tired with so many fruitless

attempts, had become indifferent to his cause, fled secretly into France,

thence into Germany, and returned at last into the Low Countries; where he

was protected, though not countenanced, by Philip, then in close alliance

with the king.

 

Henry neglected not the present opportunity of complaining to his guest of

the reception which Suffolk had met with in his dominions. “I really

thought,” replied the king of Castile, “that your greatness and felicity

had set you far above apprehensions from any person of so little

consequence: but, to give you satisfaction, I shall banish him my state.”

“I expect that you will carry your complaisance further,” said the king;

“I desire to have Suffolk put into my hands, where alone I can depend upon

his submission and obedience.” “That measure,” said Philip, “will reflect

dishonor upon you as well as myself. You will be thought to have treated

me as a prisoner.” “Then the matter is at an end,” replied the king; “for

I will take that dishonor upon me; and so your honor is saved.”[*] The

king of Castile found himself under a necessity of complying; but he first

exacted Henry’s promise that he would spare Suffolk’s life. That nobleman

was invited over to England by Philip; as if the king would grant him a

pardon, on the intercession of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance,

he was committed to the Tower; and the king of Castile, having fully

satisfied Henry, as well by this concession as by signing a treaty of

commerce between England and Castile, which was advantageous to the former

kingdom,[*] was at last allowed to depart, after a stay of three months.

 

He landed in Spain, was joyfully received by the Castilians, and pit in

possession of the throne.

 

1507.

 

He died soon after; and Joan, his widow, falling into deep melancholy

Ferdinand was again enabled to reinstate himself in authority, and to

govern, till the day of his death, the whole Spanish monarchy.

 

The king survived these transactions two years; but nothing memorable

occurs in the remaining part of his reign, except his affiancing his

second daughter, Mary, to the young archduke Charles, son of Philip of

Castile.

 

1508.

 

He entertained also some intentions of marriage for himself, first with

the queen dowager of Naples, relict of Ferdinand; afterwards with the

duchess dowager of Savoy, daughter of Maximilian, and sister of Philip.

But the decline of his health put an end to all such thoughts; and he

began to cast his eye towards that future existence which the iniquities

and severities of his reign rendered a very dismal prospect to him. To

allay the terrors under which he labored, he endeavored, by distributing

alms and founding religious houses, to make atonement for his crimes, and

to purchase, by the sacrifice of part of his ill-gotten treasures, a

reconciliation with his offended Maker. Remorse even seized him at

intervals for the abuse of his authority by Empson and Dudley; but not

sufficient to make him stop the rapacious hand of those oppressors. Sir

William Capel was again fined two thousand pounds under some frivolous

pretence, and was committed to the Tower for daring to murmur against the

iniquity. Harris, an alderman of London, was indicted, and died of

vexation before his trial came to an issue. Sir Laurence Ailmer, who had

been mayor, and his two sheriffs, were condemned in heavy fines, and sent

to prison till they made payment. The king gave countenance to all these

oppressions; till death, by its nearer approaches, impressed new terrors

upon him; and he then ordered, by a general clause in his will, that

restitution should be made to all those whom he had injured.

 

1509.

 

He died of a consumption at his favorite palace of Richmond, after a reign

of twenty-three years and eight months, and in the fifty-second year of

his age.[*]

 

The reign of Henry VII. was, in the main, fortunate for his people at

home, and honorable abroad. He put an end to the civil wars with which the

nation had long been harassed, he maintained peace and order in the state,

he depressed the former exorbitant power of the nobility, and, together

with the friendship of some foreign princes, he acquired the consideration

and regard of all. He loved peace without fearing war though agitated with

continual suspicions of his servants and ministers, he discovered no

timidity, either in the conduct of his affairs, or in the day of battle;

and though often severe in his punishments, he was commonly less actuated

by revenge than by maxims of policy. The services which he rendered the

people were derived from his views of private advantage, rather than the

motives of public spirit; and where he deviated from interested regards,

it was unknown to himself, and ever from the malignant prejudices of

faction, or the mean projects of avarice; not from the sallies of passion,

or allurements of pleasure; still less from the benign motives of

friendship and generosity. His capacity was excellent, but somewhat

contracted by the narrowness of his heart; he possessed insinuation and

address, but never employed these talents, except where some great point

of interest was to be gained; and while he neglected to conciliate the

affections of his people, he often felt the danger of resting his

authority on their fear and reverence alone. He was always extremely

attentive to his affairs; but possessed not the faculty of seeing far into

futurity; and was more expert at providing a remedy for his mistakes than

judicious in avoiding them. Avarice was, on the whole, his ruling

passion;[*] and he remains an instance, almost singular, of a man placed

hi a high station, and possessed of talents for great affairs, in whom

that passion pre-dominated above ambition. Even among private persons,

avarice is commonly nothing but a species of ambition, and is chiefly

incited by the prospect of that regard, distinction, and consideration,

which attend on riches.

 

The power of the kings of England had always been somewhat irregular or

discretionary; but was scarcely ever so absolute during any former reign,

at least after the establishment of the Great Charter, as during that of

Henry Besides the advantages derived from the personal character of the

man, full of vigor, industry, and severity, deliberate in all projects,

steady in every purpose, and attended with caution as well as good fortune

in every enterprise; he came to the throne after long and bloody civil

wars, which had destroyed all the great nobility, who alone could resist

the encroachments of his authority; the people were tired with discord and

intestine convulsions, and willing to submit to usurpations, and even to

injuries, rather than plunge themselves anew into like miseries: the

fruitless efforts made against him served always, as is usual, to confirm

his authority: as he ruled by a faction, and the lesser faction, all those

on whom he conferred offices, sensible that they owed every thing to his

protection, were willing to support his power, though at the expense of

justice and national privileges. These seem the chief causes which at this

time bestowed on the crown so considerable an addition of prerogative, and

rendered the present reign a kind of epoch in the English constitution.

 

This prince, though he exalted his prerogative above law is celebrated by

his historian for many good laws, which he made be enacted for the

government of his subjects. Several considerable regulations, indeed, are

found among the statutes of this reign, both with regard to the police of

the kingdom, and its commerce: but the former are generally contrived with

much better judgment than the latter. The more simple ideas of order and

equity are sufficient to guide a legislator in every thing that regards

the internal administration of justice: but the principles of commerce are

much more complicated, and require long experience and deep reflection to

be well understood in any state. The real consequence of a law or practice

is there often contrary to first appearances. No wonder that during the

reign of Henry VII.[*,] these matters were frequently mistaken; and it may

safely be affirmed, that even in the age of Lord Bacon, very imperfect and

erroneous ideas were formed on that subject.

 

Early in Henry’s reign, the authority of the star chamber, which was

before founded on common law and ancient practice, was in some cases

confirmed by act of parliament: [*] 2 Lord Bacon extols the

utility of this court; but men began even during the age of that

historian, to feel that so arbitrary a jurisdiction was incompatible with

liberty; and in proportion as the spirit of independence still rose higher

in the nation, the aversion to it increased, till it was entirely

abolished by act of parliament in the reign of Charles I., a little before

the commencement of the civil wars.

 

Laws were passed in this reign, ordaining the king’s suit for murder to be

carried on within a year and a day.[*] Formerly it did not usually

commence till after; and as the friends of the person murdered often in

the interval compounded matters with the criminal, the crime frequently

passed unpunished. Suits were given to the poor “in forma pauperis,” as it

is called; that is, without paying dues for the writs, or any fees to the

council:[**] a good law at all times, especially in that age, when the

people labored under the oppression of the great; but a law difficult to

be carried into execution. A law was made against carrying off any woman

by force.[***] The benefit of clergy was abridged;[****] and the criminal,

on the first offence, was ordered to be burned in the hand with a letter

denoting his crime; after which he was punished capitally for any new

offence. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine any person, without

previously summoning him before their court.[v] It is strange that such a

practice should ever have prevailed. Attaint of juries was granted in

cases which exceeded forty pounds’ value; [v*] a law which has an

appearance of equity, but which was afterwards found inconvenient. Actions

popular were not allowed to be eluded by fraud or covin. If any servant of

the king’s conspired against the life of the steward, treasurer, or

comptroller of the king’s household, this design, though not followed by

any overt act, was made liable to the punishment of felony.[v**] This

statute was enacted for the security of Archbishop Morton, who found

himself exposed to the enmity of great numbers.

 

There scarcely passed any session during this reign without some statute

against engaging retainers, and giving them badges or liveries; [v***] a

practice by which they were in a manner enlisted under some great lord and

were kept in readiness to assist him in all wars, insurrections, riots,

violences, and even in bearing evidence for him in courts of

justice.[v****]

 

This disorder, which had prevailed during many reigns, when the law could

give little protection to the subject, was then deeply rooted in England;

and it required all the vigilance and rigor of Henry to extirpate it.

There is a story of his severity against this abuse; and it seems to merit

praise, though it is commonly cited as an instance of his avarice and

rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favorite general, in whom he always

placed great and deserved confidence, having splendidly entertained him at

his castle of Heningham, was desirous of making a parade of his

magnificence at the departure of his royal guest, and ordered all his

retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up in two lines,

that their appearance might be the more gallant and splendid. “My lord,”

said the king, “I have heard much of your hospitality, but the truth far

exceeds the report. These handsome gentlemen and yeomen, whom I see on

both sides of me, are no doubt your menial servants.” The earl smiled, and

confessed that his fortune was too narrow for such magnificence. “They are

most of them,” subjoined he, “my retainers, who are come to do me service

at this time, when they know I am honored with your majesty’s presence.”

The king started a little, and said, “By my faith, my lord, I thank you

for your good cheer, but I must not allow my laws to be broken in my

sight. My attorney must speak with you.” Oxford is said to have paid no

less than fifteen thousand marks, as a composition for his offence.

 

The increase of the arts, more effectually than all the severities of law,

put an end to this pernicious practice. The nobility, instead of vying

with each other in the number and boldness of their retainers, acquired by

degrees a more civilized species of emulation, and endeavored to excel in

the splendor and elegance of their equipage, houses, and tables. The

common people, no longer maintained in vicious idleness by their

superiors, were obliged to learn some calling or industry, and became

useful both to themselves and to others. And it must be acknowledged, in

spite of those who declaim so violently against refinement in the arts, or

what they are pleased to call luxury, that, as much as an industrious

tradesman is both a better man and a better citizen than one of those idle

retainers who formerly depended on the great families, so much is the life

of a modern nobleman more laudable than that of an ancient baron.[*]

 

But the most important law, in its consequences, which was enacted during

the reign of Henry, was that by which the nobility and gentry acquired a

power of breaking the ancient entails, and of alienating their estates.[*]

By means of this law, joined to the beginning luxury and refinements of

the age, the great fortunes of the barons were gradually dissipated, and

the property of the commons increased in England. It is probable that

Henry foresaw and intended this consequence; because the constant scheme

of his policy consisted in depressing the great, and exalting churchmen,

lawyers, and men of new families, who were more dependent on him.

 

This king’s love of money naturally led him to encourage commerce, which

increased his customs; but, if we may judge by most of the laws enacted

during his reign, trade and industry were rather hurt than promoted by the

care and attention given to them. Severe laws were made against taking

interest for money, which was then denominated usury.[*] 3 Even the

profits of exchange were prohibited, as savoring of usury,[**] which the

superstition of the age zealously proscribed. All evasive contracts, by

which profits could be made from the loan of money, were also carefully

guarded against.[***] It is needless to observe how unreasonable and

iniquitous these laws, how impossible to be executed, and how hurtful to

trade, if they could take place. We may observe, however, to the praise of

this king, that sometimes, in order to promote commerce, he lent to

merchants sums of money without interest, when he knew that their stock

was not sufficient for those enterprises which they had in view.[****]

 

Laws were made against the exportation of money, plate, or bullion: [v] a

precaution which serves to no other purpose than to make more be exported.

 

But so far was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchants alien, who

imported commodities into the kingdom, were obliged to invest in English

commodities all the money acquired by their sales, in order to prevent

their conveying it away in a clandestine manner.[*]

 

It was prohibited to export horses; as if that exportation did not

encourage the breed, and render them more plentiful in the kingdom.[**] In

order to promote archery, no bows were to be sold at a higher price than

six shillings and fourpence,[***] reducing money to the denomination of

our time. The only effect of this regulation must be, either that the

people would be supplied with bad bows, or none at all. Prices were also

affixed to woollen cloth,[****] to caps and hats:[v] and the wages of

laborers were regulated by law.[v*] It is evident, that these matters

ought always to be left free, and be intrusted to the common course of

business and commerce. To some it may appear surprising, that the price of

a yard of scarlet cloth should be limited to six and twenty shillings,

money of our age; that of a yard of colored cloth to eighteen; higher

prices than these commodities bear at present; and that the wages of a

tradesman, such as a mason, bricklayer, tiler, etc., should be regulated

at near tenpence a day; which is not much inferior to the present wages

given in some parts of England. Labor and commodities have certainly risen

since the discovery of the West Indies; but not so much in every

particular as is generally imagined. The greater industry of the present

times has increased the number of tradesmen and laborers, so as to keep

wages nearer a par than could be expected from the great increase of gold

and silver. And the additional art employed in the finer manufactures has

even made some of these commodities fall below their former value. Not to

mention, that merchants and dealers, being contented with less profit than

formerly, afford the goods cheaper to their customers. It appears by a

statute of this reign,[v**] that goods bought for sixteenpence would

sometimes be sold by the merchants for three shillings.

 

The commodities whose price has chiefly risen, are butcher’s meat, fowl,

and fish, (especially the latter,) which cannot be much augmented in

quantity by the increase of art and industry. The profession which then

abounded most, and was sometimes embraced by persons of the lowest rank,

was the church: by a clause of a statute, all clerks or students of the

university were forbidden to beg, without a permission from the

vice-chancellor.[*]

 

One great cause of the low state of industry during this period, was the

restraints put upon it; and the parliament, or rather the king, (for he

was the prime mover in every thing,) enlarged a little some of these

limitations; but not to the degree that was requisite. A law had been

enacted during the reign of Henry IV.,[**] that no man could bind his son

or daughter to an apprenticeship, unless he were possessed of twenty

shillings a year in land; and Henry VII., because the decay of

manufactures was complained of in Norwich from the want of hands, exempted

that city from the penalties of the law.[***] Afterwards the whole county

of Norfolk obtained a like exemption with regard to some branches of the

woollen manufacture.[****] These absurd limitations proceeded from a

desire of promoting husbandry, which, however, is never more effectually

encouraged than by the increase of manufactures. For a like reason, the

law enacted against enclosures, and for the keeping up of farm houses,[v]

scarcely deserves the high praises bestowed on it by Lord Bacon. If

husbandmen understand agriculture, and have a ready vent for their

commodities, we need not dread a diminution of the people employed in the

country. All methods of supporting populousness, except by the interest of

the proprietors, are violent and ineffectual. During a century and a half

after this period, there was a frequent renewal of laws and edicts against

depopulation; whence we may infer, that none of them were ever executed.

The natural course of improvement at last provided a remedy.

 

One check to industry in England was the erecting of corporations; an

abuse which is not yet entirely corrected. A law was enacted, that

corporations should not pass any by-laws without the consent of three of

the chief officers of state.[*] They were prohibited from imposing tolls

at their [**] The cities of Glocester and Worcester had even imposed tolls

on the Severn, which were abolished.[***]

 

There is a law of this reign,[****] containing a preamble, by which it

appears, that the company of merchant adventurers in London had, by their

own authority, debarred all the other merchants of the kingdom from

trading to the great marts in the Low Countries, unless each trader

previously paid them the sum of near seventy pounds. It is surprising that

such a by-law (if it deserve the name) could ever be carried into

execution, and that the authority of parliament should be requisite to

abrogate it.

 

It was during this reign, on the second of August, 1492, a little before

sunset, that Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, set out from Spain on his

memorable voyage for the discovery of the western world; and a few years

after, Vasquez de Gama, a Portuguese, passed the Cape of Good Hope, and

opened a new passage to the East Indies. These great events were attended

with important consequences to all the nations of Europe, even to such as

were not immediately concerned in those naval enterprises. The enlargement

of commerce and navigation increased industry and the arts every where;

the nobles dissipated their fortunes in expensive pleasures: men of an

inferior rank both acquired a share in the landed property, and created to

themselves a considerable property of a new kind, in stock, commodities,

art, credit, and correspondence. In some nations, the privileges of the

commons increased by this increase of property: in most nations, the

kings, finding arms to be dropped by the barons, who could no longer

endure their former rude manner of life, established standing armies, and

subdued the liberties of their kingdoms: but in all places, the condition

of the people, from the depression of the petty tyrants by whom they had

formerly been oppressed rather than governed, received great improvement,

and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at least the most considerable

advantages of it. And as the general course of events thus tended to

depress the nobles and exalt the people, Henry VII., who also embraced

that system of policy, has acquired more praise than his institutions,

strictly speaking, seem of themselves to deserve on account of any

profound wisdom attending them.

 

It was by accident only that the king had not a considerable share in

those great naval discoveries, by which the present age was so much

distinguished. Columbus, after meeting with many repulses from the courts

of Portugal and Spain sent his brother Bartholomew to London, in order to

explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for the execution

of them. The king invited him over to England; but his brother, being

taken by pirates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, meanwhile,

having obtained the countenance of Isabella, was supplied with a small

fleet, and happily executed his enterprise. Henry was not discouraged by

this disappointment: he fitted out Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, settled in

Bristol, and sent him westwards in 1498, in search of new countries. Cabot

discovered the main land of America towards the sixtieth degree of

northern latitude: he sailed southwards along the coast, and discovered

Newfoundland and other countries; but returned to England without making

any conquest or settlement. Elliot and other merchants in Bristol made a

like attempt in 1502.[*] The king expended fourteen thousand pounds in

building one ship, called the Great Harry.[**] She was, properly speaking,

the first ship in the English navy. Before this period, when the prince

wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient than hiring or pressing ships

from the merchants.

 

But though this improvement of navigation, and the discovery of both the

Indies, was the most memorable incident that happened during this or any

other period, it was not the only great event by which the age was

distinguished. In 1453, Constantinople was taken by the Turks; and the

Greeks, among whom some remains of learning were still preserved, being

scattered by these barbarians, took shelter in Italy, and imported,

together with their admirable language, a tincture of their science, and

of their refined taste in poetry and eloquence About the same time, the

purity of the Latin tongue was revived, the study of antiquity became

fashionable, and the esteem for literature gradually propagated itself

throughout every nation in Europe. The art of printing, invented about

that time, extremely facilitated the progress of all these improvements:

the invention of gunpowder changed me whole art of war: mighty innovations

were soon after made in religion, such as not only affected those states

that embraced them, but even those that adhered to the ancient faith and

worship; and thus a general revolution was made in human affairs

throughout this part of the world; and men gradually attained that

situation, with regard to commerce, arts, science, government, police, and

cultivation, in which they have ever since persevered. Here, therefore,

commences the useful, as well as the more agreeable part of modern annals;

certainty has place in all the considerable, and even most of the minute

parts of historical narration; a great variety of events, preserved by

printing, give the author the power of selecting, as well as adorning, the

facts which he relates; and as each incident has a reference to our

present manners and situation, instructive lessons occur every moment

during the course of the narration. Whoever carries his anxious researches

into preceding periods, is moved by a curiosity, liberal indeed and

commendable; not by any necessity for acquiring knowledge of public

affairs, or the arts of civil government
