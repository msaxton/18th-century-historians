THE parliament which was summoned soon after the king’s accession, was

      both elected and assembled in tranquillity; and the great change, from a

      sovereign of consummate wisdom and experience to a boy of eleven years of

      age, was not immediately felt by the people. The habits of order and

      obedience which the barons had been taught, during the long reign of

      Edward, still influenced them; and the authority of the king’s three

      uncles, the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Glocester, sufficed to repress,

      for a time, the turbulent spirit to which that order, in a weak reign, was

      so often subject. The dangerous ambition, too, of these princes themselves

      was checked, by the plain and undeniable title of Richard, by the

      declaration of it made in parliament, and by the affectionate regard which

      the people bore to the memory of his father, and which was naturally

      transferred to the young sovereign upon the throne. The different

      characters, also, of these three princes rendered them a counterpoise to

      each other; and it was natural to expect, that any dangerous designs which

      might be formed by one brother, would meet with opposition from the

      others. Lancaster, whose age and experience, and authority under the late

      king, gave him the ascendant among them, though his integrity seemed not

      proof against great temptations, was neither of an enterprising spirit,

      nor of a popular and engaging temper. York was indolent, inactive, and of

      slender capacity. Glocester was turbulent, bold, and popular; but being

      the youngest of the family, was restrained by the power and authority of

      his elder brothers. There appeared, therefore, no circumstance in the

      domestic situation of England which might endanger the public peace, or

      give any immediate apprehensions to the lovers of their country.

     

      But as Edward, though he had fixed the succession to the crown, had taken

      no care to establish a plan of government during the minority of his

      grandson, it behoved the parliament to supply this defect; and the house

      of commons distinguished themselves by taking the lead on the occasion.

      This house, which had been rising to consideration during the whole course

      of the late reign, naturally received an accession of power during the

      minority; and as it was now becoming a scene of business, the members

      chose for the first time a speaker, who might preserve order in their

      debates, and maintain those forms which are requisite in all numerous

      assembles. Peter de la Mare was the man pitched on; the same person that

      had been imprisoned and detained in custody by the late king for his

      freedom of speech, in attacking the mistress and the ministers of that

      prince. But though this election discovered a spirit of liberty in the

      commons, and was followed by further attacks, both on these ministers and

      on Alice Pearce,[*] they were still too sensible of their great

      inferiority to assume at first any immediate share in the administration

      of government, or the care of the king’s person. They were content to

      apply by petition to the lords for that purpose, and desire them both to

      appoint a council of nine, who might direct the public business, and to

      choose men of virtuous life and conversation, who might inspect the

      conduct and education of the young prince. The lords complied with the

      first part of this request, and elected the bishops of London, Carlisle,

      and Salisbury, the earls of Marche and Stafford, Sir Richard de Stafford,

      Sir Henry le Scrope, Sir John Devereux, and Sir Hugh Segrave, to whom they

      gave authority for a year to conduct the ordinary course of business.[**]

      But as to the regulation of the king’s household, they declined

      interposing in an office which, they said, both was invidious in itself,

      and might prove disagreeable to his majesty.

     

      The commons, as they acquired more courage, ventured to proceed a step

      farther in their applications. They presented a petition, in which they

      prayed the king to check the prevailing custom among the barons of forming

      illegal confederacies, and supporting each other, as well as men of

      inferior rank, in the violations of law and justice. They received from

      the throne a general and an obliging answer to this petition: but another

      part of their application, that all the great officers should, during the

      king’s minority, be appointed by parliament, which seemed to require the

      concurrence of the commons, as well as that of the upper house, in the

      nomination, was not complied with: the lords alone assumed the power of

      appointing these officers. The commons tacitly acquiesced in the choice;

      and thought that, for, the present, they themselves had proceeded a

      sufficient length, if they but advanced their pretensions, though

      rejected, of interposing in these more important matters of state.

     

      On this footing then the government stood. The administration was

      conducted entirely in the king’s name: no regency was expressly appointed:

      the nine counsellors and the great officers named by the peers, did their

      duty each in his respective department; and the whole system was for some

      years kept together, by the secret authority of the king’s uncles,

      especially of the duke of Lancaster, who was in reality the regent.

     

      The parliament was dissolved, after the commons had represented the

      necessity of their being reassembled once every year, as appointed by law;

      and after having elected two citizens as their treasurers, to receive and

      disburse the produce of two fifteenths and tenths, which they had voted to

      the crown. In the other parliaments called during the minority, the

      commons still discover a strong spirit of freedom, and a sense of their

      own authority, which, without breeding any disturbance, tended to secure

      their independence and that of the people.[*] 11
 

      Edward had left his grandson involved in many dangerous wars. The

      pretensions of the duke of Lancaster to the crown of Castile, made that

      kingdom still persevere in hostilities against England. Scotland, whose

      throne was now filled by Robert Stuart, nephew to David Bruce, and the

      first prince of that family, maintained such close connections with

      France, that war with one crown almost inevitably produced hostilities

      with the other. The French monarch, whose prudent conduct had acquired him

      the surname of Wise, as he had already baffled all the experience and

      valor of the two Edwards, was likely to prove a dangerous enemy to a minor

      king: but his genius, which was not naturally enterprising, led him not at

      present to give any disturbance to his neighbors; and he labored, besides,

      under many difficulties at home, which it was necessary for him to

      surmount, before he could think of making conquests in a foreign country.

      England was master of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne; had lately acquired

      possession of Cherbourg from the cession of the king of Navarre, and of

      Brest from that of the duke of Brittany;[*] and having thus an easy

      entrance into France from every quarter, was able, even in its present

      situation, to give disturbance to his government. Before Charles could

      remove the English from these important posts, he died in the flower of

      his age, and left his kingdom to a minor son who bore the name of Charles

      VI.

     

      1378.

     

      Meanwhile the war with France was carried on in a manner somewhat languid,

      and produced no enterprise of great lustre or renown. Sir Hugh Calverly,

      governor of Calais, making an inroad into Picardy with a detachment of the

      garrison, set fire to Boulogne.[**] The duke of Lancaster conducted an

      army into Brittany, but returned without being able to perform any thing

      memorable.

     

      1380.

     

      In a subsequent year, the duke of Glocester marched out of Calais with a

      body of two thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry, and scrupled

      not, with his small army, to enter into the heart of France, and to

      continue his ravages through Picardy, Champaigne, the Brie, the Beausse,

      the Gatinois, the Orleanois, till he reached his allies in the province of

      Brittany.[***] The duke of Burgundy, at the head of a more considerable

      army, came within sight of him; but the French were so overawed by the

      former successes of the English, that no superiority of numbers could

      tempt them to venture a pitched battle with the troops of that nation. As

      the duke of Brittany, soon after the arrival of these succors, formed an

      accommodation with the court of France, this enterprise also proved in the

      issue unsuccessful, and made no durable impression upon the enemy.

     

      The expenses of these armaments, and the usual want of economy attending a

      minority, much exhausted the English treasury, and obliged the parliament,

      besides making some alterations in the council, to impose a new and

      unusual tax of three groats on every person, male and female, above

      fifteen years of age; and they ordained that, in levying that tax, the

      opulent should relieve the poor by an equitable compensation. This

      imposition produced a mutiny, which was singular in its circumstances. All

      history abounds with examples where the great tyrannize over the meaner

      sort; but here the lowest populace rose against their rulers, committed

      the most cruel ravages upon them, and took vengeance for all former

      oppressions.

     

      1381.

     

      The faint dawn of the arts and of good government in that age, had excited

      the minds of the populace, in different states of Europe, to wish for a

      better condition, and to murmur against those chains which the laws

      enacted by the haughty nobility and gentry, had so long imposed upon them.

      The commotions of the people in Flanders, the mutiny of the peasants in

      France, were the natural effects of this growing spirit of independence;

      and the report of these events being brought into England, where personal

      slavery, as we learn from Froissard,[*] was more general than in any other

      country in Europe, had prepared the minds of the multitude for an

      insurrection. One John Ball, also, a seditious preacher, who affected low

      popularity, went about the country and inculcated on his audience the

      principles of the first origin of mankind from one common stock, their

      equal right to liberty and to all the goods of nature, the tyranny of

      artificial distinctions, and the abuses which had arisen from the

      degradation of the more considerable part of the species, and the

      aggrandizement of a few insolent rulers.[**] These doctrines, so agreeable

      to the populace, and so conformable to the ideas of primitive equality

      which are engraven in the hearts of all men, were greedily received by the

      multitude, and scattered the sparks of that sedition which the present tax

      raised into a conflagration.[***]

     

      The imposition of three groats a head had been farmed out to tax-gatherers

      in each county, who levied the money on the people with rigor; and the

      clause, of making the rich ease their poorer neighbors of some share of

      the burden, being so vague and undeterminate, had doubtless occasioned

      many partialities, and made the people more sensible of the unequal lot

      which Fortune had assigned them in the distribution of her favors. The

      first disorder was raised by a blacksmith in a village of Essex. The

      tax-gatherers came to this man’s shop while he was at work, and they

      demanded payment for his daughter, whom he asserted to be below the age

      assigned by the statute. One of these fellows offered to produce a very

      indecent proof to the contrary, and at the same time laid hold of the

      maid; which the father resenting, immediately knocked out the ruffian’s

      brains with his hammer. The bystanders applauded the action, and

      exclaimed, that it was full time for the people to take vengeance on their

      tyrants, and to vindicate their native liberty. They immediately flew to

      arms: the whole neighborhood joined in the sedition: the flame spread in

      an instant over the county: it soon propagated itself into that of Kent,

      of Hertford, Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, and Lincoln.

      Before the government had the least warning of the danger, the disorder

      had grown beyond control or opposition: the populace had shaken off all

      regard to their former masters; and being headed by the most audacious and

      criminal of their associates, who assumed the feigned names of Wat Tyler,

      Jack Straw, Hob Carter, and Tom Miller, by which they were fond of

      denoting their mean origin, they committed every where the most outrageous

      violence on such of the gentry or nobility as had the misfortune to fall

      into their hands.

     

      The mutinous populace, amounting to a hundred thousand men, assembled on

      Blackheath under their leaders, Tyler and Straw; and as the princess of

      Wales, the king’s mother, returning from a pilgrimage to Canterbury,

      passed through the midst of them, they insulted her attendants, and some

      of the most insolent among them, to show their purpose of levelling all

      mankind, forced kisses from her; but they allowed her to continue her

      journey, without attempting any further injury.[*] They sent a message to

      the king, who had taken shelter in the Tower; and they desired a

      conference with him. Richard sailed down the river in a barge for that

      purpose; but on his approaching the shore, he saw such symptoms of tumult

      and insolence, that he put back and returned to that fortress.[**]

     

      The seditious peasants, meanwhile, favored by the populace of London, had

      broken into the city; had burned the duke of Lancaster’s palace of the

      Savoy; cut off the heads of all the gentlemen whom they laid hold of;

      expressed a particular animosity against the lawyers and attorneys; and

      pillaged the warehouses of the rich merchants.[*] A great body of them

      quartered themselves at Mile End; and the king, finding no defence in the

      Tower, which was weakly garrisoned and ill supplied with provisions, was

      obliged to go out to them and ask their demands. They required a general

      pardon, the abolition of slavery, freedom of commerce in market towns

      without toll or impost, and a fixed rent on lands, instead of the services

      due by villainage. These requests, which, though extremely reasonable in

      themselves, the nation was not sufficiently prepared to receive, and which

      it was dangerous to have extorted by violence, were, however, complied

      with; charters to that purpose were granted them; and this body

      immediately dispersed, and returned to their several homes.[**]

     

      During this transaction, another body of the rebels had broken into the

      Tower; had murdered Simon Sudbury, the primate and chancellor, with Sir

      Robert Hales, the treasurer, and some other persons of distinction; and

      continued their ravages in the city.[***]

      The king, passing along Smithfield, very slenderly guarded, met with Wat

      Tyler at the head of these rioters, and entered into a conference with

      him. Tyler, having ordered his companions to retire till he should give

      them a signal, after which they were to murder all the company except the

      king himself, whom they were to detain prisoner, feared not to come into

      the midst of the royal retinue. He there behaved himself in such a manner,

      that Walworth, the mayor of London, not able to bear his insolence, drew

      his sword, and struck him so violent a blow as brought him to the ground,

      where he was instantly despatched by others of the king’s attendants. The

      mutineers, seeing their leader fall, prepared themselves for revenge; and

      this whole company, with the king himself, had undoubtedly perished on the

      spot, had it not been for an extraordinary presence of mind which Richard

      discovered on the occasion. He ordered his company to stop; he advanced

      alone towards the enraged multitude, and accosting them with an affable

      and intrepid countenance, he asked them, “What is the meaning of this

      disorder my good people? Are ye angry that ye have lost your leader? I am

      your king: I will be your leader.” The populace, overawed by his presence,

      implicitly followed him. He led them into the fields, to prevent any

      disorder which might have arisen by their continuing in the city. Being

      there joined by Sir Robert Knolles, and a body of well-armed veteran

      soldiers, who had been secretly drawn together, he strictly prohibited

      that officer from falling on the rioters, and committing an

      undistinguished slaughter upon them; and he peaceably dismissed them with

      the same charters which had been granted to their fellows.[*] Soon after,

      the nobility and gentry, hearing of the king’s danger, in which they were

      all involved, flocked to London, with their adherents and retainers; and

      Richard took the field at the head of an army forty thousand strong.[**]

      It then behoved all the rebels to submit: the charters of enfranchisement

      and pardon were revoked by parliament; the low people were reduced to the

      same slavish condition as before; and several of the ringleaders were

      severely punished for the late disorders. Some were even executed without

      process or form of law.[***] It was pretended, that the intentions of the

      mutineers had been to seize the king’s person, to carry him through

      England at their head; to murder all the nobility, gentry, and lawyers,

      and even all the bishops and priests, except the mendicant friars; to

      despatch afterwards the king himself, and, having thus reduced all to a

      level, to order the kingdom at their pleasure.[****] It is not impossible

      but many of them, in the delirium of their first success, might have

      formed such projects: but of all the evils incident to human society, the

      insurrections of the populace, when not raised and supported by persons of

      higher quality, are the least to be dreaded: the mischiefs consequent to

      an abolition of all rank and distinction become so great, that they are

      immediately felt, and soon bring affairs back to their former order and

      arrangement.

     

 ENLARGE
 

      A youth of sixteen, (which was at this time the king’s age) who had

      discovered so much courage, presence of mind, and address, and had so

      dexterously eluded the violence of this tumult, raised great expectations

      in the nation; and it was natural to hope that he would, in the course of

      his life, equal the glories which had so uniformly attended his father and

      his grandfather in all their undertakings. {1385.

     

      But in proportion as Richard advanced in years, these hopes vanished; and

      his want of capacity, at least of solid judgment, appeared in every

      enterprise which he attempted. The Scots, sensible of their own deficiency

      in cavalry, had applied to the regency of Charles VI.; and John de Vienne,

      admiral of France, had been sent over with a body of one thousand five

      hundred men at arms, to support them in their incursions against the

      English. The danger was now deemed by the king’s uncles somewhat serious;

      and a numerous army of sixty thousand men was levied, and they marched

      into Scotland with Richard himself at their head. The Scots did not

      pretend to make resistance against so great a force: they abandoned

      without scruple their country to be pillaged and destroyed by the enemy:

      and when De Vienne expressed his surprise at this plan of operations, they

      told him, that all their cattle was driven into the forests and

      fastnesses; that their houses and other goods were of small value; and

      that they well knew how to compensate any losses which they might sustain

      in that respect, by making an incursion into England. Accordingly, when

      Richard entered Scotland by Berwick and the east coast, the Scots, to the

      number of thirty thousand men, attended by the French, entered the borders

      of England by the west, and carrying their ravages through Cumberland,

      Westmoreland, and Lancashire, collected a rich booty, and then returned in

      tranquillity to their own country. Richard, meanwhile, advanced towards

      Edinburgh, and destroyed in his way all the towns and villages on each

      side of him: he reduced that city to ashes: he treated in the same manner

      Perth, Dundee, and other places in the low countries; but when he was

      advised to march towards the west coast, to await there the return of the

      enemy, and to take revenge on them for their devastations, his impatience

      to return to England, and enjoy his usual pleasures and amusements,

      outweighed every consideration; and he led back his army without effecting

      any thing by all these mighty preparations. The Scots, soon after, finding

      the heavy bodies of French cavalry very useless in that desultory kind of

      war to which they confined themselves, treated their allies so ill, that

      the French returned home, much disgusted with the country and with the

      manners of its inhabitants.[*] And the English, though they regretted the

      indolence and levity of their king, saw themselves for the future secured

      against any dangerous invasion from that quarter.

     

      1386.

     

      But it was so material an interest of the French court to wrest the

      seaport towns from the hands of their enemy, that they resolved to attempt

      it by some other expedient, and found no means so likely as an invasion of

      England itself. They collected a great fleet and army at Sluise; for the

      Flemings were now in alliance with them: all the nobility of France were

      engaged in this enterprise: the English were kept in alarm: great

      preparations were made for the reception of the invaders: and though the

      dispersion of the French ships by a storm, and the taking of many of them

      by the English, before the embarkation of the troops, freed the kingdom

      from the present danger, the king and council were fully sensible that

      this perilous situation might every moment return upon them.[**]

     

      There were two circumstances, chiefly, which engaged the French at this

      time to think of such attempts. The one was the absence of the duke of

      Lancaster, who had carried into Spain the flower of the English military

      force, in prosecution of his vain claim to the crown of Castile; an

      enterprise in which, after some promising success, he was finally

      disappointed: the other was, the violent dissensions and disorders which

      had taken place in the English government.

     

      The subjection in which Richard was held by his uncles, particularly by

      the duke of Glocester, a prince of ambition and genius, though it was not

      unsuitable to his years and slender capacity, was extremely disagreeable

      to his violent temper; and he soon attempted to shake off the yoke imposed

      upon him. Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, a young man of a noble family,

      of an agreeable figure, but of dissolute manners, had acquired an entire

      ascendant over him, and governed him with an absolute authority. The king

      set so little bounds to his affection, that he first created his favorite

      marquis of Dublin, a title before unknown in England, then duke of

      Ireland; and transferred to him by patent, which was confirmed in

      parliament, the entire sovereignty for life of that island.[***]

     

      He gave him in marriage his cousin-german, the daughter of Ingelram de

      Couci, earl of Bedford; but soon after he permitted him to repudiate that

      lady, though of an unexceptionable character, and to marry a foreigner, a

      Bohemian, with whom he had become enamored.[*] These public declarations

      of attachment turned the attention of the whole court towards the minion:

      all favors passed through his hands: access to the king could only be

      obtained by his mediation: and Richard seemed to take no pleasure in royal

      authority, but so far as it enabled him to load with favors, and titles,

      and dignities, this object of his affections.

     

      The jealousy of power immediately produced an animosity Between the minion

      and his creatures on the one hand, and the princes of the blood and chief

      nobility on the other; and the usual complaints against the insolence of

      favorites were loudly echoed, and greedily received, in every part of the

      kingdom. Moubray, earl of Nottingham, the mareschal, Fitz-Alan, earl of

      Arundel, Piercy, earl of Northumberland, Montacute, earl of Salisbury,

      Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, were all connected with each other, and with

      the princes, by friendship or alliance, and still more by their common

      antipathy to those who had eclipsed them in the king’s favor and

      confidence. No longer kept in awe by the personal character of the prince,

      they scorned to submit to his ministers; and the method which they took to

      redress the grievance complained of well suited the violence of the age,

      and proves the desperate extremities to which every opposition was sure to

      be instantly carried.

     

      Michael de la Pole, the present chancellor, and lately created earl of

      Suffolk, was the son of an eminent merchant; but had risen by his

      abilities and valor during the wars of Edward III., had acquired the

      friendship of that monarch, and was esteemed the person of greatest

      experience and capacity among those who were attached to the duke of

      Ireland and the king’s secret council. The duke of Glocester, who had the

      house of commons at his devotion, impelled them to exercise that power

      which they seem first to have assumed against Lord Latimer during the

      declining years of the late king; and an impeachment against the

      chancellor was carried up by them to the house of peers, which was no less

      at his devotion. The king foresaw the tempest preparing against him and

      his ministers. After attempting in vain to rouse the Londoners to his

      defence, he withdrew from parliament, and retired with his court to

      Eltham. The parliament sent a deputation, inviting him to return, and

      threatening that, if he persisted in absenting himself, they would

      immediately dissolve, and leave the nation, though at that time in

      imminent danger of a French invasion, without any support or supply for

      its defence. At the same time, a member was encouraged to call for the

      record containing the parliamentary deposition of Edward II.; a plain

      intimation of the fate which Richard, if he continued refractory, had

      reason to expect from them. The king, finding himself unable to resist,

      was content to stipulate that, except finishing the present impeachment

      against Suffolk, no attack should be made upon any other of his ministers;

      and on that condition he returned to the parliament.[*] 12
 

      Nothing can prove more fully the innocence of Suffolk, than the

      frivolousness of the crimes which his enemies, in the present plenitude of

      their power, thought proper to object against him.[**] It was alleged,

      that being chancellor, and obliged by his oath to consult the king’s

      profit, he had purchased lands of the crown below their true value; that

      he had exchanged with the king a perpetual annuity of four hundred marks a

      year, which he inherited from his father, and which was assigned upon the

      customs of the port of Hull, for lands of an equal income; that having

      obtained for his son the priory of St. Anthony, which was formerly

      possessed by a Frenchman, an enemy and a schismatic, and a new prior being

      at the same time named by the pope, he had refused to admit this person,

      whose title was not legal, till he made a composition with his son, and

      agreed to pay him a hundred pounds a year from the income of the benefice;

      that he had purchased, from one Tydeman, of Limborch, an old and forfeited

      annuity of fifty pounds a year upon the crown, and had engaged the king to

      admit that bad debt; and that, when created earl of Suffolk, he had

      obtained a grant of five hundred pounds a year to support the dignity of

      that title.[***]

     

      We may even the proof of these articles, frivolous as they are, was found

      very deficient upon the trial: it appeared that Suffolk had made no

      purchase from the crown while he was chancellor, and that all his bargains

      of that kind were made before he was advanced to that dignity.[*] It is

      almost needless to add, that he was condemned, notwithstanding his

      defence; and that he was deprived of his office.

     

      Glocester and his associates observed their stipulation with the king, and

      attacked no more of his ministers: but they immediately attacked himself

      and his royal dignity, and framed a commission after the model of those

      which had been attempted almost in every reign since that of Richard I.,

      and which had always been attended with extreme confusion.[**] By this

      commission, which was ratified by parliament, a council of fourteen

      persons was appointed, all of Glocester’s faction, except Nevil,

      archbishop of York: the sovereign power was transferred to these men for a

      twelvemonth: the king, who had now reached the twenty-first year of his

      age, was in reality dethroned: the aristocracy was rendered supreme: and

      though the term of the commission was limited, it was easy to foresee that

      the intentions of the party were to render it perpetual, and that power

      would with great difficulty be wrested from those grasping hands to which

      it was once committed. Richard, however, was obliged to submit: he signed

      the commission which violence had extorted from him; he took an oath never

      to infringe it; and though at the end of the session he publicly entered a

      protest, that the prerogatives of the crown, notwithstanding his late

      concession, should still be deemed entire and unimpaired,[***] the new

      commissioners, without regarding this declaration, proceeded to the

      exercise of their authority.

     

      1887.

     

      The king, thus dispossessed of royal power, was soon sensible of the

      contempt into which he was fallen. His favorites and ministers, who were

      as yet allowed to remain about his person, failed not to aggravate the

      injury which without any demerit on his part, had been offered to him. And

      his eager temper was of itself sufficiently inclined to remark that the

      dukes of Glocester and York, though vastly rich received at the same time

      each of them a thousand pounds a year top support their dignity and to

      seek the means, both of recovering his authority, and of revenging himself

      on those who had invaded it. As the house of commons appeared now of

      weight in the constitution, he secretly tried some expedients for

      procuring a favorable election: he sounded some of the sheriffs, who,

      being at that time both the returning officers, and magistrates of great

      power in the counties, had naturally considerable influence in

      elections.[*] But as most of them had been appointed by his uncles, either

      during his minority or during the course of the present commission, he

      found them in general averse to his enterprise. The sentiments and

      inclinations of the judges were more favorable to him. He met at

      Nottingham Sir Robert Tresilian, chief justice of the king’s bench, Sir

      Robert Belknappe, chief justice of the common pleas, Sir John Gary, chief

      baron of the exchequer, Holt, Fulthorpe, and Bourg, inferior justices, and

      Lockton, serjeant at law; and he proposed to them some queries, which

      these lawyers, either from the influence of his authority or of reason,

      made no scruple of answering in the way he desired. They declared that the

      late commission was derogatory to the royalty and prerogative of the king;

      that those who procured it, or advised the king to consent to it, were

      punishable with death; that those who necessitated and compelled him were

      guilty of treason; that those were equally criminal who should persevere

      in maintaining it; that the king has the right of dissolving parliaments

      at pleasure; that the parliament, while it sits, must first proceed upon

      the king’s business; and that this assembly cannot without his consent

      impeach any of his ministers and judges.[**] Even according to our present

      strict maxims with regard to law and the royal prerogative, all these

      determinations, except the two last, appear justifiable: and as the great

      privileges of the commons, particularly that of impeachment, were hitherto

      new and supported by few precedents, there want not plausible reasons to

      justify these opinions of the judges.[***]

     

      They obliged the king to summon a parliament, which was entirely at their

      devotion, they had full power, by observing a few legal forms, to take

      vengeance on all their enemies. Five great peers, men whose combined power

      was able at any time to shake the throne,—the duke of Glocester, the

      king’s uncle; the earl of Derby, son of the duke of Lancaster; the earl of

      Arundel; the earl of Warwick; and the earl of Nottingham, mareschal of

      England,—entered before the parliament an accusation, or appeal, as

      it was called, against the five counsellors whom they had already accused

      before the king. The parliament, who ought to have been judges, were not

      ashamed to impose an oath on all their members, by which they bound

      themselves to live and die with the lords appellants, and to defend them

      against all opposition with their lives and fortunes.[*]

     

      The duke of Glocester and his adherents soon got intelligence of this

      secret consultation, and were naturally very much alarmed at it. They saw

      the king’s intentions; and they determined to prevent the execution of

      them. As soon as he came to London, which they knew was well disposed to

      their party, they secretly assembled their forces, and appeared in arms at

      Haringay Park, near Highgate, with a power which Richard and his ministers

      were not able to resist. They sent him a message by the archbishop of

      Canterbury, and the lords Lovel Cobham, and Devereux, and demanded that

      the persons who had seduced him by their pernicious counsel, and were

      traitors both to him and to the kingdom, should be delivered up to them. A

      few days after, they appeared in his presence, armed, and attended with

      armed followers; and they accused by name the archbishop of York, the duke

      of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, and Sir Nicholas

      Brembre, as public and dangerous enemies to the state. They threw down

      their gauntlets before the king, and fiercely offered to maintain the

      truth of their charge by duel. The persons accused, and all the other

      obnoxious ministers, had withdrawn or had concealed themselves.

     

      The duke of Ireland fled to Cheshire, and levied some forces, with which

      he advanced to relieve the king from the violence of the nobles. Glocester

      encountered him in Oxfordshire with much superior forces; routed him,

      dispersed his followers, and obliged him to fly into the Low Countries,

      where he died in exile a few years after.

     

      The other proceedings were well suited to the violence and iniquity of the

      times. A charge consisting of thirty-nine articles, was delivered in by

      the appellants; and as none of the accused counsellors, except Sir

      Nicholas Brembre, was in custody, the rest were cited to appear; and upon

      their absenting themselves, the house of peers, after a very short

      interval, without hearing a witness, without examining a fact, or

      deliberating on one point of law, declared them guilty of high treason.

      Sir Nicholas Brembre, who was produced in court, had the appearance, and

      but the appearance, of a trial: the peers, though they were not by law his

      proper judges, pronounced, in a very summary manner, sentence of death

      upon him; and he was executed, together with Sir Robert Tresilian, who had

      been discovered and taken in the interval.

     

      It would be tedious to recite the whole charge delivered in against the

      five counsellors; which is to be met with in several collections.[*]

     

      It is sufficient to observe in general, that if we reason upon the

      supposition, which is the true one, that the royal prerogative was invaded

      by the commission extorted by the duke of Glocester and his associates,

      and that the king’s person was afterwards detained in custody by rebels,

      many of the articles will appear not only to imply no crime in the duke of

      Ireland and the ministers, but to ascribe to them actions which were

      laudable, and which they were bound by their allegiance to perform. The

      few articles impeaching the conduct of these ministers before that

      commission, which subverted the constitution, and annihilated all justice

      and legal authority, are vague and general; such as their engrossing the

      king’s favor, keeping his barons at a distance from him, obtaining

      unreasonable grants for themselves or their creatures, and dissipating the

      public treasure by useless expenses. No violence is objected to them; no

      particular illegal act;[*] no breach of any statute; and their

      administration may therefore be concluded to have been so far innocent and

      inoffensive. All the disorders indeed seem to have proceeded not from any

      violation of the laws, or any ministerial tyranny, but merely from a

      rivalship of power, which the duke of Glocester and the great nobility,

      agreeably to the genius of the times, carried to the utmost extremity

      against their opponents, without any regard to reason, justice, or

      humanity.

     

      But these were not the only deeds of violence committed during the triumph

      of the party. All the other judges who had signed the extrajudicial

      opinions at Nottingham, were condemned to death, and were, as a grace or

      favor, banished to Ireland; though they pleaded the fear of their lives,

      and the menaces of the king’s ministers as their excuse. Lord Beauchamp of

      Holt, Sir James Berners, and John Salisbury, were also tried and condemned

      for high treason, merely because they had attempted to defeat the late

      commission: but the life of the latter was spared. The fate of Sir Simon

      Burley was more severe: this gentleman was much beloved for his personal

      merit, had distinguished himself by many honorable actions,[*] 13 was

      created knight of the garter, and had been appointed governor to Richard,

      by the choice of the late king and of the Black Prince: he had attended

      his master from the earliest infancy of that prince, and had ever remained

      extremely attached to him: yet all these considerations could not save him

      from falling a victim to Glocester’s vengeance.

     

      This execution, more than all the others, made a deep impression on the

      mind of Richard; his queen too (for he was already married to the sister

      of the emperor Winceslaus, King of Bohemia) interested herself in behalf

      of Burley: she remained three hours on her knees before the duke of

      Glocester, pleading for that gentleman’s life; but though she was become

      extremely popular by her amiable qualities, which had acquired her the

      appellation of “the good Queen Anne,” her petition was sternly rejected by

      the inexorable tyrant.[*]

     

      The parliament concluded this violent scene by a declaration, that none of

      the articles decided on these trials to be treason, should ever afterwards

      be drawn into precedent by the judges, who were still to consider the

      statute of the twenty-fifth of Edward as the rule of their decisions. The

      house of lords seem not at that time to have known or acknowledged the

      principle, that they themselves were bound, in their judicial capacity, to

      follow the rules which they, in conjunction with the king and commons, had

      established in their legislature.[*] 14 It was also enacted, that

      every one should swear to the perpetual maintenance and support of the

      forfeitures and attainders, and of all the other acts passed during this

      parliament. The archbishop of Canterbury added the penalty of

      excommunication, as a further security to these violent transactions.

     

      1389.

     

      It might naturally be expected, that the king, being reduced to such

      slavery by the combination of the princes and chief nobility, and having

      appeared so unable to defend his servants from the cruel effects of their

      resentment, would long remain in subjection to them; and never would

      recover the royal power, without the most violent struggles and

      convulsions: but the event proved contrary. In less than a twelvemonth,

      Richard, who was in his twenty-third year, declared in council, that, as

      he had now attained the full age which entitled him to govern by his own

      authority his kingdom and household, he resolved to exercise his right of

      sovereignty; and when no one ventured to contradict so reasonable an

      intention, he deprived Fitz-Alan, archbishop of Canterbury, of the dignity

      of chancellor, and bestowed that high office on William of Wickham, bishop

      of Winchester; the bishop of Hereford was displaced from the office of

      treasurer; the earl of Arundel from that of admiral; even the duke of

      Glocester and the earl of Warwick were removed for a time from the

      council: and no opposition was made to these great changes. The history of

      this reign is imperfect, and little to be depended on, except where it is

      supported by public records; and it is not easy for us to assign the

      reason of this unexpected event. Perhaps some secret animosities,

      naturally to be expected in that situation, had crept in among the great

      men, and had enabled the king to recover his authority. Perhaps the

      violence of their former proceedings had lost them the affections of the

      people, who soon repent of any cruel extremities to which they are carried

      by their leaders. However this may be, Richard exercised with moderation

      the authority which he had resumed. He seemed to be entirely reconciled to

      his uncles[*] and the other great men, of whom he had so much reason to

      complain: he never attempted to recall from banishment the duke of

      Ireland, whom he found so obnoxious to them: he confirmed by proclamation

      the general pardon which the parliament had passed for all offences; and

      he courted the affections of the people, by voluntarily remitting some

      subsidies which had been granted him: a remarkable, and almost singular

      instance of such generosity.

     

      After this composure of domestic differences, and this restoration of the

      government to its natural state, there passes an interval of eight years

      which affords not many remarkable events. The duke of Lancaster returned

      from Spain; having resigned to his rival all pretensions to the crown of

      Castile upon payment of a large sum of money,[**] and having married his

      daughter, Philippa, to the king of Portugal. The authority of this prince

      served to counterbalance that of the duke of Glocester, and secured the

      power of Richard, who paid great court to his eldest uncle, by whom he had

      never been offended, and whom he found more moderate in his temper than

      the younger. He made a cession to him for life of the duchy of

      Guienne,[***] which the inclinations and changeable humor of the Gascons

      had restored to the English government; but as they remonstrated loudly

      against this deed, it was finally, with the duke’s consent, revoked by

      Richard.[****]

     

      There happened an incident which produced a dissension between Lancaster

      and his two brothers. After the death of the Spanish princess, he espoused

      Catharine Swineford, daughter of a private knight of Hainault, by whose

      alliance York and Glocester thought the dignity of their family much

      injured; but the king gratified his uncle by passing in parliament a

      charter of legitimation to the children whom that lady had borne him

      before marriage, and by creating the eldest earl of Somerset.[*]

     

      The wars, meanwhile, which Richard had inherited with his crown, still

      continued; though interrupted by frequent truces, according to the

      practice of that age, and conducted with little vigor, by reason of the

      weakness of all parties. The French war was scarcely heard of; the

      tranquillity of the northern borders was only interrupted by one inroad of

      the Scots, which proceeded more from a rivalship between the two martial

      families of Piercy and Douglas, than from any national quarrel: a fierce

      battle or skirmish was fought at Otterborne,[**] in which young Piercy,

      surnamed Hotspur, from his impetuous valor, was taken prisoner, and

      Douglas slain; and the victory remained undecided.[***] Some insurrections

      of the Irish obliged the king to make an expedition into that country,

      which he reduced to obedience; and he recovered, in some degree, by this

      enterprise, his character of courage, which had suffered a little by the

      inactivity of his reign.

     

      1396.

     

      At last, the English and French courts began to think in earnest of a

      lasting peace; but found it so difficult to adjust their opposite

      pretensions, that they were content to establish a truce of twenty-five

      years: Brest and Cherbourg were restored, the former to the duke of

      Brittany, the latter to the king of Navarre: both parties were left in

      possession of all the other places which they held at the time of

      concluding the truce; and to render the amity between the two crowns more

      durable, Richard,[****] who was now a widower, was affianced to Isabella,

      the daughter of Charles. This princess was only seven years of age; but

      the king agreed to so unequal a match, chiefly that he might fortify

      himself by this alliance against the enterprises of his uncles, and the

      incurable turbulence, as well as inconstancy, of his barons.

     

      The administration of the king, though it was not in this interval sullied

      by any unpopular act, except the seizing of the charter of London,[******]

      which was soon after restored, tended not much to corroborate his

      authority; and his personal character brought him into contempt, even

      while his public government appeared in a good measure unexceptionable.

     

      Indolent, profuse, addicted to low pleasures, he spent his whole time in

      feasting and jollity, and dissipated, in idle show, or in bounties to

      favorites of no reputation, that revenue which the people expected to see

      him employ in enterprises directed to public honor and advantage. He

      forgot his rank by admitting all men to his familiarity; and he was not

      sensible, that their acquaintance with the qualities of his mind was not

      able to impress them with the respect which he neglected to preserve from

      his birth and station. The earls of Kent and Huntingdon, his half

      brothers, were his chief confidants and favorites; and though he never

      devoted himself to them with so profuse an affection as that with which he

      had formerly been attached to the duke of Ireland, it was easy for men to

      see, that every grace passed through their hands, and that the king had

      rendered himself a mere cipher in the government. The small regard which

      the public bore to his person, disposed them to murmur against his

      administration, and to receive with greedy ears every complaint which the

      discontented or ambitious grandees suggested to them.

     

      1397.

     

      Glocester soon perceived the advantages which this dissolute conduct gave

      him; and finding that both resentment and jealousy on the part of his

      nephew still prevented him from acquiring any ascendant over that prince,

      he determined to cultivate his popularity with the nation, and to revenge

      himself on those who eclipsed him in favor and authority. He seldom

      appeared at court or in council; he never declared his opinion but in

      order to disapprove of the measures embraced by the king and his

      favorites; and he courted the friendship of every man whom disappointment

      or private resentment had rendered an enemy to the administration. The

      long truce with France was unpopular with the English, who breathed

      nothing but war against that hostile nation; and Glocester took care to

      encourage all the vulgar prejudices which prevailed on this subject.

      Forgetting the misfortunes which attended the English arms during the

      later years of Edward, he made an invidious comparison between the glories

      of that reign and the inactivity of the present; and he lamented that

      Richard should have degenerated so much from the heroic virtues by which

      his father and his grandfather were distinguished. The military men were

      inflamed with a desire of war when they heard him talk of the signal

      victories formerly obtained, and of the easy prey which might be made of

      French riches by the superior valor of the English; the populace readily

      embraced the same sentiments; and all men exclaimed, that this prince,

      whose counsels were so much neglected, was the true support of English

      honor and alone able to raise the nation to its former power and splendor.

      His great abilities, his popular manners, his princely extraction, his

      immense riches, his high office of constable;[*] all these advantages, not

      a little assisted by his want of court favor, gave him a mighty authority

      in the kingdom, and rendered him formidable to Richard and his ministers.

     

      Froissard,[**] a contemporary writer, and very impartial, but whose credit

      is somewhat impaired by his want of exactness in material facts, ascribes

      to the duke of Glocester more desperate views, and such as were totally

      incompatible with the government and domestic tranquillity of the nation.

      According to that historian, he proposed to his nephew, Roger Mortimer,

      earl of Marche, whom Richard had declared his successor, to give him

      immediate possession of the throne, by the deposition of a prince so

      unworthy of power and authority: and when Mortimer declined the project,

      he resolved to make a partition of the kingdom between himself, his two

      brothers, and the earl of Arundel; and entirely to dispossess Richard of

      the crown. The king, it is said, being informed of these designs, saw that

      either his own ruin, or that of Glocester, was inevitable; and he resolved

      by a hasty blow to prevent the execution of such destructive projects.

      This is certain, that Glocester, by his own confession, had often affected

      to speak contemptuously of the king’s person and government; had

      deliberated concerning the lawfulness of throwing off allegiance to him;

      and had even borne part in a secret conference, where his deposition was

      proposed, and talked of, and determined:[***] but it is reasonable to

      think, that his schemes were not so far advanced.

     

      But whatever opinion we may form of the danger arising from Glocester’s

      conspiracies, his aversion to the French truce and alliance was public and

      avowed; and that court which had now a great influence over the king,

      pushed him to provide for his own safety, by punishing the traitorous

      designs of his uncle. The resentment against his former acts of violence

      revived; the sense of his refractory and uncompliant behavior was still

      recent; and a man whose ambition had once usurped royal authority, and who

      had murdered all the faithful servants of the king, was thought capable,

      on a favorable opportunity, of renewing the same criminal enterprises. The

      king’s precipitate temper admitted of no deliberation: he ordered

      Glocester to be unexpectedly arrested; to be hurried on board a ship which

      was lying in the river; and to be carried over to Calais, where alone, by

      reason of his numerous partisans, he could safely be detained in

      custody.[*] The earls of Arundel and Warwick were seized at the same time:

      the malecontents so suddenly deprived of their leaders, were astonished

      and overawed; and the concurrence of the dukes of Lancaster and York in

      those measures, together with the earls of Derby and Rutland, the eldest

      sons of these princes,[**] bereaved them of all possibility of resistance.

     

      A parliament was immediately summoned at Westminster; and the king doubted

      not to find the peers, and still more the commons, very compliant with his

      will. This house had in a former parliament given him very sensible proofs

      of their attachment;[***] 15 and the present suppression of Glocester’s

      party made him still more assured of a favorable election. As a further

      expedient for that purpose, he is also said to have employed the influence

      of the sheriffs; a practice which, though not unusual, gave umbrage, but

      which the established authority of that assembly rendered afterwards still

      more familiar to the nation. Accordingly, the parliament passed whatever

      acts the king was pleased to dictate to them:[****] they annulled forever

      the commission which usurped upon the royal authority, and they declared

      it treasonable to attempt, in any future period, the revival of any

      similar commission: they abrogated all the acts which attainted the king’s

      ministers, and which that parliament who passed them, and the whole nation

      had sworn inviolably to maintain: and they declared the general pardon

      then granted to be invalid, as extorted by force, and never ratified by

      the free consent of the king.

     

      Though Richard, after he resumed the government, and lay no longer under

      constraint, had voluntarily, by proclamation, confirmed that general

      indemnity, this circumstance seemed not, in their eyes, to merit any

      consideration. Even a particular pardon, granted six years after to the

      earl of Arundel, was annulled by parliament, on pretence that it had been

      procured by surprise, and that the king was not then fully apprized of the

      degree of guilt incurred by that nobleman.

     

      The commons then preferred an impeachment against Fitz-Alan, archbishop of

      Canterbury, and brother to Arundel, and accused him for his concurrence in

      procuring the illegal commission, and in attainting the king’s ministers.

      The primate pleaded guilty; but as he was protected by the ecclesiastical

      privileges, the king was satisfied with a sentence which banished him the

      kingdom, and sequestered his temporalities.[*] An appeal or accusation was

      presented against the duke of Glocester, and the earls of Arundel and

      Warwick, by the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntingdon, Somerset, Salisbury,

      and Nottingham, together with the lords Spenser and Scrope, and they were

      accused of the same crimes which had been imputed to the archbishop, as

      well as of their appearance against the king in a hostile manner at

      Haringay Park. The earl of Arundel, who was brought to the bar, wisely

      confined all his defence to the pleading of both the general and

      particular pardon of the king; but his plea being overruled, he was

      condemned and executed.[**]

     

      The earl of Warwick, who was also convicted of high treason, was, on

      account of his submissive behavior, pardoned as to his life, but doomed to

      perpetual banishment in the Isle of Man. No new acts of treason were

      imputed to either of these noblemen. The only crimes for which they were

      condemned, were the old attempts against the crown, which seemed to be

      obliterated both by the distance of time and by repeated pardons.[*] The

      reasons of this method of proceeding it is difficult to conjecture. The

      recent conspiracies of Glocester seem certain from his own confession; but

      perhaps the king and ministry had not at that time in their hands any

      satisfactory proof of their reality; perhaps it was difficult to convict

      Arundel and Warwick of any participation in them; perhaps an inquiry into

      these conspiracies would have involved in the guilt some of those great

      noblemen who now concurred with the crown, and whom it was necessary to

      cover from all imputation; or perhaps the king, according to the genius of

      the age, was indifferent about maintaining even the appearance of law and

      equity, and was only solicitous by any means to insure success in these

      prosecutions. This point, like many others in ancient history, we are

      obliged to leave altogether undetermined.

     

      A warrant was issued to the earl mareschal, governor of Calais, to bring

      over the duke of Glocester, in order to his trial; but the governor

      returned for answer, that the duke had died suddenly of an apoplexy in

      that fortress. Nothing could be more suspicious, from the time, than the

      circumstances of that prince’s death: it became immediately the general

      opinion, that he was murdered by orders from his nephew: in the subsequent

      reign, undoubted proofs were produced in parliament, that he had been

      suffocated with pillows by his keepers:[**] and it appeared that the king,

      apprehensive lest the public trial and execution of so popular a prince,

      and so near a relation, might prove both dangerous and invidious, had

      taken this base method of gratifying, and, as he fancied, concealing, his

      revenge upon him. Both parties, in their successive triumphs, seem to have

      had no further concern than that of retaliating upon their adversaries;

      and neither of them were aware that, by imitating, they indirectly

      justified, as far as it lay in their power, all the illegal violence of

      the opposite party.

     

      This session concluded with the creation or advancement of several peers:

      the earl of Derby was made duke of Hereford; the earl of Rutland, duke of

      Albemarle; the earl of Kent, duke of Surrey; the earl of Huntingdon, duke

      of Exeter; the earl of Nottingham, duke of Norfolk; the earl of Somerset,

      marquis of Dorset; Lord Spenser, earl of Glocester; Rulph Nevil, earl of

      Westmoreland; Thomas Piercy, earl of Worcester; William Scrope, earl of

      Wiltshire.[*] The parliament, after a session of twelve days, was

      adjourned to Shrewsbury. The king, before the departure of the members,

      exacted from them an oath for the perpetual maintenance and establishment

      of all their acts; an oath similar to that which had formerly been

      required by the duke of Glocester and his party, and which had already

      proved so vain and fruitless.

     

      1398.

     

      Both king and parliament met in the same dispositions at Shrewsbury. So

      anxious was Richard for the security of these acts, that he obliged the

      lords and commons to swear anew to them on the cross of Canterbury;[**]

      and he soon after procured a bull from the pope, by which they were, as he

      imagined, perpetually secured and established.[***] The parliament, on the

      other hand, conferred on him for life the duties on wool, wool-fells, and

      leather, and granted him, besides, a subsidy of one tenth and a half, and

      one fifteenth and a half. They also reversed the attainder of Tresilian

      and the other judges; and, with the approbation of the present judges,

      declared the answers for which these magistrates had been impeached to be

      just and legal:[****] and they carried so far their retrospect as to

      reverse, on the petition of Lord Spenser, earl of Glocester, the attainder

      pronounced against the two Spensers in the reign of Edward II.[*****] The

      ancient history of England is nothing but a catalogue of reversals: every

      thing is in fluctuation and movement: one faction is continually undoing

      what was established by another: and the multiplied oaths which each party

      exacted for the security of the present acts, betray a perpetual

      consciousness of their instability.

     

      The parliament, before they were dissolved, elected a committee of twelve

      lords and six commoners,[******] whom they invested with the whole power

      both of lords and commons, and endowed with full authority to finish all

      business which had been laid before the houses, and which they had not had

      leisure to bring to a conclusion.[*******]

     

      This was an unusual concession; and though it was limited in the object,

      might, either immediately or as a precedent, have proved dangerous to the

      constitution; but the cause of that extraordinary measure was an event

      singular and unexpected, which engaged the attention of the parliament.

     

      After the destruction of the duke of Glocester and the heads of that

      party, a misunderstanding broke out among those noblemen who had joined in

      the prosecution; and the king wanted either authority sufficient to

      appease it, or foresight to prevent it. The duke of Hereford appeared in

      parliament, and accused the duke of Norfolk of having spoken to him, in

      private, many slanderous words of the king, and of having imputed to that

      prince an intention of subverting and destroying many of his principal

      nobility.[**] Norfolk.. denied the charge, gave Hereford the lie, and

      offered to prove his own innocence by duel. The challenge was accepted:

      the time and place of combat were appointed: and as the event of this

      important trial by arms might require the interposition of legislative

      authority, the parliament thought it more suitable to delegate their power

      to a committee, than to prolong the session beyond the usual time which

      custom and general convenience had prescribed to it.[***]

     

      The duke of Hereford was certainly very little delicate in the point of

      honor, when he revealed a private conversation to the ruin of the person

      who had intrusted him; and we may thence be more inclined to believe the

      duke of Norfolk’s denial, than the other’s asseveration. But Norfolk had

      in these transactions betrayed an equal neglect of honor, which brings him

      entirely on a level with his antagonist. Though he had publicly joined

      with the duke of Glocester and his party in all the former acts of

      violence against the king.

     

      The lists for this decision of truth and right were appointed at Coventry

      before the king: all the nobility of England banded into parties, and

      adhered either to the one duke or the other: the whole nation was held in

      suspense with regard to the event; but when the two champions appeared in

      the field accoutred for the combat, the king interposed, to prevent both

      the present effusion of such noble blood, and the future consequences of

      the quarrel. By the advice and authority of the parliamentary

      commissioners, he stopped the duel; and to show his impartiality, he

      ordered, by the same authority both the combatants to leave the

      kingdom;[*] assigning one country for the place of Norfolk’s exile, which

      he declared perpetual, another for that of Hereford, which he limited to

      ten years.

     

      Hereford was a man of great prudence and command of temper; and he behaved

      himself with so much submission in these delicate circumstances, that the

      king, before his departure, promised to shorten the term of his exile four

      years; and he also granted him letters patent, by which he was empowered,

      in case any inheritance should in the interval accrue to him, to enter

      immediately in possession, and to postpone the doing of homage till his

      return.

     

      The weakness and fluctuation of Richard’s counsels appear nowhere more

      evident than in the conduct of this affair. No sooner had Hereford left

      the kingdom, than the king’s jealousy of the power and riches of that

      prince’s family revived; and he was sensible that by Glocester’s death he

      had only removed a counterpoise to the Lancastrian interest which was now

      become formidable to his crown and kingdom. Being informed that Hereford

      had entered into a treaty of marriage with the daughter of the duke of

      Berry, uncle to the French king, he determined to prevent the finishing of

      an alliance which would so much extend the interest of his cousin in

      foreign countries; and he sent over the earl of Salisbury to Paris with a

      commission for that purpose.

     

      1399.

     

      The death of the duke of Lancaster, which happened soon after, called upon

      him to take new resolutions with regard to that opulent succession. The

      present duke, in consequence of the king’s patent, desired to be put in

      possession of the estate and jurisdictions of his father; but Richard,

      afraid of strengthening the hands of a man whom he had already so much

      offended, applied to the parliamentary commissioners, and persuaded them

      that this affair was but an appendage to that business which the

      parliament had delegated to them. By their authority he revoked his

      letters patent, and retained possession of the estate of Lancaster; and by

      the same authority he seized and tried the duke’s attorney, who had

      procured and insisted on the letters, and he had him condemned as a

      traitor for faithfully executing that trust to his master;[*] an

      extravagant act of power! even though the king changed, in favor of the

      attorney, the penalty of death into that of banishment.

     

      Henry, the new duke of Lancaster, had acquired by his conduct and

      abilities the esteem of the public; and having served with distinction

      against the infidels in Lithuania, he had joined to his other praises

      those of piety and valor, virtues which have at all times a great

      influence over mankind, and were, during those ages, the qualities chiefly

      held in estimation.[**] He was connected with most of the principal

      nobility by blood, alliance, or friendship; and as the injury done him by

      the king might in its consequences affect all of them, he easily brought

      them, by a sense of common interest, to take part in his resentment. The

      people, who must have an object of affection, who found nothing in the

      king’s person which they could love or revere, and who were even disgusted

      with many parts of his conduct[***] easily transferred to Henry that

      attachment which the death of the duke of Glocester had left.

     

      While such were the dispositions of the people, Richard had the imprudence

      to embark for Ireland, in order to revenge the death of his cousin, Roger,

      earl of Marche, the presumptive heir of the crown, who had lately been

      slain in a skirmish by the natives; and he thereby left the kingdom of

      England open to the attempts of his provoked and ambitious enemy. Henry,

      embarking at Nantz with a retinue of sixty persons, among whom were the

      archbishop of Canterbury and the young earl of Arundel, nephew to that

      prelate, landed at Ravenspur, in Yorkshire; and was immediately joined by

      the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, two of the most potent

      barons in England. He here took a solemn oath, that he had no other

      purpose hi this invasion than to recover the duchy of Lancaster, unjustly

      detained from him; and he invited all his friends in England, and all

      lovers of their country, to second him in this reasonable and moderate

      pretension. Every place was in commotion: the malecontents in all quarters

      flew to arms: London discovered the strongest symptoms of its disposition

      to mutiny and rebellion: and Henry’s army, increasing on every day’s

      march, soon amounted to the number of sixty thousand combatants.

     

      The duke of York was left guardian of the realm; a place to which his

      birth entitled him, but which both his slender abilities, and his natural

      connections with the duke of Lancaster, rendered him utterly incapable of

      filling in such a dangerous emergency. Such of the chief nobility as were

      attached to the crown, and could either have seconded the guardian’s good

      intentions, or have overawed his infidelity, had attended the king into

      Ireland; and the efforts of Richard’s friends were every where more feeble

      than those of his enemies. The duke of York, however, appointed the

      rendezvous of his forces at St. Albans, and soon assembled an army of

      forty thousand men; but found them entirely destitute of zeal and

      attachment to the royal cause, and more inclined to join the party of the

      rebels. He hearkened therefore very readily to a message from Henry, who

      entreated him not to oppose a loyal and humble supplicant in the recovery

      of his legal patrimony; and the guardian even declared publicly that he

      would second his nephew in so reasonable a request. His army embraced with

      acclamations the same measures; and the duke of Lancaster, reenforced by

      them, was now entirely master of the kingdom. He hastened to Bristol, into

      which some of the king’s ministers had thrown themselves; and soon

      obliging that place to surrender, he yielded to the popular wishes, and

      without giving them a trial, ordered the earl of Wiltshire, Sir John

      Bussy, and Sir Henry Green, whom he there took prisoners, to be led to

      immediate execution.

     

      The king, receiving intelligence of this invasion and insurrection,

      hastened over from Ireland, and landed in Milford Haven with a body of

      twenty thousand men: but even this army, so much inferior to the enemy,

      was either overawed oy the general combination of the kingdom, or seized

      with the same spirit of disaffection; and they gradually deserted him,

      till he found that he had not above six thousand men who followed his

      standard. It appeared, therefore, necessary to retire secretly from this

      small body, which served only to expose him to danger; and he fled to the

      Isle of Anglesea, where he purposed to embark either for Ireland or

      France, and there await the favorable opportunities which the return of

      his subjects to a sense of duty, or their future discontents against the

      duke of Lancaster, would probably afford him. Henry, sensible of the

      danger, sent to him the earl of Northumberland, with the strongest

      professions of loyalty and submission; and that nobleman, by treachery and

      false oaths, made himself master of the king’s person, and carried him to

      his enemy at Flint Castle. Richard was conducted to London by the duke of

      Lancaster, who was there received with the acclamations of the mutinous

      populace. It is pretended that the recorder met him on the road, and in

      the name of the city entreated him, for the public safety, to put Richard

      to death, with all his adherents who were prisoners; but the duke

      prudently determined to make many others participate in his guilt, before

      he would proceed to these extremities. For this purpose he issued writs of

      election in the king’s name, and appointed the immediate meeting of a

      parliament at Westminster.

     

      Such of the peers as were most devoted to the king, were either fled or

      imprisoned; and no opponents, even among the barons, dared to appear

      against Henry, amidst that scene of outrage and violence which commonly

      attends revolutions, especially in England during those turbulent ages, It

      is also easy to imagine, that a house of commons, elected during this

      universal ferment, and this triumph of the Lancastrian party, would be

      extremely attached to that cause, and ready to second every suggestion of

      their leaders. That order, being an yet of too little weight to stem the

      torrent, was always carried along with it, and served only to increase the

      violence which the public interest required it should endeavor to control.

      The duke of Lancaster, therefore, sensible that he should be entirely

      master, began to carry his views to the crown itself; and he deliberated

      with his partisans concerning the most proper means of effecting his

      daring purpose. He first extorted a resignation from Richard;[*] but as he

      knew that this deed would plainly appear the result of force and fear, he

      also purposed, notwithstanding the danger of the precedent to himself and

      his posterity, to have him solemnly deposed in parliament for his

      pretended tyranny and misconduct. A charge, consisting of thirty-three

      articles, was accordingly drawn up against him, and presented to that

      assembly.[**]

     

      If we examine these articles, which are expressed with extreme acrimony

      against Richard, we shall find that, except some rash speeches, which are

      imputed to him,[***] and of whose reality, as they are said to have passed

      in private conversation, we may reasonably entertain some doubt,—the

      chief amount of the charge is contained in his violent conduct during the

      two last years of his reign, and naturally divides itself into two

      principal heads. The first and most considerable is the revenge which he

      took on the princes and great barons who had formerly usurped, and still

      persevered in controlling and threatening his authority; the second is the

      violation of the laws and general privileges of his people. But the

      former, however irregular in many of its circumstances, was fully

      supported by authority of parliament, and was but a copy of the violence

      which the princes and barons themselves, during their former triumph, had

      exercised against him and his party. The detention of Lancaster’s estate

      was, properly speaking a revocation, by parliamentary authority, of a

      grace which the King himself had formerly granted him. The murder of

      Glocester (for the secret execution, however merited, of that prince

      certainly deserves this appellation) was a private deed formed not any

      precedent, and implied not any usurped or arbitrary power of the crown

      which could justly give umbrage to the people. It really proceeded from a

      defect of power in the king, rather than from his ambition; and proves

      that, instead of being dangerous to the constitution, he possessed not

      even the authority necessary for the execution of the laws.

     

      Concerning the second head of accusation, as it mostly consists of general

      facts, was framed by Richard’s inveterate enemies, and was never allowed

      to be answered by him or his friends, it is more difficult to form a

      judgment. The greatest part of these grievances imputed to Richard, seems

      to be the exertion of arbitrary prerogatives; such as the dispensing

      power,[*] levying purveyance,[**] employing the mareschal’s court,[***]

      extorting loans,[****] granting protections from lawsuits;[*****]

      prerogatives, which, though often complained of, had often been exercised

      by his predecessors, and still continued to be so by his successors. But

      whether his irregular acts of this kind were more frequent, and

      injudicious and violent than usual, or were only laid hold of and

      exaggerated by the factions to which the weakness of his reign had given

      birth, we are not able at this distance to determine with certainty. There

      is, however, one circumstance in which his conduct is visibly different

      from that of his grandfather: he is not accused of having imposed one

      arbitrary tax, without consent of parliament, during his whole

      reign;[******] scarcely a year passed during the reign of Edward, which

      was free from complaints with regard to this dangerous exertion of

      authority. But, perhaps, the ascendant which Edward had acquired over the

      people, together with his great prudence, enabled him to make a use very

      advantageous to his subjects of this and other arbitrary prerogatives, and

      rendered them a smaller grievance in his hands, than a less absolute

      authority in those of his grand son.

     

      This is a point which it would be rash for us to decide positively on

      either side; but it is certain, that a charge drawn up by the duke of

      Lancaster, and assented to by a parliament, situated in those

      circumstances, forms no manner of presumption with regard to the unusual

      irregularity or violence of the king’s conduct in this particular.[*] 16
 

      When the charge against Richard was presented to the parliament, though it

      was liable, almost in every article, to objections, it was not canvassed,

      nor examined, nor disputed in either house, and seemed to be received with

      universal approbation. One man alone, the bishop of Carlisle, had the

      courage, amidst this general disloyalty and violence, to appear in defence

      of his unhappy master, and to plead his cause against all the power of the

      prevailing party. Though some topics employed by that virtuous prelate may

      seem to favor too much the doctrine of passive obedience, and to make too

      large a sacrifice of the rights of mankind, he was naturally pushed into

      that extreme by his abhorrence of the present licentious factions; and

      such intrepidity, as well as disinterestedness of behavior, proves that,

      whatever his speculative principles were his heart was elevated far above

      the meanness and abject submission of a slave. He represented to the

      parliament, that all the abuses of government which could justly be

      imputed to Richard, instead of amounting to tyranny, were merely the

      result of error, youth, or misguided counsel, and admitted of a remedy

      more easy and salutary than a total subversion of the constitution. That

      even had they been much more violent and dangerous than they really were,

      they had chiefly proceeded from former examples of resistance, which,

      making the prince sensible of his precarious situation, had obliged him to

      establish his throne by irregular and arbitrary expedients. That a

      rebellious disposition in subjects was the principal cause of tyranny in

      kings; laws could never secure the subject, which did not give security to

      the sovereign; and if the maxim of inviolable loyalty, which formed the

      basis of the English government, were once rejected, the privileges

      belonging to the several orders of the state, instead of being fortified

      by that licentiousness, would thereby lose the surest foundation of their

      force and stability. That the parliamentary deposition of Edward II., far

      from making a precedent which could control this maxim, was only an

      example of successful violence; and it was sufficiently to be lamented,

      that crimes were so often committed in the world, without establishing

      principles which might justify and authorize them.

     

      That even that precedent, false and dangerous as it was, could never

      warrant the present excesses; which were so much greater, and which would

      entail distraction and misery on the nation, to the latest posterity. That

      the succession, at least, of the crown, was then preserved inviolate: the

      lineal heir was placed on the throne; and the people had an opportunity,

      by their legal obedience to him, of making atonement for the violence

      which they had committed against his predecessor. That a descendant of

      Lionel, duke of Clarence, the elder brother of the late duke of Lancaster,

      had been declared in parliament successor to the crown; he had left

      posterity; and their title, however it might be overpowered by present

      force and faction, could never be obliterated from the minds of the

      people. That if the turbulent disposition alone of the nation had

      overturned the well-established throne of so good a prince as Richard,

      what bloody commotions must ensue, when the same cause was united to the

      motive of restoring the legal and undoubted heir to his authority? That

      the new government intended to be established, would stand on no

      principle; and would scarcely retain any pretence by which it could

      challenge the obedience of men of sense and virtue. That the claim of

      lineal descent was so gross, as scarcely to deceive the most ignorant of

      the populace: conquest could never be pleaded by a rebel against his

      sovereign; the consent of the people had no authority in a monarchy not

      derived from consent, but established by hereditary right; and however the

      nation might be justified in deposing the misguided Richard, it could

      never have any reason for setting aside his lawful heir and successor, who

      was plainly innocent. And that the duke of Lancaster would give them but a

      bad specimen of the legal moderation which might be expected from his

      future government, if he added,[**typo?] to the crime of his past

      rebellion, the guilt of excluding the family, which, both by right of

      blood and by declaration of parliament, would, in case of Richard’s demise

      or voluntary resignation, have been received as the undoubted heirs of the

      monarchy.[*]

     

      All the circumstances of this event, compared to those which attended the

      late revolution in 1688, show the difference between a great and civilized

      nation, deliberately vindicating its established privileges, and a

      turbulent and barbarous aristocracy, plunging headlong from the extremes

      of one faction into those of another. This noble freedom of the bishop of

      Carlisle, instead of being applauded, was not so much as tolerated: he was

      immediately arrested by order of the duke of Lancaster, and sent a

      prisoner to the abbey of St. Albans. No further debate was attempted:

      thirty-three long articles of charge were, in one meeting, voted against

      Richard; and voted unanimously by the same peers and prelates who, a

      little before, had voluntarily and unanimously authorized those very acts

      of violence of which they now complained. That prince was deposed by the

      suffrages of both houses; and the throne being now vacant, the duke of

      Lancaster stepped forth, and having crossed himself on the forehead and on

      the breast, and called upon the name of Christ,[*] he pronounced these

      words, which we shall give in the original language, because of their

      singularity.

     

      “In the name of Fadher, Son, and Holy Ghost, I Henry of Lancaster,

      challenge this rewme of Ynglande, and the croun with all the membres, and

      the appurtenances; als I that am descendit by right line of the blode,

      coming fro the gude king Henry therde, and throge that right that God of

      his grace hath sent me, with helpe of kyn, and of my frendes to recover

      it; the which rewme was in poynt to be ondone by defaut of governance, and

      ondoying of the gude lawes.”[**]

     

      In order to understand this speech, it must be observed, that there was a

      silly story, received among some of the lowest vulgar, that Edmond, earl

      of Lancaster, son of Henry III., was really the elder brother of Edward

      I.; but that, by reason of some deformity in his person, he had been

      postponed in the succession, and his younger brother imposed on the nation

      in his stead. As the present duke of Lancaster inherited from Edmond by

      his mother, this genealogy made him the true heir of the monarchy, and it

      is therefore insinuated in Henry’s speech: but the absurdity was too gross

      to be openly avowed either by him or by the parliament. The case is the

      same with regard to his right of conquest: he was a subject who rebelled

      against his sovereign: he entered the kingdom with a retinue of no more

      than sixty persons.

     

      The subsequent events discover the same headlong violence of conduct, and

      the same rude notions of civil government. The deposition of Richard

      dissolved the parliament: it was necessary to summon a new one: and Henry,

      in six days after, called together, without any new election, the same

      members; and this assembly he denominated a new parliament. They were

      employed in the usual task of reversing every deed of the opposite party.

      All the acts oÂ£ the last parliament of Richard, which had been confirmed

      by their oaths, and by a papal bull, were abrogated: all the acts which

      had passed in the parliament where Glocester prevailed: which had also

      been confirmed by their oaths, but which had been abrogated by Richard,

      were anew established:[**] the answers of Tresifian and the other judges,

      which a parliament had annulled, but which a new parliament and new judges

      had approved, here received a second condemnation.

     

      The peers who had accused Glocester, Arundel, and Warwick, and who had

      received higher titles for that piece of service, were all of them

      degraded from their new dignities; even the practice of prosecuting

      appeals in parliament, which bore the air of a violent confederacy against

      an individual, rather than of a legal indictment, was wholly abolished,

      and trials were restored to the course of common law.* The natural effect

      of this conduct was, to render the people giddy with such rapid and

      perpetual changes, and to make them lose all notions of right and wrong in

      the measures of government.

     

      The earl of Northumberland made a motion, in the house of peers, with

      regard to the unhappy prince whom they had deposed. He asked them, what

      advice they would give the king for the future treatment of him; since

      Henry was resolved to spare his life. They unanimously replied, that he

      should be imprisoned under a secure guard, in some secret place, and

      should be deprived of all commerce with any of his friends or partisans.

      It was easy to foresee, that he would not long remain alive in the hands

      of such barbarous and sanguinary enemies. Historians differ with regard to

      the manner in which he was murdered. It was long the prevailing opinion,

      that Sir Piers Exton, and others of his guards, fell upon him in the

      Castle of Pomfret, where he was confined, and despatched him with their

      halberts. But it is more probable that he was starved to death in prison;

      and after all sustenance was denied him, he prolonged his unhappy life, it

      is said, for a fortnight, before he reached the end of his miseries. This

      account is more consistent with the story, that his body was exposed in

      public, and that no marks of violence were observed upon it. He died in

      the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign. He

      left no posterity, either legitimate or illegitimate.

     

      All the writers who have transmitted to us the history of Richard, lived

      during the reigns of the Lancastrian princes, and candor requires, that we

      should not give entire credit to the reproaches which they have thrown

      upon his memory. But after making all proper allowances, he still appears

      to have been a weak prince, and unfit for government, less for want of

      natural parts and capacity, than of solid judgment and a good education.

      He was violent in his temper, profuse in his expenses, fond of idle show

      and magnificence, devoted to favorites, and addicted to pleasure;

      passions, all of them the most inconsistent with a prudent economy, and

      consequently dangerous in a limited and mixed government. Had he possessed

      the talents of gaining, and still more those of overawing, his great

      barons, he might have escaped all the misfortunes of his reign, and been

      allowed to carry much further his oppressions over the people, if he

      really was guilty of any, without their daring to rebel, or even to murmur

      against him. But when the grandees were tempted, by his want of prudence

      and of vigor, to resist his authority, and execute the most violent

      enterprises upon him, he was naturally led to seek an opportunity of

      retaliation: justice was neglected; the lives of the chief nobility were

      sacrificed; and all these enormities seem to have proceeded less from a

      settled design of establishing arbitrary power, than from the insolence of

      victory, and the necessities of the king’s situation. The manners indeed

      of the age were the chief source of such violence: laws, which were feebly

      executed in peaceable times, lost all their authority during public

      convulsions: both parties were alike guilty: or, if any difference may be

      remarked between them, we shall find, that the authority of the crown,

      being more legal, was commonly carried, when it prevailed, to less

      desperate extremities, than was that of the aristocracy.

     

      On comparing the conduct and events of this reign with those of the

      preceding, we shall find equal reason to admire Edward and to blame

      Richard; but the circumstance of opposition, surely, will not lie in the

      strict regard paid by the former to national privileges, and the neglect

      of them by the latter. On the contrary, the prince of small abilities, as

      he felt his want of power, seems to have been more moderate in this

      respect than the other. Every parliament assembled during the reign of

      Edward, remonstrates against the exertion of some arbitrary prerogative or

      other: we hear not any complaints of that kind during the reign of

      Richard, till the assembling of his last parliament, which was summoned by

      his inveterate enemies, which dethroned him, which framed their complaints

      during the time of the most furious convultions, and whose testimony must

      therefore have, on that account, much less authority with every equitable

      judge.[*] Both these princes experienced the encroachments of the great

      upon their authority. Edward, reduced to necessities, was obliged to make

      an express bargain with his parliament and to sell some of his

      prerogatives for present supply; but as they were acquainted with his

      genius and capacity, they ventured not to demand any exorbitant

      concessions, or such as were incompatible with regal and sovereign power:

      the weakness of Richard tempted the parliament to extort a commission,

      which, in a manner, dethroned the prince, and transferred the sceptre into

      the hands of the nobility. The events of these encroachments were also

      suitable to the character of each. Edward had no sooner gotten the supply,

      than he departed from the engagements which had induced the parliament to

      grant it; he openly told his people, that he had but dissembled with them

      when he seemed to make them these concessions; and he resumed and retained

      all his prerogatives. But Richard, because he was detected in consulting

      and deliberating with the judges on the lawfulness of restoring the

      constitution, found his barons immediately in arms against him; was

      deprived of his liberty; saw his favorites, his ministers, his tutor,

      butchered before his face, or banished and attainted; and was obliged to

      give way to all this violence. There cannot be a more remarkable contrast

      between the fortunes of two princes: it were happy for society, did this

      contrast always depend on the justice or injustice of the measures which

      men embrace; and not rather on the different degrees of prudence and vigor

      with which those measures are supported.

     

      There was a sensible decay of ecclesiastical authority during this period.

      The disgust which the laity had received from the numerous usurpations

      both of the court of Rome and of their own clergy, had very much weaned

      the kingdom from superstition; and strong symptoms appeared, from time to

      time, of a general desire to shake off the bondage of the Romish church.

      In the committee of eighteen, to whom Richard’s last parliament delegated

      their whole power, there is not the name of one ecclesiastic to be found;

      a neglect which is almost without example, while the Catholic religion

      subsisted in England.[**] 17
 

      The aversion entertained against the established church soon found

      principles, and tenets, and reasonings, by which it could justify and

      support itself. John Wickliffe, a secular priest, educated at Oxford,

      began in the latter end of Edward III. to spread the doctrine of

      reformation by his discourses, sermons, and writings; and he made many

      disciples among men of all ranks and stations. He seems to have been a man

      of parts and learning; and has the honor of being the first person in

      Europe that publicly called in question those principles which had

      universally passed for certain and undisputed during so many ages.

      Wickliffe himself, as well as his disciples, who received the name of

      Wickliffites, or Lollards, was distinguished by a great austerity of life

      and manners; a circumstance common to almost all those who dogmatize in

      any new way; both because men who draw to them the attention of the

      public, and expose themselves to the odium of great multitudes, are

      obliged to be very guarded in their conduct, and because few who have a

      strong propensity to pleasure or business, will enter upon so difficult

      and laborious an undertaking. The doctrines of Wickliffe being derived

      from his search into the Scriptures and into ecclesiastical antiquity,

      were nearly the same with those which were propagated by the reformers in

      the sixteenth century: he only carried some of them farther than was done

      by the more sober part of these reformers. He denied the doctrine of the

      real presence, the supremacy of the church of Rome, the merit of monastic

      vows: he maintained, that the Scriptures were the sole rule of faith; that

      the church was dependent on the state, and should be reformed by it; that

      the clergy ought to possess no estates; that the begging friars were a

      nuisance, and ought not to be supported;[*] that the numerous ceremonies

      of the church were hurtful to true piety: he asserted that oaths were

      unlawful, that dominion was founded in grace, that everything was subject

      to fate and destiny, and that all men were preordained either to eternal

      salvation or reprobation,[**] From the whole of his doctrines, Wickliffe

      appears to have been strongly tinctured with enthusiasm, and to have been

      thereby the better qualified to oppose a church whose chief characteristic

      is superstition.

     

      The propagation of these principles gave great alarm to the clergy; and a

      bull was issued by Pope Gregory XI. for taking Wickliffe into custody, and

      examining into the scope of his opinions.[*] Courteney, bishop of London,

      cited him before his tribunal; but the reformer had now acquired powerful

      protectors, who screened him from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The

      duke of Lancaster, who then governed the kingdom, encouraged the

      principles of Wickliffe; and he made no scruple, as well as Lord Piercy,

      the mareschal, to appear openly in court with him, in order to give him

      countenance upon his trial: he even insisted, that Wickliffe should sit in

      the bishop’s presence while his principles were examined: Courteney

      exclaimed against the insult: the Londoners, thinking their prelate

      affronted, attacked the duke and mareschal, who escaped from their hands

      with some difficulty.[**] And the populace, soon after, broke into the

      houses of both these noblemen, threatened their persons, and plundered

      their goods. The bishop of London had the merit of appeasing their fury

      and resentment.

     

      The duke of Lancaster, however, still continued his protection to

      Wickliffe, during the minority of Richard; and the principles of that

      reformer had so far propagated themselves, that when the pope sent to

      Oxford a new bull against these doctrines, the university deliberated for

      some time whether they should receive the bull; and they never took any

      vigorous measures in consequence of the papal orders.[***] Even the

      populace of London were at length brought to entertain favorable

      sentiments of this reformer: when he was cited before a synod at Lambeth,

      they broke into the assembly, and so overawed the prelates, who found both

      the people and the court against them, that they dismissed him without any

      further censure.

     

      The clergy, we may well believe, were more wanting in power than in

      inclination to punish this new heresy which struck at all their credit,

      possessions, and authority. But there was hitherto no law in England by

      which the secular arm was authorized to support orthodoxy; and the

      ecclesiastics endeavored to supply the defect by an extraordinary and

      unwarrantable artifice. In the year 1381, there was an act passed,

      requiring sheriffs to apprehend the preachers of heresy and their

      abettors; but this statute had been surreptitiously obtained by the

      clergy, and had the formality of an enrolment without the consent of the

      commons. In the subsequent session, the lower house complained of the

      fraud; affirmed, that they had no intention to bind themselves to the

      prelates further than their ancestors had done before them; and required

      that the pretended statute should be repealed, which was done

      accordingly.* But it is remarkable, that notwithstanding this vigilance of

      the commons, the clergy had so much art and influence, that the repeal was

      suppressed, and the act, which never had any legal authority, remains to

      this day upon the statute book;[*] though the clergy still thought proper

      to keep it in reserve and not proceed to the immediate execution of it.

     

      But besides this defect of power in the church, which saved Wickliffe,

      that reformer himself, notwithstanding his enthusiasm, seems not to have

      been actuated by the spirit of martyrdom; and in all subsequent trials

      before the prelates, he so explained away his doctrine by tortured

      meanings, as to render it quite innocent and inoffensive.[**] Most of his

      followers imitated his cautious disposition, and saved themselves either

      by recantations or explanations. He died of a palsy, in the year 1385, at

      his rectory of Lutterworth, in the county of Leicester; and the clergy,

      mortified that he should have escaped their vengeance, took care, besides

      assuring the people of his eternal damnation, to represent his last

      distemper as a visible judgment of Heaven upon him for his multiplied

      heresies and impieties.[***]

     

      The proselytes, however, of Wickliffe’s opinions still increased in

      England:[****] some monkish writers represent one half of the kingdom as

      infected by those principles: they were carried over to Bohemia by some

      youth of that nation, who studied at Oxford: but though the age seemed

      strongly disposed to receive them, affairs were not yet fully ripe for

      this great revolution; and the finishing blow to ecclesiastical power was

      reserved to a period of more curiosity, literature, and inclination for

      novelties.

     

      Meanwhile the English parliament continued to check the clergy and the

      court of Rome, by more sober and more legal expedients. They enacted anew

      the statute of “provisors,” and affixed higher penalties to the

      transgression of it, which, in some instances, was even made capital.[*]

      The court of Rome had fallen upon a new device, which increased their

      authority over the prelates: the pope, who found that the expedient of

      arbitrarily depriving them was violent, and liable to opposition, attained

      the same end by transferring such of them as were obnoxious to poorer

      sees, and even to nominal sees, “in partibus infidelium.” It was thus that

      the archbishop of York, and the bishops of Durham and Chichester, the

      king’s ministers, had been treated after the prevalence of Glocester’s

      faction: the bishop of Carlisle met with the same fate after the accession

      of Henry IV. For the pope always joined with the prevailing powers, when

      they did not thwart his pretensions. The parliament, in the reign of

      Richard, enacted a law against this abuse: and the king made a general

      remonstrance to the court of Rome against all those usurpations, which he

      calls “horrible excesses” of that court.[**]

     

      It was usual for the church, that they might elude the mortmain act, to

      make their votaries leave lands in trust to certain persons, under whose

      name the clergy enjoyed the benefit of the bequest: the parliament also

      stopped the progress of this abuse.[***] In the seventeenth of the king,

      the commons prayed, “that remedy might be had against such religious

      persons as cause their villains to marry free women inheritable, whereby

      the estate comes to those religious hands by collusion.”[****] This was a

      new device of the clergy.

     

      The papacy was at this time somewhat weakened by a schism, which lasted

      during forty years, and gave great scandal to the devoted partisans of the

      holy see. After the pope had resided many years at Avignon, Gregory XI.

      was persuaded to return to Rome; and upon his death, which happened in

      1380, the Romans, resolute to fix, for the future, the seat of the papacy

      in Italy, besieged the cardinals in the conclave, and compelled them,

      though they were mostly Frenchmen, to elect Urban VI., an Italian, into

      that high dignity. The French cardinals, as soon as they recovered their

      liberty, fled from Rome, and protesting against the forced election, chose

      Robert, son of the count of Geneva, who took the name of Clement VII., and

      resided at Avignon. All the Kingdoms of Christendom, according to their

      several interests and inclinations, were divided between these two

      pontiffs. The court of France adhered to Clement, and was followed by its

      allies, the king of Castile and the king of Scotland: England of course

      was thrown into the other party, and declared for Urban. Thus the

      appellation of Clementines and Urbanists distracted Europe for several

      years; and each party damned the other as schismatics, and as rebels to

      the true vicar of Christ. But this circumstance, though it weakened the

      papal authority, had not so great an effect as might naturally be

      imagined. Though any king could easily, at first, make his kingdom embrace

      the party of one pope or the other, or even keep it some time in suspense

      between them, he could not so easily transfer his obedience at pleasure:

      the people attached themselves to their own party, as to a religious

      opinion; and conceived an extreme abhorrence to the opposite party, whom

      they regarded as little better than Saracens, or infidels. Crusades were

      even undertaken in this quarrel; and the zealous bishop of Norwich, in

      particular, led over, in 1382 near sixty thousand bigots into Flanders

      against the Clementines; but after losing a great part of his followers,

      he returned with disgrace into England.[*] Each pope, sensible, from this

      prevailing spirit among the people, that the kingdom which once embraced

      his cause would always adhere to him, boldly maintained all the

      pretensions of his see, and stood not much more in awe of the temporal

      sovereigns, than if his authority had not been endangered by a rival.

     

      We meet with this preamble to a law enacted at the very beginning of this

      reign: “Whereas divers persons of small garrison of land or other

      possessions do make great retinue of people, as well of esquires as of

      others, in many parts of the realm, giving to them hats and other livery

      of one suit by year taking again towards them the value of the same

      livery, or percase the double value, by such covenant and assurance, that

      every of them shall maintain other in all quarrels, be they reasonable or

      unreasonable, to the great mischief and oppression of the people,

      etc.”[**]

     

      This preamble contains a true picture of the state of the kingdom. The

      laws had been so feebly executed, even during the long, active, and

      vigilant reign of Edward III., that no subject could trust to their

      protection. Men openly associated themselves, under the patronage of some

      great baron, for their mutual defence. They wore public badges, by which

      their confederacy was distinguished. They supported each other in all

      quarrels, iniquities, extortions, murders, robberies, and other crimes.

      Their chief was more their sovereign than the king himself; and their own

      band was more connected with them than their country. Hence the perpetual

      turbulence, disorders, factions, and civil wars of those times: hence the

      small regard paid to a character, or the opinion of the public: hence the

      large discretionary prerogatives of the crown, and the danger which might

      have ensued from the too great limitation of them. If the king had

      possessed no arbitrary powers, while all the nobles assumed and exercised

      them, there must have ensued an absolute anarchy in the state.

     

      One great mischief attending these confederacies was, the extorting from

      the king pardons for the most enormous crimes. The parliament often

      endeavored, in the last reign, to deprive the prince of this prerogative;

      but, in the present, they were content with an abridgment of it. They

      enacted, that no pardon for rapes, or for murder from malice prepense,

      should be valid, unless the crime were particularly specified in it.[*]

      There were also some other circumstances required for passing any pardon

      of this kind: an excellent law, but ill observed, like most laws that

      thwart the manners of the people, and the prevailing customs of the times.

     

      It is easy to observe, from these voluntary associations among the people,

      that the whole force of the feudal system was in a manner dissolved, and

      that the English had nearly returned, in that particular, to the same

      situation in which they stood before the Norman conquest. It was, indeed,

      impossible that that system could long subsist under the perpetual

      revolutions to winch landed property is every where subject. When the

      great feudal baronies were first erected, the lord lived in opulence in

      the midst of his vassals: he was in a situation to protect, and cherish

      and defend them: the quality of patron naturally united itself to that of

      superior: and these two principles of authority mutually supported each

      other. But when by the various divisions and mixtures of property, a man’s

      superior came to live at a distance from him, and could no longer give him

      shelter or countenance, the tie gradually became more fictitious than

      real: new connections from vicinity or other causes were formed:

      protection was sought by voluntary services and attachment: the appearance

      of valor spirit, abilities in any great man, extended his interest very

      far, and if the sovereign were deficient in these qualities, he was no

      less, if not more exposed to the usurpations of the aristocracy, than even

      during the vigor of the feudal system.

     

      The greatest novelty introduced into the civil government during this

      reign was the creation of peers by patent. Lord Beauchamp, of Holt, was

      the first peer that was advanced to the house of lords in this manner. The

      practice of levying benevolences is also first mentioned in the present

      reign. This prince lived in a more magnificent manner than perhaps any of

      his predecessors or successors. His household consisted of ten thousand

      persons: he had three hundred in his kitchen; and all the other offices

      were furnished in proportion.[*] It must be remarked, that this enormous

      train had tables supplied them at the king’s expense, according to the

      mode of that age. Such prodigality was probably the source of many

      exactions by purveyors, and was one chief reason of the public

      discontents
