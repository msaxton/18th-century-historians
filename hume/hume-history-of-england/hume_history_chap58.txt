While the king’s affairs declined in England, some events happened in

Scotland which seemed to promise him a more prosperous issue of the

quarrel.

 

Before the commencement of these civil disorders, the earl of Montrose, a

young nobleman of a distinguished family, returning from his travels, had

been introduced to the king, and had made an offer of his services; but by

the insinuations of the marquis, afterwards duke of Hamilton, who

possessed much of Charles’s confidence, he had not been received with that

distinction to which he thought himself justly entitled.[*]

 

Disgusted with this treatment, he had forwarded all the violence of the

Covenanters; and, agreeably to the natural ardor of his genius, he had

employed himself, during the first Scottish insurrection, with great zeal,

as well as success, in levying and conducting their armies. Being

commissioned by the “Tables,” to wait upon the king while the royal army

lay at Berwick, he was so gained by the civilities and caresses of that

monarch, that he thenceforth devoted himself entirely, though secretly, to

his service, and entered into a close correspondence with him. In the

second insurrection, a great military command was intrusted to him by the

Covenanters; and he was the first that passed the Tweed, at the head of

their troops, in the invasion of England. He found means, however, soon

after to convey a letter to the king; and by the infidelity of some about

that prince,—Hamilton as was suspected,—a copy of this letter

was sent to Leven, the Scottish general. Being accused of treachery, and a

correspondence with the enemy, Montrose openly avowed the letter, and

asked the generals if they dared to call their sovereign an enemy; and by

this bold and magnanimous behavior he escaped the danger of an immediate

prosecution. As he was now fully known to be of the royal party, he no

longer concealed his principles; and he endeavored to draw those who had

entertained like sentiments into a bond of association for his master’s

service. Though thrown into prison for this enterprise,[*] and detained

some time, he was not discouraged; but still continued, by his countenance

and protection, to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists. Among

other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was Lord Napier

of Merchiston, son of the famous inventor of the logarithms, the person to

whom the title of a “great man” is more justly due, than to any other whom

his country ever produced. There was in Scotland another party, who,

professing equal attachment to the king’s service, pretended only to

differ with Montrose about the means of attaining the same end; and of

that party Duke Hamilton was the leader. This nobleman had cause to be

extremely devoted to the king, not only by reason of the connection of

blood which united him to the royal family, but on account of the great

confidence and favor with which he had ever been honored by his master.

Being accused by Lord Rae, not without some appearance of probability, of

a conspiracy against the king, Charles was so far from harboring suspicion

against him, that, the very first time Hamilton came to court, he received

him into his bed-chamber, and passed alone the night with him.[**] But

such was the duke’s unhappy fate or conduct, that he escaped not the

imputation of treachery to his friend and sovereign; and though he at last

sacrificed his life in the king’s service, his integrity and sincerity

have not been thought by historians entirely free from blemish. Perhaps

(and this is the more probable opinion) the subtleties and refinements of

his conduct, and his temporizing maxims, though accompanied with good

intentions, have been the chief cause of a suspicion which has never yet

been either fully proved or refuted.

 

As much as the bold and vivid spirit of Montrose prompted him to

enterprising measures, as much was the cautious temper of Hamilton

inclined to such as were moderate and dilatory. While the former foretold

that the Scottish Covenanters were secretly forming a union with the

English parliament, and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by

some vigorous undertaking, the latter still insisted, that every such

attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were

not perhaps inclined. After the Scottish convention was summoned without

the king’s authority, the former exclaimed, that their intentions were now

visible, and that if some unexpected blow were not struck to dissipate

them, they would arm the whole nation against the king; the latter

maintained the possibility of outvoting the disaffected party, and

securing by peaceful means the allegiance of the kingdom.[*] Unhappily for

the royal cause, Hamilton’s representations met with more credit from the

king and queen than those of Montrose; and the Covenanters were allowed,

without interruption, to proceed in all their hostile measures. Montrose

then hastened to Oxford where his invectives against Hamilton’s treachery,

concurring with the general prepossession, and supported by the

unfortunate event of his counsels, were entertained with universal

probation. Influenced by the clamor of his party, more than his own

suspicions, Charles, as soon as Hamilton appeared, sent him prisoner to

Pendennis Castle, in Cornwall. His brother Laneric, who was also put under

confinement found means to make his escape, and to fly into Scotland.

 

The king’s ears were now open to Montrose’s counsels, who proposed none

but the boldest and most daring, agreeably to the desperate state of the

royal cause in Scotland. Though the whole nation was subjected by the

Covenanters, though great armies were kept on foot by them, and every

place guarded by a vigilant administration, he undertook, by his own

credit, and that of the few friends who remained to the king, to raise

such commotions as would soon oblige the malecontents to recall those

forces which had so sensibly thrown the balance in favor of the

parliament.[**] Not discouraged with the defeat at Marston Moor, which

rendered it impossible for him to draw any succor from England, he was

content to stipulate with the earl of Antrim, a nobleman of Ireland, for

some supply of men from that country. And he himself changing his

disguises, and passing through many dangers, arrived in Scotland; where he

lay concealed in the borders of the Highlands, and secretly prepared the

minds of his partisans for attempting some great enterprise.[***]

 

No sooner were the Irish landed, though not exceeding eleven hundred foot,

very ill armed, than Montrose declared himself, and entered upon that

scene of action which has rendered his name so celebrated. About eight

hundred of the men of Athole flocked to his standard. Five hundred men

more, who had been levied by the Covenanters, were persuaded to embrace

the royal cause: and with this combined force, he hastened to attack Lord

Elcho, who lay at Perth with an army of six thousand men, assembled upon

the first news of the Irish invasion. Montrose, inferior in number,

totally unprovided with horse, ill supplied with arms and ammunition, had

nothing to depend on, but the courage which he himself, by his own

example, and the rapidity of his enterprises, should inspire into his raw

soldiers. Having received the fire of the enemy, which was answered

chiefly by a volley of stones, he rushed amidst them with his sword drawn,

threw them into confusion, pushed his advantage, and obtained a complete

victory, with the slaughter of two thousand of the Covenanters.[*]

 

This victory, though it augmented the renown of Montrose, increased not

his power or numbers. The far greater part of the kingdom was extremely

attached to the covenant; and such as bore an affection to the royal

cause, were terrified by the established authority of the opposite party.

Dreading the superior power of Argyle, who, having joined his vassals to a

force levied by the public, was approaching with a considerable army,

Montrose hastened northwards, in order to rouse again the marquis of

Huntley and the Gordons, who, having before hastily taken arms, had been

instantly suppressed by the Covenanters. He was joined on his march by the

earl of Airly, with his two younger sons, Sir Thomas and Sir David Ogilvy:

the eldest was at that time a prisoner with the enemy. He attacked at

Aberdeen the Lord Burley, who commanded a force of two thousand five

hundred men. After a sharp combat, by his undaunted courage, which in his

situation was true policy, and was also not unaccompanied with military

skill, he put the enemy to flight, and in the pursuit did great execution

upon them.[**]

 

But by this second advantage he obtained not the end which he expected.

The envious nature of Huntley, jealous of Montrose’s glory, rendered him

averse to join an army where he himself must be so much eclipsed by the

superior merit of the general. Argyle, reÃ«nforced by the earl of Lothian,

was behind him with a great army: the militia of the northern counties,

Murray, Ross, Caithness, to the number of five thousand men, opposed him

in front, and guarded the banks of the Spey, a deep and rapid river. In

order to elude these numerous armies, he turned aside into the hills, and

saved his weak but active troops in Badenoch. After some marches and

countermarches, Argyle came up with him at Faivy Castle. This nobleman’s

character, though celebrated for political courage and conduct, was very

low for military prowess, and after some skirmishes, in which he was

worsted, he here allowed Montrose to escape him. By quick marches through

these inaccessible mountains, that general freed himself from the superior

forces of the Covenanters.

 

Such was the situation of Montrose, that very good or very ill fortune was

equally destructive to him, and diminished his army. After every victory,

his soldiers, greedy of spoil, but deeming the smallest acquisition to be

unexhausted riches, deserted in great numbers, and went home to secure the

treasures which they had acquired. Tired too, and spent with hasty and

long marches in the depth of winter, through snowy mountains, unprovided

with every necessary, they fell off, and left their general almost alone

with the Irish, who, having no place to which they could retire, still

adhered to him in every fortune.

 

With these, and some reÃ«nforcements of the Atholemen and Macdonalds whom

he had recalled, Montrose fell suddenly upon Argyle’s country, and let

loose upon it all the rage of war; carrying off the cattle, burning the

houses, and putting the inhabitants to the sword. This severity, by which

Montrose sullied his victories, was the result of private animosity

against the chieftain, as much as of zeal for the public cause, Argyle,

collecting three thousand men, marched in quest of the enemy, who had

retired with their plunder; and he lay at Innerlochy, supposing himself

still at a considerable distance from them. The earl of Seaforth, at the

head of the garrison of Inverness, who were veteran soldiers, joined to

five thousand new levied troops of the northern counties, pressed the

royalists on the other side, and threatened them with inevitable

destruction. By a quick and unexpected march, Montrose hastened to

Innerlochy, and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised

but not affrightened Covenanters. Argyle alone, seized with a panic,

deserted his army, who still maintained their ground, and gave battle to

the royalists. After a vigorous resistance, they were defeated, and

pursued with great slaughter.[*] And the power of the Campbells (that is

Argyle’s name) being thus broken, the Highlanders, who were in general

well affected to the royal cause, began to join Montrose’s camp in great

numbers. Seaforth’s army dispersed of itself, at the very terror of his

name. And Lord Gordon, eldest son of Huntley, having escaped from his

uncle Argyle, who had hitherto detained him, now joined Montrose, with no

contemptible number of his followers, attended by his brother, the earl of

Aboine.

 

The council at Edinburgh, alarmed at Montrose’s progress, began to think

of a more regular plan of defence against an enemy whose repeated

victories had rendered him extremely formidable. They sent for Baillie, an

officer of reputation, from England; and joining him in command with

Urrey, who had again enlisted himself among the king’s enemies, they sent

them to the field with a considerable army against the royalists.

Montrose, with a detachment of eight hundred men, had attacked Dundee, a

town extremely zealous for the covenant, and having carried it by assault,

had delivered it up to be plundered by his soldiers; when Baillie and

Urrey, with their whole force, were unexpectedly upon him.[**] His conduct

and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous. Instantly he

called off his soldiers from plunder, put them in order, secured his

retreat by the most skilful measures; and having marched sixty miles in

the face of an enemy much superior, without stopping, or allowing his

soldiers the least sleep or refreshment, he at last secured himself in the

mountains.

 

Baillie and Urrey now divided their troops, in order the better to conduct

the war against an enemy who surprised them as much by the rapidity of his

marches, as by the boldness of his enterprises. Urrey, at the head of four

thousand men, met him at Alderne, near Inverness; and, encouraged by the

superiority of number, (for the Covenanters were double the royalists,)

attacked him in the post which he had chosen Montrose, having placed his

right wing in strong ground, drew the best of his forces to the other, and

left no main body between them; a defect which he artfully concealed, by

showing a few men through the trees and bushes with which that ground was

covered. That Urrey might have no leisure to perceive the stratagem, he

instantly led his left wing to the charge; and, making a furious

impression upon the Covenanters, drove them off the field, and gained a

complete victory.[*] In this battle, the valor of young Napier, son to the

lord of that name, shone out with signal lustre.

 

Baillie now advanced, in order to revenge Urrey’s discomfiture; but at

Alford he met himself with a like fate. Montrose, weak in cavalry, here

lined his troops of horse with infantry; and after putting the enemy’s

horse to rout, fell with united force upon their foot, who were entirely

cut in pieces, though with the loss of the gallant Lord Gordon on the part

of the royalists.[**] And having thus prevailed in so many battles, which

his vigor ever rendered as decisive as they were successful, he summoned

together all his friends and partisans, and prepared himself for marching

into the southern provinces, in order to put a final period to the power

of the Covenanters, and dissipate the parliament, which, with great pomp

and solemnity, they had summoned to meet at St. Johnstone’s.

 

While the fire was thus kindled in the north of the island, it blazed out

with no less fury in the south: the parliamentary and royal armies, as

soon as the season would permit, prepared to take the field, in hopes of

bringing their important quarrel to a quick decision. The passing of the

self-denying ordinance had been protracted by so many debates and

intrigues, that the spring was far advanced before it received the

sanction of both houses; and it was thought dangerous by many to

introduce, so near the time of action, such great innovations into the

army. Had not the punctilious principles of Essex engaged him, amidst all

the disgusts which he received, to pay implicit obedience to the

parliament, this alteration had not been effected without some fatal

accident: since, notwithstanding his prompt resignation of the command, a

mutiny was generally apprehended.[***]

 

Fairfax, or, more properly speaking, Cromwell under his name, introduced

at last the new model into the army, and threw the troops into a different

shape. From the same men new regiments and new companies were formed,

different officers appointed, and the whole military force put into such

hands as the Independents could rely on. Besides members of parliament who

were excluded, many officers, unwilling to serve under the new generals,

threw up their commissions, and unwarily facilitated the project of

putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction.

 

Though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not

contemptible, a more exact plan was introduced, and rigorously executed,

by these new commanders. Valor indeed was very generally diffused over the

one party as well as the other, during this period: discipline also was

attained by the forces of the parliament: but the perfection of the

military art, in concerting the general plans of action and the operations

of the field, seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure

wanting. Historians at least, perhaps from their own ignorance and

inexperience, have not remarked any thing but a headlong, impetuous

conduct; each party hurrying to a battle, where valor and fortune chiefly

determined the success. The great ornament of history, during these

reigns, are the civil, not the military transactions.

 

Never surely was a more singular army assembled, than that which was now

set on foot by the parliament. To the greater number of the regiments

chaplains were not appointed, the officers assumed the spiritual duty, and

united it with their military functions. During the intervals of action,

they occupied themselves in sermons, prayers, exhortations; and the same

emulation there attended them, which in the field is so necessary to

support the honor of that profession. Rapturous ecstasies supplied the

place of study and reflection; and while the zealous devotees poured out

their thoughts in unpremeditated harangues, they mistook that eloquence

which to their own surprise, as well as that of others, flowed in upon

them, for divine illuminations, and for illapses of the Holy Spirit.

Wherever they were quartered, they excluded the minister from his pulpit;

and, usurping his place, conveyed their sentiments to the audience, with

all the authority which followed their power, their valor, and their

military exploits, united to their appearing zeal and fervor. The private

soldiers, seized with the same spirit, employed their vacant hours in

prayer, in perusing the Holy Scriptures, in ghostly conferences where they

compared the progress of their in grace, and mutually stimulated each

other to further advances in the great work of their salvation. When they

were marching to battle, the whole field resounded, as well with psalms

and spiritual songs adapted to the occasion, as with the instruments of

military music:[*] and every man endeavored to drown the sense of present

danger in the prospect of that crown of glory which was set before him. In

so holy a cause, wounds were esteemed meritorious; death, martyrdom; and

the hurry and dangers of action, instead of banishing their pious visions,

rather served to impress their minds more strongly with them.

 

The royalists were desirous of throwing a ridicule on this fanaticism of

the parliamentary armies, without being sensible how much reason they had

to apprehend its dangerous consequences. The forces assembled by the king

at Oxford, in the west, and in other places, were equal, if not superior

in number to their adversaries; but actuated by a very different spirit.

That license which had been introduced by want of pay, had risen to a

great height among them, and rendered them more formidable to their

friends than to their enemies. Prince Rupert, negligent of the people,

fond of the soldiery, had indulged the troops in unwarrantable liberties:

Wilmot, a man of dissolute manners, had promoted the same spirit of

disorder: and the licentious Goring, Gerrard, Sir Richard Granville, now

carried it to a great pitch of enormity. In the west especially, where

Goring commanded, universal spoil and havoc were committed; and the whole

country was laid waste by the rapine of the army. All distinction of

parties being in a manner dropped, the most devoted friends of the church

and monarchy wished there for such success to the parliamentary forces as

might put an end to these oppressions. The country people, despoiled of

their substance, flocked together in several places, armed with clubs and

staves; and though they professed an enmity to the soldiers of both

parties, their hatred was in most places levelled chiefly against the

royalists, from whom they had met with the worst treatment. Many thousands

of these tumultuary peasants were assembled in different parts of England;

who destroyed all such straggling soldiers as they met with, and much

infested the armies.[**]

 

The disposition of the forces on both sides was as follows: part of the

Scottish army was employed in taking Pomfret and other towns in Yorkshire:

part of it besieged Carlisle valiantly defended by Sir Thomas Glenham.

Chester, where Biron commanded, had long been blockaded by Sir William

Brereton; and was reduced to great difficulties. The king, being joined by

the princes Rupert and Maurice, lay at Oxford with a considerable army,

about fifteen thousand men. Fairfax and Cromwell were posted at Windsor,

with the new-modelled army, about twenty-two thousand men. Taunton, in the

county of Somerset, defended by Blake, suffered a long siege from Sir

Richard Granville, who commanded an army of about eight thousand men; and

though the defence had been obstinate, the garrison was now reduced to the

last extremity. Goring commanded in the west an army of nearly the same

number.[*]

 

On opening the campaign, the king formed the project of relieving Chester;

Fairfax, that of relieving Taunton. The king was first in motion. When he

advanced to Draiton, in Shropshire, Biron met him, and brought

intelligence that his approach had raised the siege, and that the

parliamentary army had withdrawn. Fairfax, having reached Salisbury in his

road westward, received orders from the committee of both kingdoms

appointed for the management of the war, to return and lay siege to

Oxford, now exposed by the king’s absence. He obeyed, after sending

Colonel Weldon to the west with a detachment of four thousand men. On

Weldon’s approach, Granville, who imagined that Fairfax with his whole

army was upon him, raised the siege, and allowed this pertinacious town,

now half taken and half burned, to receive relief: but the royalists,

being reÃ«nforced with three thousand horse under Goring, again advanced to

Taunton, and shut up Weldon, with his small army, in that ruinous

place.[**]

 

The king, having effected his purpose with regard to Chester returned

southwards: and in his way sat down before Leicester, a garrison of the

parliaments. Having made a breach in the wall, he stormed the town on all

sides; and, after a furious assault, the soldiers entered sword in hand,

and committed all those disorders to which their natural violence,

especially when inflamed by resistance, is so much addicted.[***]

 

A great booty was taken and distributed among them: fifteen hundred

prisoners fell into the king’s hands. This success, which struck a great

terror into the parliamentary army, determined Fairfax to leave Oxford,

which he was beginning to approach; and he marched towards the king, with

an intention of offering him battle. The king was advancing towards

Oxford, in order to raise the siege, which, he apprehended, was now begun;

and both armies, ere they were aware, had advanced within six miles of

each other. A council of war was called by the king, in order to

deliberate concerning the measures which he should now pursue. On the one

hand, it seemed more prudent to delay the combat; because Gerrard, who lay

in Wales with three thousand men, might be enabled in a little time to

join the army; and Goring, it was hoped, would soon be master of Taunton,

and having put the west in full security, would then unite his forces to

those of the king, and give him an incontestable superiority over the

enemy. On the other hand, Prince Rupert, whose boiling ardor still pushed

him on to battle, excited the impatient humor of the nobility and gentry

of which the army was full; and urged the many difficulties under which

the royalists labored, and from which nothing but a victory could relieve

them: the resolution was taken to give battle to Fairfax; and the royal

army immediately advanced upon him.

 

At Naseby was fought, with forces nearly equal, this decisive and

well-disputed action between the king and parliament. The main body of the

royalists was commanded by the king himself; the right wing by Prince

Rupert; the left by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. Fairfax, seconded by Skippon,

placed himself in the main body of the opposite army; Cromwell in the

right wing; Ireton, Cromwell’s son-in-law, in the left. The charge was

begun, with his usual celerity and usual success, by Prince Rupert. Though

Ireton made stout resistance, and even after he was run through the thigh

with a pike, still maintained the combat till he was taken prisoner, yet

was that whole wing broken, and pursued with precipitate fury by Rupert:

he was even so inconsiderate as to lose time in summoning and attacking

the artillery of the enemy, which had been left with a good guard of

infantry. The king led on his main body, and displayed in this action all

the conduct of a prudent general, and all the valor of a stout soldier.[*]

 

Fairfax and Skippon encountered him, and well supported that reputation

which they had acquired. Skippon, being dangerously wounded, was desired

by Fairfax to leave the field; but he declared that he would remain there

as long as one man maintained his ground.[*] The infantry of the

parliament was broken, and pressed upon by the king; till Fairfax, with

great presence of mind, brought up the reserve, and renewed the combat.

Meanwhile Cromwell, having led on his troops to the attack of Langdale,

overbore the force of the royalists, and by his prudence improved that

advantage which he had gained by his valor. Having pursued the enemy about

a quarter of a mile, and detached some troops to prevent their rallying,

he turned back upon the king’s infantry, and threw them into the utmost

confusion. One regiment alone preserved its order unbroken, though twice

desperately assailed by Fairfax: and that general, excited by so steady a

resistance, ordered Doyley, the captain of his life-guard, to give them a

third charge in front, while he himself attacked them in the rear. The

regiment was broken. Fairfax, with his own hands, killed an ensign, and,

having seized the colors, gave them to a soldier to keep for him. The

soldier, afterwards boasting that he had won this trophy, was reproved by

Doyley, who had seen the action. “Let him retain that honor,” said

Fairfax; “I have to-day acquired enough beside.”[**]

 

Prince Rupert, sensible too late of his error, left the fruitless attack

on the enemy’s artillery, and joined the king, whose infantry was now

totally discomfited. Charles exhorted this body of cavalry not to despair,

and cried aloud to them, “One charge more, and we recover the day.”[***]

But the disadvantages under which they labored were too evident; and they

could by no means be induced to renew the combat. Charles was obliged to

quit the field, and leave the victory to the enemy.[****]

 

The slain on the side of the parliament exceeded those on the side of the

king: they lost a thousand men; he not above eight hundred. But Fairfax

made five hundred officers prisoners, and four thousand private men; took

all the king’s artillery and ammunition, and totally dissipated his

infantry: so that scarce any victory could be more complete than that

which he obtained.

 

Among the other spoils was seized the king’s cabinet, with the copies of

his letters to the queen, which the parliament afterwards ordered to be

published.[*] They chose, no doubt, such of them as they thought would

reflect dishonor on him: yet, upon the whole, the letters are written with

delicacy and tenderness, and give an advantageous idea both of the king’s

genius and morals. A mighty fondness, it is true, and attachment, he

expresses to his consort, and often professes that he never would embrace

any measures which she disapproved: but such declarations of civility and

confidence are not always to be taken in a full, literal sense. And so

legitimate an affection, avowed by the laws of God and man, may perhaps be

excusable towards a woman of beauty and spirit, even though she was a

Papist.[**]

 

The Athenians, having intercepted a letter written by their enemy, Philip

of Macedon, to his wife Olympia, so far from being moved by a curiosity of

prying into the secrets of that relation, immediately sent the letter to

the queen unopened. Philip was not their sovereign; nor were they inflamed

with that violent animosity against him which attends all civil

commotions.

 

After the battle, the king retreated with that body of horse which

remained entire, first to Hereford, then to Abergavenny; and remained some

time in Wales, from the vain hope of raising a body of infantry in those

harassed and exhausted quarters. Fairfax, having first retaken Leicester,

which was surrendered upon articles, began to deliberate concerning his

future enterprises. A letter was brought him, written by Goring to the

king, and unfortunately intrusted to a spy of Fairfax’s. Goring there

informed the king, that in three weeks he hoped to be master of Taunton,

after which he would join his majesty with all the forces in the west; and

entreated him, in the mean while to avoid coming to any general action.

This letter, which, had it been safely delivered, had probably prevented

the battle of Naseby, served now to direct the operations of Fairfax.[*]

After leaving a body of three thousand men to Pointz and Rossiter, with

orders to attend the king’s motions, he marched immediately to the west,

with a view of saving Taunton, and suppressing the only considerable force

which now remained to the royalists.

 

In the beginning of the campaign, Charles, apprehensive of the event, had

sent the prince of Wales, then fifteen years of age, to the west, with the

title of General, and had given orders, if he were pressed by the enemy,

that he should make his escape into a foreign country, and save one part

of the royal family from the violence of the parliament. Prince Rupert had

thrown himself into Bristol, with an intention of defending that important

city. Goring commanded the army before Taunton.

 

On Fairfax’s approach, the siege of Taunton was raised; and the royalists

retired to Lamport, an open town in the county of Somerset. Fairfax

attacked them in that post, beat them from it, killed about three hundred

men, and took one thousand four hundred prisoners.[**] After this

advantage, he sat down before Bridgewater, a town esteemed strong, and of

great consequence in that country. When he had entered the outer town by

storm, Windham, the Governor, who had retired into the inner, immediately

capitulated, and delivered up the place to Fairfax. The garrison, to the

number of two thousand six hundred men, were made prisoners of war.

 

Fairfax, having next taken Bath and Sherborne, resolved to lay siege to

Bristol, and made great preparations for an enterprise which, from the

strength of the garrison, and the reputation of Prince Rupert, the

governor, was deemed of the last importance. But, so precarious in most

men is this quality of military courage, a poorer defence was not made by

any town during the whole war; and the general expectations were here

extremely disappointed. No sooner had the parliamentary forces entered the

lines by storm, than the prince capitulated, and surrendered the city to

Fairfax.[***] A few days before, he had written a letter to the king, in

which he undertook to defend the place for four months, if no mutiny

obliged him to surrender it.

 

Charles, who was forming schemes and collecting forces for the relief of

Bristol, was astonished at so unexpected an event, which was little less

fatal to his cause than the defeat at Naseby.[*] Full of indignation, he

instantly recalled all Prince Rupert’s commissions, and sent him a pass to

go beyond sea.[**]

 

The king’s affairs now went fast to ruin in all quarters. The Scots,

having made themselves masters of Carlisle, after an obstinate siege,

marched southwards, and laid siege to Hereford; but were obliged to raise

it on the king’s approach: and this was the last glimpse of success which

attended his arms. Having marched to the relief of Chester, which was anew

besieged by the parliamentary forces under Colonel Jones, Pointz attacked

his rear, and forced him to give battle. While the fight was continued

with great obstinacy, and victory seemed to incline to the royalists,

Jones fell upon them from the other side, and put them to rout, with the

loss of six hundred slain and one thousand prisoners.[***] The king, with

the remains of his broken army, fled to Newark, and thence escaped to

Oxford, where he shut himself up during the winter season.

 

The news which he received from every quarter, were no less fatal than

those events which passed where he himself was present. Fairfax and

Cromwell, after the surrender of Bristol, having divided their forces, the

former marched westwards, in order to complete the conquest of Devonshire

and Cornwall; the latter attacked the king’s garrisons which lay to the

east of Bristol. The Devizes were surrendered to Cromwell; Berkeley Castle

was taken by storm; Winchester capitulated; Basing House was entered sword

in hand; and all these middle counties of England were, in a little time,

reduced to obedience under the parliament.

 

1646.

 

The same rapid and uninterrupted success attended Fairfax. The

parliamentary forces, elated by past victories, governed by the most rigid

discipline, met with no equal opposition from troops dismayed by repeated

defeats, and corrupted by licentious manners. After beating up the

quarters of the royalists at Bovey Tracy, Fairfax sat down before

Dartmouth, and in a few days entered it by storm. Poudram Castle being

taken by him, and Exeter blockaded on all sides, Hopton, a man of merit,

who now commanded the royalists, having advanced to the relief of that

town with an army of eight thousand men, met with the parliamentary army

at Torrington, where he was defeated, all his foot dispersed, and he

himself with his horse obliged to retire into Cornwall. Fairfax followed

him, and vigorously pursued the victory. Having enclosed the royalists at

Truro, he forced the whole army, consisting of five thousand men, chiefly

cavalry, to surrender upon terms. The soldiers, delivering up their horses

and arms, were allowed to disband, and received twenty shillings apiece,

to carry them to their respective abodes. Such of the officers as desired

it had passes to retire beyond sea: the others, having promised never more

to bear arms, paid compositions to the parliament,[*] and procured their

pardon.[**] And thus Fairfax, after taking Exeter, which completed the

conquest of the west, marched with his victorious army to the centre of

the kingdom, and fixed his camp at Newbury. The prince of Wales, in

pursuance of the king’s orders, retired to Scilly, thence to Jersey;

whence he went to Paris, where he joined the queen, who had fled thither

from Exeter, at the time the earl of Essex conducted the parliamentary

army to the west.

 

In the other parts of England, Hereford was taken by surprise: Chester

surrendered: Lord Digby, who had attempted with one thousand two hundred

horse to break into Scotland and join Montrose, was defeated at Sherburne,

in Yorkshire, by Colonel Copley; his whole force was dispersed, and he

himself was obliged to fly, first to the Isle of Man, thence to Ireland.

News, too, arrived that Montrose himself, after some more successes, was

at last routed; and this only remaining hope of the royal party finally

extinguished.

 

When Montrose descended into the southern counties, the Covenanters,

assembling their whole force, met him with a numerous army, and gave him

battle, but without success, at Kilsyth.[***] This was the most complete

victory that Montrose ever obtained.

 

The royalists put to sword six thousand of their enemies, and left the

Covenanters no remains of any army in Scotland. The whole kingdom was

shaken with these repeated successes of Montrose; and many noblemen, who

secretly favored the royal cause, now declared openly for it when they saw

a force able to support them. The marquis of Douglas, the earls of

Annandale and Hartfield, the lords Fleming, Seton, Maderty, Carnegy, with

many others, flocked to the royal standard. Edinburgh opened its gates,

and gave liberty to all the prisoners there detained by the Covenanters.

Among the rest was Lord Ogilvy, son of Airly, whose family had contributed

extremely to the victory gained at Kilsyth.[*]

 

David Lesly was detached from the army in England, and marched to the

relief of his distressed party in Scotland. Montrose advanced still

farther to the south, allured by vain hopes, both of rousing to arms the

earls of Hume, Traquaire, and Roxborough, who had promised to join him;

and of obtaining from England some supply of cavalry, in which he was

deficient. By the negligence of his scouts, Lesly, at Philipbaugh in the

Forest, surprised his army, much diminished in numbers, from the desertion

of the Highlanders, who had retired to the hills, according to custom, in

order to secure their plunder. After a sharp conflict, where Montrose

exerted great valor, his forces were routed by Lesly’s cavalry;[**] and he

himself was obliged to fly with his broken forces into the mountains,

where he again prepared himself for new battles and new enterprises.[***]

 

The Covenanters used the victory with rigor. Their prisoners, Sir Robert

Spotiswood, secretary of state, and son to the late primate, Sir Philip

Nisbet, Sir William Hollo, Colonel Nathaniel Gordon, Andrew Guthry, son of

the bishop of Murray, William Murray, son of the earl of Tullibardine,

were condemned and executed. The sole crime imputed to the secretary was

his delivering to Montrose the king’s commission to be captain-general of

Scotland. Lord Ogilvy, who was again taken prisoner, would have undergone

the same fate, had not his sister found means to procure his escape by

changing clothes with him. For this instance of courage and dexterity, she

met with harsh usage. The clergy solicited the parliament that more

royalists might be executed; but could not obtain their request.[****]

 

After all these repeated disasters, which every where befell the royal

party, there remained only one body of troops on which fortune could

exercise her rigor. Lord Astley, with a small army of three thousand men,

chiefly cavalry, marching to Oxford in order to join the king, was met at

Stowe by Colonel Morgan, and entirely defeated, himself being taken

prisoner. “You have done your work,” said Astley to the parliamentary

officers; “and may now go to play, unless you choose to fall out among

yourselves.”[*]

 

The condition of the king during this whole winter was to the last degree

disastrous and melancholy. As the dread of ills is commonly more

oppressive than their real presence, perhaps in no period of his life was

he more justly the object of compassion. His vigor of mind, which, though

it sometimes failed him in acting, never deserted him in his sufferings,

was what alone supported him; and he was determined, as he wrote to Lord

Digby, if he could not live as a king, to die like a gentleman; nor should

any of his friends, he said, ever have reason to blush for the prince whom

they had so unfortunately served.[**] The murmurs of discontented

officers, on the one hand, harassed their unhappy sovereign; while they

overrated those services and sufferings which they now saw must forever go

unrewarded.[***] The affectionate duty, on the other hand, of his more

generous friends, who respected his misfortunes and his virtues as much as

his dignity, wrung his heart with a new sorrow, when he reflected that

such disinterested attachment would so soon be exposed to the rigor of his

implacable enemies. Repeated attempts which he made for a peaceful and

equitable accommodation with the parliament, served to no purpose but to

convince them that the victory was entirely in their hands. They deigned

not to make the least reply to several of his messages, in which he

desired a passport for commissioners.[****]

 

At last, after reproaching him with the blood spilt during the war, they

told him that they were preparing bills for him; and his passing them

would be the best pledge of his inclination towards peace: in other words,

he must yield at discretion.[*] He desired a personal treaty, and offered

to come to London, upon receiving a safe-conduct for himself and his

attendants: they absolutely refused him admittance, and issued orders for

the guarding, that is, the seizing of his person, in case he should

attempt to visit them.[**]

 

A new incident, which happened in Ireland, served to inflame the minds of

men, and to increase those calumnies with which his enemies had so much

loaded him, and which he ever regarded as the most grievous part of his

misfortunes. After the cessation with the Irish rebels, the king was

desirous of concluding a final peace with them, and obtaining their

assistance in England: and he gave authority to Ormond, lord lieutenant,

to promise them an abrogation of all the penal laws enacted against

Catholics; together with the suspension of Poinings’s statute, with regard

to some particular bills which should be agreed on. Lord Herbert, created

earl of Glamorgan, (though his patent had not yet passed the seals,)

having occasion for his private affairs to go to Ireland, the king

considered that this nobleman, being a Catholic, and allied to the best

Irish families, might be of service: he also foresaw that further

concessions with regard to religion might probably be demanded by the

bigoted Irish; and that, as these concessions, however necessary, would

give great scandal to the Protestant zealots in his three kingdoms, if

would be requisite both to conceal them during some time, and to preserve

Ormond’s character by giving private orders to Glamorgan to conclude and

sign these articles. But as he had a better opinion of Glamorgan’s zeal

and affection for his service than of his capacity, he enjoined him to

communicate all his measures to Ormond; and though the final conclusion of

the treaty must be executed only in Glamorgan’s own name, he was required

to be directed in the steps towards it by the opinion of the lord

lieutenant. Glamorgan, bigoted to his religion, and passionate for the

king’s service, but guided in these pursuits by no manner of judgment or

discretion, secretly, of himself, without any communication with Ormond,

concluded a peace with the council of Kilkenny, and agreed, in the king’s

name, that the Irish should enjoy all the churches of which they had ever

been in possession since the commencement of their insurrection, on

condition that they should assist the king in England with a body of ten

thousand men. This transaction was discovered by accident. The titular

archbishop of Tuam being killed by a sally of the garrison of Sligo, the

articles of the treaty were found among his baggage, and were immediately

published every where, and copies of them sent over to the English

parliament.[*] The lord lieutenant and Lord Digby, foreseeing the clamor

which would be raised against the king, committed Glamorgan to prison,

charged him with treason for his temerity, and maintained that he had

acted altogether without any authority from his master. The English

parliament, however, neglected not so favorable an opportunity of reviving

the old clamor with regard to the king’s favor of Popery, and accused him

of delivering over, in a manner, the whole kingdom of Ireland to that

hated sect. The king told them, “that the earl of Glamorgan, having made

an offer to raise forces in the kingdom of Ireland, and to conduct them

into England for his majesty’s service, had a commission to that purpose,

and to that purpose only; and that he had no commission at all to treat of

any thing else, without the privity and direction of the lord lieutenant,

much less to capitulate any thing concerning religion, or any property

belonging either to church or laity.”[**] Though this declaration seems

agreeable to truth, it gave no satisfaction to the parliament; and some

historians, even at present, when the ancient bigotry is somewhat abated,

are desirous of representing this very innocent transaction, in which the

king was engaged by the most violent necessity, as a stain on the memory

of that unfortunate prince.[***] 16
 

Having lost all hope of prevailing over the rigor of the parliament,

either by arms or by treaty, the only resource which remained to the king

was derived from the intestine dissensions which ran very high among his

enemies. Presbyterians and Independents, even before their victory was

fully completed, fell into contests about the division of the spoil; and

their religious as well as civil disputes agitated the whole kingdom.

 

The parliament, though they had early abolished Episcopal authority, had

not, during so long a time, substituted any other spiritual government in

its place; and their committees of religion had hitherto assumed the whole

ecclesiastical jurisdiction; but they now established, by an ordinance,

the Presbyterian model in all its forms of congregational, classical,

provincial, and national assemblies. All the inhabitants of each parish

were ordered to meet and choose elders, on whom together with the

minister, was bestowed the entire direction of all spiritual concerns

within the congregation. A number of neighboring parishes, commonly

between twelve and twenty, formed a classis; and the court which governed

this division was composed of all the ministers, together with two, three,

or four elders chosen from each parish. The provincial assembly retained

an inspection over several neighboring classes, and was composed entirely

of clergymen: the national assembly was constituted in the same manner;

and its authority extended over the whole kingdom. It is probable, that

the tyranny exercised by the Scottish clergy, had given warning not to

allow laymen a place in the provincial or national assemblies; lest the

nobility and more considerable gentry, soliciting a seat in these great

ecclesiastical courts, should bestow a consideration upon them, and render

them, in the eyes of the multitude, a rival to the parliament. In the

inferior courts, the mixture of the laity might serve rather to temper the

usual zeal of the clergy.[*]

 

But though the Presbyterians, by the establishment of parity among the

ecclesiastics, were so far gratified, they were denied satisfaction in

several other points on which they were extremely intent. The assembly of

divines had voted Presbytery to be of divine right: the parliament refused

their assent to that decision.[**] Selden, Whitlocke, and other political

reasoners, assisted by the Independents, had prevailed in this important

deliberation. They thought, that had the bigoted religionists been able to

get their heavenly charter recognized, the presbyters would soon become

more dangerous to the magistrate than had ever been the prelatical clergy.

These latter, white they claimed to themselves a divine right, admitted of

a like origin to civil authority: the former, challenging to their own

order a celestial pedigree, derived the legislative power from a source no

more dignified than the voluntary association of the people.

 

Under color of keeping the sacraments from profanation, the clergy of all

Christian sects had assumed what they call the power of the keys, or the

right of fulminating excommunication. The example of Scotland was a

sufficient lesson for the parliament to use precaution in guarding against

so severe a tyranny. They determined, by a general ordinance, all the

cases in which excommunication could be used. They allowed of appeals to

parliament from all ecclesiastical courts. And they appointed

commissioners in every province to judge of such cases as fell not within

their general ordinance.[*] So much civil authority, intermixed with the

ecclesiastical, gave disgust to all the zealots.

 

But nothing was attended with more universal scandal than the propensity

of many in the parliament towards a toleration of the Protestant

sectaries. The Presbyterians exclaimed, that this indulgence made the

church of Christ resemble Noah’s ark, and rendered it a receptacle for all

unclean beasts. They insisted, that the least of Christ’s truths was

superior to all political considerations.[**] They maintained the eternal

obligation imposed by the covenant to extirpate heresy and schism. And

they menaced all their opponents with the same rigid persecution under

which they themselves had groaned, when held in subjection by the

hierarchy.

 

So great prudence and reserve, in such material points, does great honor

to the parliament; and proves that, notwithstanding the prevalency of

bigotry and fanaticism, there were many members who had more enlarged

views, and paid regard to the civil interests of society. These men,

uniting themselves to the enthusiasts, whose genius is naturally averse to

clerical usurpations, exercised so jealous an authority over the assembly

of divines, that they allowed them nothing but the liberty of tendering

advice, and would not intrust them even with the power of electing their

own chairman or his substitute, or of supplying the vacancies of their own

members.

 

While these disputes were canvassed by theologians, who engaged in their

spiritual contests every order of the state the king, though he

entertained hopes of reaping advantage from those divisions, was much at a

loss which side it would be most for his interest to comply with. The

Presbyterians were, by their principles, the least averse to regal

authority but were rigidly bent on the extirpation of prelacy: the

Independents were resolute to lay the foundation of a republican

government; but as they pretended not to erect themselves into a national

church, it might be hoped that, if gratified with am toleration, they

would admit the reÃ«stablishment of the hierarchy. So great attachment had

the king to episcopal jurisdiction, that he was ever inclined to put it in

balance even with his own power and kingly office.

 

But whatever advantage he might hope to reap from the divisions in the

parliamentary party, he was apprehensive lest it should come too late to

save him from the destruction with which he was instantly threatened.

Fairfax was approaching with a powerful and victorious army, and was

taking the proper measures for laying siege to Oxford, which must

infallibly fall into his hands. To be taken captive, and led in triumph by

his insolent enemies, was what Charles justly abhorred; and every insult,

if not violence, was to be dreaded from that enthusiastic soldiery who

hated his person and despised his dignity. In this desperate extremity, he

embraced a measure which, in any other situation, might lie under the

imputation of imprudence and indiscretion.

 

Montreville, the French minister, interested for the king more by the

natural sentiments of humanity than any instructions from his court, which

seemed rather to favor the parliament, had solicited the Scottish generals

and commissioners to give protection to their distressed sovereign; and

having received many general professions and promises, he had always

transmitted these, perhaps with some exaggeration, to the king. From his

suggestions, Charles began to entertain thoughts of leaving Oxford, and

flying to the Scottish army, which at that time lay before Newark.[*] He

considered, that the Scottish nation had been fully gratified in all their

demands; and having already, in their own country, annihilated both

episcopacy and regal authority, had no further concessions to exact from

him. In all disputes which had passed about settling the terms of peace,

the Scots, he heard, had still adhered to the milder side, and had

endeavored to soften the rigor of the English parliament. Great disgusts

also, on other accounts, had taken place between the nations; and the

Scots found that, in proportion as their assistance became less necessary,

less value was put upon them. The progress of the Independents gave them

great alarm; and they were scandalized to hear their beloved covenant

spoken of every day with less regard, and reverence. The refusal of a

divine right to presbytery, and the infringing of ecclesiastical

discipline from political considerations, were to them the subject of much

offence; and the king hoped that, in their present disposition, the plight

of their native prince, flying to them in this extremity of distress,

would rouse every-spark of generosity in their bosom, and procure him

their favor and protection.

 

That he might the better conceal his intentions, orders were given at

every gate in Oxford for allowing three persons to pass; and in the night

the king, accompanied by none but Dr. Hudson and Mr. Ashburnham, went out

at that gate which leads to London. He rode before a portmanteau, and

called himself Ashburnham’s servant. He passed through Henley, St. Albans,

and came so near to London as Harrow on the Hill. He once entertained

thoughts of entering into that city, and of throwing himself on the mercy

of the parliament. But at last, after passing through many cross roads, he

arrived at the Scottish camp before Newark.[*] The parliament, hearing of

his escape from Oxford, issued rigorous orders, and threatened with

instant death whoever should harbor or conceal him.[**]

 

The Scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the

appearance of the king; and though they paid him all the exterior respect

due to his dignity, they instantly set a guard upon him, under color of

protection, and made him in reality a prisoner. They informed the English

parliament of this unexpected incident, and assured them that they had

entered into no private treaty with the king. They applied to him for

orders to Bellasis, governor of Newark, to surrender that town, now

reduced to extremity; and the orders were instantly obeyed. And hearing

that the parliament laid claim to the entire disposal of the king’s

person, and that the English army was making some motion towards them,

they thought proper to retire northwards, and to fix their camp at

Newcastle.[***]

 

This measure was very grateful to the king; and he began to entertain

hopes of protection from the Scots. He was particularly attentive to the

behavior of their preachers, on whom all depended. It was the mode of that

age to make the pulpit the scene of news; and on every great event, the

whole Scripture was ransacked by the clergy for passages applicable to the

present occasion. The first minister who preached before the king chose

these words for his text: “And behold all the men of Israel came to the

king, and said unto him, Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen

thee away, and have brought the king and his household, and all David’s

men with him, over Jordan? And all the men of Judah answered the men of

Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then be ye angry

for this matter? Have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given

us any gift? And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, We

have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye:

why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in

bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer

than the words of the men of Israel.”[*] But the king soon found, that the

happiness chiefly of the allusion had tempted the preacher to employ this

text, and that the covenanting zealots were nowise pacified towards him.

Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his

misgovernment, ordered this psalm to be sung:—

 

“Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself, Thy wicked deeds to praise?”

 

The king stood up, and called for that psalm which begins with these

words,

 

“Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray; For men would me devour.”

 

The good-natured audience, in pity to fallen majesty, showed for once

greater deference to the king than to the minister, and sung the psalm

which the former had called for.[**]

 

Charles had very little reason to be pleased with his situation. He not

only found himself a prisoner, very strictly guarded: all his friends were

kept at a distance; and no intercourse, either by letters or conversation,

was allowed him with any one on whom he could depend, or who was suspected

of any attachment towards him. The Scottish generals would enter into no

confidence with him; and still treated him with distant ceremony and

feigned respect. And every proposal which they made him tended further to

his abasement and to his ruin.[***]

 

They required him to issue orders to Oxford and to all his other

garrisons, commanding their surrender to the parliament; and the king,

sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose, willingly

complied. The terms given to most of them were honorable; and Fairfax, as

far as it lay in his power, was very exact in observing them. Far from

allowing violence, he would not even permit insults or triumph over the

unfortunate royalists; and by his generous humanity, so cruel a civil war

was ended, in appearance, very calmly between the parties.

 

Ormond, having received like orders, delivered Dublin and other forts into

the hands of the parliamentary officers. Montrose also, after having

experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his

arms, and retired out of the kingdom.

 

The marquis of Worcester, a man past eighty-four, was the last in England

that submitted to the authority of the parliament. He defended Raglan

Castle to extremity; and opened not its gates till the middle of August.

Four years, a few days excepted, were now elapsed since the king first

erected his standard at Nottingham:[*] so long had the British nations, by

civil and religious quarrels, been occupied in shedding their own blood,

and laying waste their native country.

 

The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king. They

were such as a captive, entirely at mercy, could expect from the most

inexorable victor. Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on

before the battle of Naseby. The power of the sword, instead of ten, which

the king now offered, was demanded for twenty years, together with a right

to levy whatever money the parliament should think proper for the support

of their armies. The other conditions were, in the main, the same with

those which had formerly been offered to the king.[**]

 

Charles said, that proposals which introduced such important innovations

in the constitution, demanded time for deliberation: the commissioners

replied, that he must give his answer in ten days.[***] He desired to

reason about the meaning and import of some terms: they informed him, that

they had no power of debate; and peremptorily required his consent or

refusal. He requested a personal treaty with the parliament. They

threatened that, if he delayed compliance, the parliament would, by their

own authority, settle the nation.

 

What the parliament was most intent upon, was not their treaty with the

king, to whom they paid little regard, but that with the Scots. Two

important points remained to be settled with that nation: their delivery

of the king, and the estimation of their arrears.

 

The Scots might pretend, that, as Charles was king of Scotland as well as

of England, they were entitled to an equal vote in the disposal of his

person; and that, in such a case, where the titles are equal, and the

subject indivisible, the preference was due to the present possessor. The

English maintained, that the king, being in England, was comprehended

within the jurisdiction of that kingdom, and could not be disposed of by

any foreign nation: a delicate question this, and what surely could not be

decided by precedent; since such a situation is not any where to be found

in history.[*]

 

As the Scots concurred with the English in imposing such severe conditions

on the king, that, notwithstanding his unfortunate situation, he still

refused to accept of them, it is certain that they did not desire his

freedom: nor could they ever intend to join lenity and rigor together, in

so inconsistent a manner. Before the settlement of terms, the

administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both

kingdoms; and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king,

is easily imagined. To carry him a prisoner into Scotland, where few

forces could be supported to guard him, was a measure so full of

inconvenience and danger, that, even if the English had consented to it,

it must have appeared to the Scots themselves altogether uneligible: and

how could such a plan be supported in opposition to England, possessed of

such numerous and victorious armies, which were, at that time at least

seemed to be, in entire union with the parliament? The only expedient, it

is obvious, which the Scots could embrace, if they scrupled wholly to

abandon the king, was immediately to return, fully and cordially, to their

allegiance; and, uniting themselves with the royalists in both kingdoms,

endeavor, by force of arms, to reduce the English parliament to more

moderate conditions: but, besides that this measure was full of extreme

hazard, what was it but instantly to combine with their old enemies

against their old friends; and, in a fit of romantic generosity, overturn

what, with so much expense of blood and treasure, they had, during the

course of so many years, been so carefully erecting?

 

But though all these reflections occurred to the Scottish commissioners,

they resolved to prolong the dispute, and to keep the king as a pledge for

those arrears which they claimed from England, and which they were not

likely, in the present disposition of that nation, to obtain by any other

expedient. The sum, by their account, amounted to near two millions: for

they had received little regular pay since they had entered England. And

though the contributions which they had levied, as well as the price of

their living at free quarters, must be deducted, yet still the sum which

they insisted on was very considerable. After many discussions, it was at

last agreed, that, in lieu of all demands, they should accept of four

hundred thousand pounds, one half to be paid instantly, another in two

subsequent payments.[*]

 

Great pains were taken by the Scots (and the English complied with their

pretended delicacy) to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear

a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the king’s

person: but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and

the same. The English, it is evident, had they not been previously assured

of receiving the king, would never have parted with so considerable a sum;

and, while they weakened themselves, by the same measure, have

strengthened a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an

interest to discuss.

 

Thus the Scottish nation underwent, and still undergo, (for such grievous

stains are not easily wiped off,) the reproach of selling their king and

betraying their prince for money. In vain did they maintain, that this

money was, on account of former services, undoubtedly their due; that in

their present situation, no other measure, without the utmost,

indiscretion, or even their apparent ruin, could be embraced; and that,

though they delivered their king into the hands of his open enemies they

were themselves as much his open enemies as those to whom they surrendered

him; and their common hatred against him had long united the two parties

in strict alliance with each other. They were still answered, that they

made use of this scandalous expedient for obtaining their wages; and that,

after taking arms without any provocation against their sovereign, who had

ever loved and cherished them, they had deservedly fallen into a situation

from which they could not extricate themselves without either infamy or

imprudence.

 

The infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the Scottish

parliament, that they once voted that the king should be protected, and

his liberty insisted on. But the general assembly interposed, and

pronounced that, as he had refused to take the covenant, which was pressed

on him, it became not the godly to concern themselves about his fortunes.

After this declaration, it behoved the parliament to retract their

vote.[*]

 

Intelligence concerning the final resolution of the Scottish nation to

surrender him, was brought to the king; and he happened, at that very

time, to be playing at chess.[**] Such command of temper did he possess,

that he continued his game without interruption; and none of the

bystanders could perceive that the letter which he perused had brought him

news of any consequence. The English commissioners, who, some days after,

came to take him under their custody, were admitted to kiss his hands; and

he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had

travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him. The old earl of

Pembroke, in particular, who was one of them, he congratulated on his

strength and vigor, that he was still able, during such a season, to

perform so long a journey, in company with so many young people.

 

1647.

 

The king, being delivered over by the Scots to the English commissioners,

was conducted under a guard to Holdenby, in the county of Northampton. On

his journey, the whole country flocked to behold him, moved partly by

curiosity, partly by compassion and affection. If any still retained

rancor against him, in his present condition, they passed in silence;

while his well-wishers, more generous than prudent, accompanied his march

with tears, with acclamations, and with prayers for his safety.[***] That

ancient superstition, likewise, of desiring the king’s touch in scrofulous

distempers, seemed to acquire fresh credit among the people, from the

general tenderness which began to prevail for this virtuous and unhappy

monarch.

 

The commissioners rendered his confinement at Holdenby very rigorous;

dismissing his ancient servants, debarring him from visits, and cutting

off all communication with his friends or family. The parliament, though

earnestly applied to by the king, refused to allow his chaplains to attend

him, because they had not taken the covenant. The king refused to assist

at the service exercised according to the directory; because he had not as

yet given his consent to that mode of worship.[*] Such religious zeal

prevailed on both sides; and such was the unhappy and distracted condition

to which it had reduced king and people.

 

During the time that the king remained in the Scottish army at Newcastle,

died the earl of Essex, the discarded, but still powerful and popular

general of the parliament. His death, in this conjuncture, was a public

misfortune. Fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been

carried, and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended,

he had resolved to conciliate a peace, and to remedy, as far as possible,

all those ills to which, from mistake rather than any bad intentions, he

had himself so much contributed. The Presbyterian, or the moderate party

among the commons, found themselves considerably weakened by his death;

and the small remains of authority, which still adhered to the house of

peers, were in a manner wholly extinguished.[**]
