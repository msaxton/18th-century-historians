THE late king, by the regulations which he imposed on the government of

his infant son, as well as by the limitations of the succession, had

projected to reign even after his decease; and he imagined that his

ministers, who had always been so obsequious to him during his lifetime,

would never afterwards depart from the plan which he had traced out to

them. He fixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his

eighteenth year; and as Edward was then only a few months past nine, he

appointed sixteen executors; to whom, during the minority, he intrusted

the government of the king and kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer,

archbishop of Canterbury; Lord Wriothesely, chancellor; Lord St. John,

great master; Lord Russel, privy seal; the earl of Hertford, chamberlain:

Viscount Lisle, admiral; Tonstal, bishop of Durham; Sir Anthony Brown,

master of horse; Sir William Paget, secretary of state; Sir Edward North,

chancellor of the court of augmentations; Sir Edward Montague, chief

justice of the common pleas; Judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir

William Herbert, chief gentlemen of the privy chamber; Sir Edward Wotton,

treasurer of Calais; Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury. To these executors,

with whom was intrusted the whole regal authority, were appointed twelve

counsellors, who possessed no immediate power, and could only assist with

their advice when any affair was laid before them. The council was

composed of the earls of Arundel and Essex; Sir Thomas Cheney, treasurer

of the household; Sir John Gage, comptroller; Sir Anthony Wingfield,

vice-chamberlain; Sir William Petre, secretary of state; Sir Richard Rich,

Sir John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard

Southwell, and Sir Edmund Peckham.[*] The usual caprice of Henry appears

somewhat in this nomination; while he appointed several persons of

inferior station among his executors, and gave only the place of

counsellor to a person of such high rank as the earl of Arundel, and to

Sir Thomas Seymour, the king’s uncle.

 

But the first act of the executors and counsellors was to depart from the

destination of the late king in a material article. No sooner were they

met, than it was suggested that the government would lose its dignity for

want of some head who might represent the royal majesty, who might receive

addresses from foreign ambassadors, to whom despatches from English

ministers abroad might be carried, and whose name might be employed in all

orders and proclamations: and as the king’s will seemed to labor under a

defect in this particular, it was deemed necessary to supply it by

choosing a protector; who, though he should possess all the exterior

symbols of royal dignity, should yet be bound, in every act of power, to

follow the opinion of the executors.[**]

 

This proposal was very disagreeable to Chancellor Wriothesely. That

magistrate, a man of an active spirit and high ambition, found himself by

his office entitled to the first rank in the regency after the primate;

and as he knew that this prelate had no talent or inclination for state

affairs, he hoped that the direction of public business would, of course,

devolve in a great measure upon himself. He opposed, therefore, the

proposal of choosing a protector; and represented that innovation as an

infringement of the late king’s will, which, being corroborated by act of

parliament, ought in every thing to be a law to them, and could not be

altered but by the same authority which had established it. But he seems

to have stood alone in the opposition. The executors and counsellors were

mostly courtiers who had been raised by Henry’s favor, not men of high

birth or great hereditary influence; and as they had been sufficiently

accustomed to submission during the reign of the late monarch, and had no

pretensions to govern the nation by their own authority, they acquiesced

the more willingly in a proposal which seemed calculated for preserving

public peace and tranquillity. It being therefore agreed to name a

protector, the choice fell, of course, on the earl of Hertford, who, as he

was the king’s maternal uncle, was strongly interested in his safety; and

possessing no claims to inherit the crown, could never have any separate

interest which might lead him to endanger Edward’s person or his

authority.[*] The public was informed by proclamation of this change in

the administration; and despatches were sent to all foreign courts to give

them intimation of it. All those who were possessed of any office resigned

their former commissions, and accepted new ones in the name of the young

king. The bishops themselves were constrained to make a like submission.

Care was taken to insert in their new commissions, that they held their

office during pleasure:[**] and it is there expressly affirmed, that all

manner of authority and jurisdiction, as well ecclesiastical as civil, is

originally derived from the crown.[***]

 

The executors, in their next measure, showed a more submissive deference

to Henry’s will, because many of them found their account in it. The late

king had intended, before his death, to make a new creation of nobility,

in order to supply the place of those peerages which had fallen by former

attainders, or the failure of issue; and that he might enable the new

peers to support their dignity, he had resolved either to bestow estates

on them, or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone so far as to

inform them of this resolution; and in his will he charged his executors

to make good all his promises.[****] That they might ascertain his

intentions in the most authentic manner Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony

Denny, and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always conversed in a

familiar manner, were called before the board of regency; and having given

evidence of what they knew concerning the king’s promises, their testimony

was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the fulfilling of these

engagements. Hertford was created duke of Somerset, mareschal, and lord

treasurer; Wriothesely, earl of Southampton; the earl of Essex, marquis of

Northampton; Viscount Lisle, earl of Warwick; Sir Thomas Seymour, Lord

Seymour of Sudley, and admiral; Sir Richard Rich, Sir William Willoughby,

Sir Edward Sheffield accepted the title of baron.[v]

 

Several, to whom the same dignity was offered, refused it; because the

other part of the king’s promise, the bestowing of estates on these new

noblemen, was deferred till a more convenient opportunity. Some of them,

however, as also Somerset, the protector, were, in the mean time, endowed

with spiritual preferments, deaneries, and prebends. For, among many other

invasions of ecclesiastical privileges and property, this irregular

practice of bestowing spiritual benefices on laymen began now to prevail.

 

The earl of Southampton had always been engaged in an opposite party to

Somerset; and it was not likely that factions which had secretly prevailed

even during the arbitrary reign of Henry, should be suppressed in the weak

administration that usually attends a minority. The former nobleman, that

he might have the greater leisure for attending to public business, had,

of himself and from his own authority, put the great seal in commission,

and had empowered four lawyers Southwell, Tregonel, Oliver, and Bellasis,

to execute in his absence the office of chancellor. This measure seemed

very exceptionable; and the more so, as, two of the commissioners being

canonists, the lawyers suspected that, by this nomination, the chancellor

had intended to discredit the common law. Complaints were made to the

council, who, influenced by the protector, gladly laid hold of the

opportunity to depress Southampton. They consulted the judges with regard

to so unusual a case; and received for answer, that the commission was

illegal, and that the chancellor, by his presumption in granting it, had

justly forfeited the great seal, and was even liable to punishment. The

council summoned him to appear before them. He maintained that he held his

office by the late king’s will, founded on an act of parliament, and could

not lose it without a trial in parliament; that if the commission which he

had granted were found illegal, it might be cancelled, and all the ill

consequences of it be easily remedied; and that the depriving him of his

office for an error of this nature, was a precedent by which any other

innovation might be authorized. But the council, notwithstanding these

topics of defence, declared that he had forfeited the great seal; that a

fine should be imposed upon him; and that he should be confined to his own

house during pleasure.[*]

 

The removal of Southampton increased the protectors’ authority, as well as

tended to suppress faction in the regency yet was not Somerset contented

with this advantage; his ambition carried him to seek still further

acquisitions. On pretence that the vote of the executors choosing his

protector, was not a sufficient foundation for his authority, he procured

a patent from the young king, by which he entirely overturned the will of

Henry VIII., produced a total revolution in the government, and may seem

even to have subverted all the laws of the kingdom. He named himself

protector with full regal power, and appointed a council, consisting of

all the former counsellors, and all the executors, except Southampton; he

reserved a power of naming any other counsellors at pleasure; and he was

bound to consult with such only as he thought proper. The protector and

his council were likewise empowered to act at discretion, and to execute

whatever they deemed for the public service, without incurring any penalty

or forfeiture from any law, statute, proclamation, or ordinance

whatsoever.[*] Even had this patent been more moderate in its concessions,

and had it been drawn by directions from the executors appointed by Henry,

its legality might justly be questioned; since it seems essential to a

trust of this nature to be exercised by the persons intrusted, and not to

admit of a delegation to others: but as the patent, by its very tenor,

where the executors are not so much as mentioned, appears to have been

surreptitiously obtained from a minor king, the protectorship of Somerset

was a plain usurpation, which it is impossible by any arguments to

justify. The connivance, however, of the executors, and their present

acquiescence in the new establishment, made it be universally submitted

to; and as the young king discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle,

who was also, in the main, a man of moderation and probity, no objections

were made to his power and title. All men of sense, likewise, who saw the

nation divided by the religious zeal of the opposite sects, deemed it the

more necessary to intrust the government to one person, who might check

the exorbitancies of faction, and insure the public tranquillity. And

though some clauses of the patent seemed to imply a formal subversion of

all limited government, so little jealousy was then usually entertained on

that head, that no exception was ever taken at bare claims or pretensions

of this nature, advanced by any person possessed of sovereign power. The

actual exercise alone of arbitrary administration, and that in many, and

great, and flagrant, and unpopular instances, was able sometimes to give

some umbrage to the nation.

 

The extensive authority and imperious character of Henry had retained the

partisans of both religions in subjection; but upon his demise, the hopes

of the Protestants and the fears of the Catholics began to revive, and the

zeal of these parties produced every where disputes and animosities, the

usual preludes to more fatal divisions. The protector had long been

regarded as a secret partisan of the reformers; and being now freed from

restraint, he scrupled not to discover his intention of correcting all

abuses in the ancient religion, and of adopting still more of the

Protestant innovations. He took care that all persons intrusted with the

king’s education should be attached to the same principles; and as the

young prince discovered a zeal for every kind of literature, especially

the theological, far beyond his tender years, all men foresaw, in the

course of his reign, the total abolition of the Catholic faith in England;

and they early began to declare themselves in favor of those tenets, which

were likely to become in the end entirely prevalent. After Southampton’s

fall, few members of the council seemed to retain any attachment to the

Romish communion; and most of the counsellors appeared even sanguine in

forwarding the progress of the reformation. The riches which most of them

had acquired from the spoils of the clergy, induced them to widen the

breach between England and Rome; and by establishing a contrariety of

speculative tenets, as well as of discipline and worship, to render a

coalition with the mother church altogether impracticable.[*] Their

rapacity also, the chief source of their reforming spirit, was excited by

the prospect of pillaging the secular, as they had already done the

regular clergy; and they knew that while any share of the old principles

remained, or any regard to the ecclesiastics, they could never hope to

succeed in that enterprise.

 

The numerous and burdensome superstitions with which the Romish church was

loaded had thrown many of the reformers by the spirit of opposition, into

an enthusiastic strain of devotion; and all rites, ceremonies, pomp,

order, and exterior observances were zealously proscribed by them, as

hinderances to their spiritual contemplations, and obstructions to their

immediate converse with Heaven. Many circumstances concurred to inflame

this daring spirit; the novelty itself of their doctrines, the triumph of

making proselytes, the furious persecutions to which they were exposed,

their animosity against the ancient tenets and practices, and the

necessity of procuring the concurrence of the laity by depressing the

hierarchy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the ecclesiastics.

Wherever the reformation prevailed over the opposition of civil authority,

this genius of religion appeared in its full extent, and was attended with

consequences, which, though less durable, were, for some time, not less

dangerous than those which were connected with the ancient superstition.

But as the magistrate took the lead in England, the transition was more

gradual; much of the ancient religion was still preserved, and a

reasonable degree of subordination was retained in discipline, as well as

some pomp, order, and ceremony in public worship.

 

The protector, in his schemes for advancing the reformation, had always

recourse to the counsels of Cranmer, who, being a man of moderation and

prudence, was averse to all violent changes, and determined to bring over

the people, by insensible innovations, to that system of doctrine and

discipline which he deemed the most pure and perfect. He probably also

foresaw, that a system which carefully avoided the extremes of

reformation, was likely to be most lasting; and that a devotion, merely

spiritual, was fitted only for the first fervors of a new sect, and upon

the relaxation of these naturally gave place to the inroads of

superstition. He seems therefore to have intended the establishment of a

hierarchy, which, being suited to a great and settled government, might

stand as a perpetual barrier against Rome, and might retain the reverence

of the people, even after their enthusiastic zeal was diminished, or

entirely evaporated.

 

The person who opposed with greatest authority any further advances

towards reformation, was Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; who, though he

had not obtained a place in the council of regency, on account of late

disgusts which he had given to Henry, was entitled, by his age,

experience, and capacity, to the highest trust and confidence of his

party. This prelate still continued to magnify the great wisdom and

learning of the late king, which, indeed, were generally and sincerely

revered by the nation; and he insisted on the prudence, of persevering, at

least till the young king’s majority, in the ecclesiastical model

established by that great monarch. He defended the use of images, which

were now openly attacked by the Protestants; and he represented them as

serviceable in maintaining a sense of religion among the illiterate

multitude.[*] He even deigned to write an apology for “holy water,” which

Bishop Ridley had decried in a sermon; and he maintained that, by the

power of the Almighty, it might be rendered an instrument of doing good,

as much as the shadow of St. Peter, the hem of Christ’s garment, or the

spittle and clay laid upon the eyes of the blind.[**] Above all, he

insisted that the laws ought to be observed, that the constitution ought

to be preserved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to follow the will of

the sovereign, in opposition to an act of parliament.[***]

 

But though there remained at that time in England an idea of laws and a

constitution, sufficient at least to furnish a topic of argument to such

as were discontented with any immediate exercise of authority; this plea

could scarcely, in the present case, be maintained with any plausibility

by Gardiner. An act of parliament had invested the crown with a

legislative power; and royal proclamations, even during a minority, were

armed with the force of laws. The protector, finding himself supported by

this statute, was determined to employ his authority in favor of the

reformers; and having suspended, during the interval, the jurisdiction of

the bishops, he appointed a general visitation to be made in all the

dioceses of England.[****] The visitors consisted of a mixture of clergy

and laity, and had six circuits assigned them. The chief purport of their

instructions was, besides correcting immoralities and irregularities in

the clergy, to abolish the ancient superstitions, and to bring the

discipline and worship somewhat nearer the practice of the reformed

churches. The moderation of Somerset and Cranmer is apparent in the

conduct of this delicate affair. The visitors were enjoined to retain for

the present all images which had not been abused to idolatry; and to

instruct the people not to despise such ceremonies as were not yet

abrogated, but only to beware of some particular superstitions, such as

the sprinkling of their beds with holy water, and the ringing of bells, or

using of consecrated candles, in order to drive away the devil.[v]

 

But nothing required more the correcting hand of authority than the abuse

of preaching, which was now generally employed throughout England in

defending the ancient practices and superstitions. The court of

augmentation, in order to ease the exchequer of the annuities paid to

monks, had commonly placed them in the vacant churches; and these men were

led by interest, as well as by inclination, to support those principles

which had been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders therefore

were given to restrain the topics of theft sermons: twelve homilies were

published, which they were enjoined to read to the people: and all of them

were prohibited, without express permission, from preaching any where but

in their parish churches. The purpose of this injunction was to throw a

restraint on the Catholic divines; while the Protestant, by the grant of

particular licenses, should he allowed unbounded liberty. Bonner made some

opposition to these measures; but soon after retracted and acquiesced.

Gardiner was more high-spirited and more steady. He represented the peril

of perpetual innovations, and the necessity of adhering to some system.

“‘Tis a dangerous thing,” said he, “to use too much freedom in researches

of this kind. If you cut the old canal, the water is apt to run farther

than you have a mind to. If you indulge the humor of novelty, you cannot

put a stop to people’s demands, nor govern their indiscretions at

pleasure.” “For my part,” said he, on another occasion “my sole concern

is, to manage the third and last act of my life with decency, and to make

a handsome exit off the stage. Provided this point is secured, I am not

solicitous about the rest. I am already by nature condemned to death: no

man can give me a pardon from this sentence; nor so much as procure me a

reprieve. To speak my mind, and to act as my conscience directs, are two

branches of liberty which I can never part with. Sincerity in speech, and

integrity in action, are entertaining qualities: they will stick by a man

when every thing else takes its leave; and I must not resign them upon any

consideration. The best on it is, if I do not throw them away myself, no

man can force them from me: but if I give them up, then am I ruined by

myself, and deserve to lose all my preferments.”[*] This opposition of

Gardiner drew on him the indignation of the council; and he was sent to

the Fleet, where he was used with some severity.

 

One of the chief objections urged by Gardiner against the new homilies

was, that they defined with the most metaphysical precision the doctrines

of grace, and of justification by faith; points, he thought, which it was

superfluous for any man to know exactly, and which certainly much exceeded

the comprehension of the vulgar. A famous martyrologist calls Gardiner, on

account of this opinion, “an insensible ass, and one that had no feeling

of God’s spirit in the matter of justification.”[*] The meanest Protestant

imagined, at that time, that he had a full comprehension of all those

mysterious doctrines; and he heartily despised the most learned and

knowing person of the ancient religion, who acknowledged his ignorance

with regard to them. It is indeed certain, that the reformers were very

fortunate in their doctrine of justification; and might venture to

foretell its success, in opposition to all the ceremonies, shows, and

superstitions of Popery. By exalting Christ and his sufferings, and

renouncing all claim to independent merit in ourselves, it was calculated

to become popular, and coincided with those principles of panegyric and of

self-abasement which generally have place in religion.

 

Tonstal, bishop of Durham, having, as well as Gardiner, made some

opposition to the new regulations, was dismissed by the council; but no

further severity was for the present exercised against him. He was a man

of great moderation, and of the most unexceptionable character in the

kingdom.

 

The same religious zeal which engaged Somerset to promote the reformation

at home, led him to carry his attention to foreign countries; where the

interests of the Protestants were now exposed to the most imminent danger.

The Roman pontiff, with much reluctance, and after long delays, had at

last summoned a general council, which was assembled at Trent, and was

employed both in correcting the abuses of the church, and in ascertaining

her doctrines. The emperor, who desired to repress the power of the court

of Rome, as well as gain over the Protestants, promoted the former object

of the council; the pope, who found his own greatness so deeply

interested, desired rather to employ them in the latter. He gave

instructions to his legates, who presided in the council, to protract the

debates, and to engage the theologians in argument, and altercation, and

dispute concerning the nice points of faith canvassed before them; a

policy so easy to be executed, that the legates soon found it rather

necessary to interpose, in order to appease the animosity of the divines,

and bring them at last to some decision.[*] The more difficult task for

the legates was, to moderate or divert the zeal of the council for

reformation, and to repress the ambition of the prelates, who desired to

exalt the episcopal authority on the ruins of the sovereign pontiff.

Finding this humor become prevalent, the legates, on pretence that the

plague had broken out at Trent, transferred of a sudden the council to

Bologna, where they hoped it would be more under the direction of his

holiness.

 

The emperor, no less than the pope, had learned to make religion

subservient to his ambition and policy. He was resolved to employ the

imputation of heresy as a pretence for subduing the Protestant princes,

and oppressing the liberties of Germany; but found it necessary to cover

his intentions under deep artifice, and to prevent the combination of his

adversaries. He separated the Palatine and the elector of Brandenburgh

from the Protestant confederacy: he took arms against the elector of

Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse: by the fortune of war he made the

former prisoner: he employed treachery and prevarication against the

latter, and detained him captive, by breaking a safe-conduct which he had

granted him. He seemed to have reached the summit of his ambition; and the

German princes, who were astonished with his success, were further

discouraged by the intelligence which they had received of the death,

first of Henry VIII., then of Francis I., their usual resources in every

calamity.[**]

 

Henry II., who succeeded to the crown of France, was a prince of vigor and

abilities; but less hasty in his resolutions than Francis, and less

inflamed with rivalship and animosity against the emperor Charles. Though

he sent ambassadors to the princes of the Smalcaldic league, and promised

them protection, he was unwilling, in the commencement of his reign, to

hurry into a war with so great a power as that of the emperor; and he

thought that the alliance of those princes was a sure resource, which he

could at any time lay hold of.[***] He was much governed by the duke of

Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine; and he hearkened to their counsel, in

choosing rather to give immediate assistance to Scotland, his ancient

ally, which, even before the death of Henry VIII. had loudly claimed the

protection of the French monarchy.

 

The hatred between the two factions, the partisans of the ancient and

those of the new religion, became every day more violent in Scotland; and

the resolution which the cardinal primate had taken, to employ the most

rigorous punishments against the reformers, brought matters to a quick

decision. There was one Wishart, a gentleman by birth, who employed

himself with great zeal in preaching against the ancient superstitions,

and began to give alarm to the clergy, who were justly terrified with the

danger of some fatal revolution in religion. This man was celebrated for

the purity of his morals, and for his extensive learning; but these

praises cannot be much depended on; because we know that, among the

reformers, severity of manners supplied the place of many virtues; and the

age was in general so ignorant, that most of the priests in Scotland

imagined the New Testament to be a composition of Luther’s, and asserted

that the Old alone was the Word of God.[*] 19 But however the case may

have stood with regard to those estimable qualities ascribed to Wishart,

he was strongly possessed with the desire of innovation; and he enjoyed

those talents which qualified him for becoming a popular preacher, and for

seizing the attention and affections of the multitude. The magistrates of

Dundee, where he exercised his mission, were alarmed with his progress;

and being unable or unwilling to treat him with rigor, they contented

themselves with denying him the liberty of preaching, and with dismissing

him the bounds of their jurisdiction. Wishart, moved with indignation that

they had dared to reject him, together with the word of God, menaced them,

in imitation of the ancient prophets, with some imminent calamity; and he

withdrew to the west country, where he daily increased the number of his

proselytes.

 

Meanwhile, a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed, that the

town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven by banishing the pious

preacher, and that the pestilence would never cease, till they bed made

him atonement for their offence against him. No sooner did Wishart hear of

this change in their disposition, than he returned to them, and made them

a new tender of his doctrine: but lest he should spread the contagion by

bringing them together, he erected his pulpit on the top of a gate; the

infected stood within, the others without. And the preacher failed not, in

such a situation, to take advantage of the immediate terrors of the

people, and to enforce his evangelical mission.[*]

 

The assiduity and success of Wishart became an object of attention to

Cardinal Beatoun; and he resolved, by the punishment of so celebrated a

preacher, to strike a terror into all other innovators. He engaged the

earl of Bothwell to arrest him, and to deliver him into his hands,

contrary to a promise given by Bothwell to that unhappy man; and being

possessed of his prey, he conducted him to St. Andrews, where, after a

trial, he condemned him to the flames for heresy. Arran, the governor, was

irresolute in his temper; and the cardinal, though he had gained him over

to his party, found that he would not concur in the condemnation and

execution of Wishart. He determined, therefore, without the assistance of

the secular arm, to bring that heretic to punishment; and he himself

beheld from his window the dismal spectacle. Wishart suffered with the

usual patience, but could not forbear remarking the triumph of his

insulting enemy. He foretold that, in a few days, he should, in the very

same place, lie as low as now he was exalted aloft in opposition to true

piety and religion.[**]

 

This prophecy was probably the immediate cause of the event which it

foretold. The disciples of this martyr, enraged at the cruel execution,

formed a conspiracy against the cardinal; and having associated to them

Norman Lesly, who was disgusted on account of some private quarrel, they

conducted their enterprise with great secrecy and success. Early in the

morning, they entered the cardinal’s palace, which he had strongly

fortified, and though they were not above sixteen persons, they thrust out

a hundred tradesmen and fifty servants, whom they seized separately,

before any suspicion arose of their intentions; and having shut the gates,

they proceeded very deliberately to execute their purpose on the cardinal.

That prelate had been alarmed with the noise which he heard in the castle,

and had barricadoed the door of his chamber; but finding that they had

brought fire in order to force their way, and having obtained, as is

believed, a promise of life, he opened the door, and reminding them that

he was a priest, he conjured them to spare him. Two of the assassins

rushed upon him with drawn swords; but a third, James Melvil, more calm

and more considerate in villany, stopped their career, and bade them

reflect, that this sacrifice was the work and judgment of God, and ought

to be executed with becoming deliberation and gravity. Then turning the

point of his sword towards Beatoun, he called to him, “Repent thee, thou

wicked cardinal, of all thy sins and iniquities, especially of the murder

of Wishart, that instrument of God for the conversion of these lands: it

is his death which now cries vengeance upon thee: we are sent by God to

inflict the deserved punishment. For here, before the Almighty, I protest

that it is neither hatred of thy person, nor love of thy riches, nor fear

of thy power, which moves me to seek thy death; but only because thou hast

been, and still remainest, an obstinate enemy to Christ Jesus and his holy

gospel.” Having spoken these words, without giving Beatoun time to finish

that repentance to which he exhorted him, he thrust him through the body;

and the cardinal fell dead at his feet.[*] This murder was executed on the

twenty-eighth of May, 1546. The assassins, being reenforced by their

friends to the number of a hundred and forty persons, prepared themselves

for the defence of the castle, and sent a messenger to London craving

assistance from Henry. That prince, though Scotland was comprehended in

his peace with France, would not forego the opportunity of disturbing the

government of a rival kingdom; and he promised to take them under his

protection.

 

It was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five short reigns had

been followed successively by as many long minorities; and the execution

of justice, which the prince was beginning to introduce, had been

continually interrupted by the cabals, factions, and animosities of the

great. But besides these inveterate and ancient evils, a new source of

disorder had arisen, the disputes and contentions of theology which were

sufficient to disturb the most settled government; and the death of the

cardinal, who was possessed of abilities and vigor, seemed much to weaken

the hands of the administration. But the queen dowager was a woman of

uncommon talents and virtue; and she did as much to support the

government, and supply the weakness of Arran, the governor, as could be

expected in her situation.

 

The protector of England, as soon as the state was brought to some

composure, made preparations for war with Scotland; and he was determined

to execute, if possible, that project of uniting the two kingdoms by

marriage, on which the late king had been so intent, and which he had

recommended with his dying breath to his executors. He levied an army of

eighteen thousand men, and equipped a fleet of sixty sail, one half of

which were ships of war, the other laden with provisions and ammunition.

He gave the command of the fleet to Lord Clinton; he himself marched at

the head of the army, attended by the earl of Warwick. These hostile

measures were covered with a pretence of revenging some depredations

committed by the borderers: but besides that Somerset revived the ancient

claim of the superiority of the English crown over that of Scotland, he

refused to enter into negotiation on any other condition than the marriage

of the young queen with Edward.

 

The protector, before he opened the campaign, published a manifesto, in

which he enforced all the arguments for that measure. He said, that nature

seemed originally to have intended this island for one empire, and having

cut it off from all communication with foreign states, and guarded it by

the ocean, she had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to happiness

and to security; that the education and customs of the people concurred

with nature; and, by giving them the same language, and laws, and manners,

had invited them to a thorough union and coalition: that fortune had at

last removed all obstacles, and had prepared an expedient by which they

might become one people, without leaving any place for that jealousy

either of honor or of interest, to which rival nations are naturally

exposed: that the crown of Scotland had devolved on a female; that of

England on a male; and happily the two sovereigns, as of a rank, were also

of an age the most suitable to each other: that the hostile dispositions

which prevailed between the nations, and which arose from past injuries,

would soon be extinguished, after a long and secure peace had established

confidence between them: that the memory of former miseries, which at

present inflamed their mutual animosity, would then serve only to make

them cherish with more passion a state of happiness and tranquillity so

long unknown to their ancestors: that when hostilities had ceased between

the kingdoms, the Scottish nobility, who were at present obliged to remain

perpetually in a warlike posture, would learn to cultivate the arts of

peace, and would soften their minds to a love of domestic order and

obedience: that as this situation was desirable to both kingdoms, so

particularly to Scotland, which had been exposed to the greatest miseries

from intestine and foreign wars, and saw herself every moment in danger of

losing her independency by the efforts of a richer and more powerful

people: that though England had claims of superiority, she was willing to

resign every pretension for the sake of future peace; and desired a union

which would be the more secure, as it would be concluded on terms entirely

equal; and that, besides all these motives, positive engagements had been

taken for completing this alliance; and the honor and good faith of the

nation were pledged to fulfil what her interest and safety so loudly

demanded.[*]

 

Somerset soon perceived that these remonstrances would have no influence;

and that the queen dowager’s attachment to France and to the Catholic

religion would render ineffectual all negotiations for the intended

marriage. He found himself, therefore, obliged to try the force of arms,

and to constrain the Scots by necessity to submit to a measure for which

they seemed to have entertained the most incurable aversion. He passed the

borders at Berwick, and advanced towards Edinburgh, without meeting any

resistance for some days, except from some small castles, which he obliged

to surrender at discretion. The protector intended to have punished the

governor and garrison of one of these castles for their temerity in

resisting such unequal force: but they eluded his anger by asking only a

few hours’ respite, till they should prepare themselves for death; after

which they found his ears more open to their applications for mercy.[**]

 

The governor of Scotland had summoned together the whole force of the

kingdom; and his army, double in number to that of the English, had taken

post on advantageous ground, guarded by the banks of the Eske, about four

miles from Edinburgh. The English came within sight of them at Faside; and

after a skirmish between the horse, where the Scots were worsted, and Lord

Hume dangerously wounded, Somerset prepared himself for a more decisive

action. But having taken a view of the Scottish camp with the earl of

Warwick, he found it difficult to make an attempt upon it with any

probability of success. He wrote, therefore, another letter to Arran; and

offered to evacuate the kingdom, as well as to repair all the damages

which he had committed, provided the Scots would stipulate not to contract

the queen to any foreign prince, but to detain her at home till she

reached the age of choosing a husband for herself. So moderate a demand

was rejected by the Scots merely on account of its moderation; and it made

them imagine that the protector must either be reduced to great distress,

or be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to abate so much of

his former pretensions. Inflamed also by their priests, who had come to

the camp in great numbers, they believed that the English were detestable

heretics, abhorred of God, and exposed to divine vengeance; and that no

success could ever crown their arms. They were confirmed in this fond

conceit when they saw the protector change his ground, and move towards

the sea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended to embark his

army, and make his escape on board the ships which at that very time moved

into the bay opposite to him.[*] Determined therefore to cut off his

retreat, they quitted their camp; and passing the River Eske, advanced

into the plain. They were divided into three bodies: Angus commanded the

vanguard; Arran the main body; Huntley the rear: their cavalry consisted

only of light horse, which were placed on their left flank, strengthened

by some Irish archers whom Argyle had brought over for this service.

 

Somerset was much pleased when he saw this movement of the Scottish army;

and as the English had usually been superior in pitched battles, he

conceived great hopes of success. He ranged his van on the left, farthest

from the sea; and ordered them to remain on the high grounds on which he

placed them, till the enemy should approach: he placed his main battle and

his rear towards the right; and beyond the van he posted Lord Grey at the

head of the men at arms, and ordered him to take the Scottish van in

flank, but not till they should be engaged in close fight with the van of

the English.

 

While the Scots were advancing on the plain, they were galled with the

artillery from the English ships: the eldest son of Lord Graham was

killed: the Irish archers were thrown into disorder; and even the other

troops began to stagger; when Lord Grey, perceiving their situation,

neglected his orders, left his ground, and at the head of his heavy-armed

horse made an attack on the Scottish infantry, in hopes of gaining all the

honor of the victory. On advancing, he found a slough and ditch in his

way; and behind were ranged the enemy armed with spears, and the field on

which they stood was fallow ground, broken with ridges which lay across

their front, and disordered the movements of the English cavalry. From all

these accidents, the shock of this body of horse was feeble and irregular;

and as they were received on the points of the Scottish spears, which were

longer than the lances of the English horsemen, they were in a moment

pierced, over-thrown, and discomfited. Grey himself was dangerously

wounded: Lord Edward Seymour, son of the protector, had his horse killed

under him: the standard was near being taken: and had the Scots possessed

any good body of cavalry, who could have pursued the advantage, the whole

English army had been exposed to great danger.[*]

 

The protector, meanwhile, assisted by Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir Ralph Vane,

employed himself with diligence and success in rallying the cavalry.

Warwick showed great presence of mind in maintaining the ranks of the

foot, on which the horse had recoiled: he made Sir Peter Meutas advance,

captain of the foot harquebusiers, and Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of some

Italian and Spanish harquebusiers on horseback; and ordered them to ply

the Scottish infantry with their shot. They marched to the slough, and

discharged their pieces full in the face of the enemy: the ships galled

them from the flank: the artillery, planted on a height, infested them

from the front: the English archers poured in a shower of arrows upon

them: and the vanguard, descending from the hill, advanced leisurely and

in good order towards them. Dismayed with all these circumstances, the

Scottish van began to retreat: the retreat soon changed into a flight,

which was begun by the Irish archers. The panic of the van communicated

itself to the main body, and passing thence to the rear, rendered the

whole field a scene of confusion, terror, flight, and consternation. The

English army perceived from the heights the condition of the Scots, and

began the pursuit with loud shouts and acclamations, which added still

more to the dismay of the vanquished. The horse in particular, eager to

revenge the affront which they had received in the beginning of the day,

did the most bloody execution on the flying enemy; and from the field of

battle to Edinburgh, for the space of five miles, the whole ground was

strowed with dead bodies. The priests, above all, and the monks, received

no quarter; and the English made sport of slaughtering men who, from their

extreme zeal and animosity, had engaged in an enterprise so ill befitting

their profession. Few victories have been more decisive, or gained with

smaller loss to the conquerors. There fell not two hundred of the English;

and according to the most moderate computation, there perished above ten

thousand of the Scots. About fifteen hundred were taken prisoners. This

action was called the battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman’s seat of that

name in the neighborhood.

 

The queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and were scarcely able to

collect such a body of forces as could check the incursions of small

parties of the English. About the same time, the earl of Lenox and Lord

Wharton entered the west marches, at the head of five thousand men; and

after taking and plundering Annan, they spread devastation over all the

neighboring counties.[*] Had Somerset prosecuted his advantages, he might

have imposed what terms he pleased on the Scottish nation: but he was

impatient to return to England, where, he heard, some counsellors, and

even his own brother, the admiral, were carrying on cabals against his

authority. Having taking the castles of Hume, Dunglass, Eymouth,

Fastcastle, Roxborough, and some other small places, and having received

the submission of some counties on the borders, he retired from Scotland.

The fleet, besides destroying all the shipping along the coast, took

Broughty, in the Frith of Tay; and having fortified it, they there left a

garrison. Arran desired leave to send commissioners in order to treat of a

peace; and Somerset, having appointed Berwick for the place of conference,

left Warwick with full powers to negotiate: but no commissioners from

Scotland ever appeared. The overture of the Scots was an artifice, to gain

time till succors should arrive from France.

 

The protector, on his arrival in England, summoned a parliament: and being

somewhat elated with his success against the Scots, he procured from his

nephew a patent, appointing him to sit on the throne, upon a stool or

bench at the right hand of the king, and to enjoy the same honors and

privileges that had usually been possessed by any prince of the blood, or

uncle of the kings of England. In this patent the king employed his

dispensing power, by setting aside the statute of precedency enacted

during the former reign.[*] But if Somerset gave offence by assuming too

much state, he deserves great praise on account of the laws passed this

session, by which the rigor of former statutes was much mitigated, and

some security given to the freedom of the constitution. All laws were

repealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the

twenty-fifth of Edward III.;[**] all laws enacted during the late reign

extending the crime of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or

heresy, together with the statute of the six articles. None were to be

accused for words, but within a month after they were spoken. By these

repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed in England

were annulled; and some dawn, both of civil and religious liberty, began

to appear to the people. Heresy, however, was still a capital crime by the

common law, and was subjected to the penalty of burning. Only there

remained no precise standard by which that crime could be defined or

determined; a circumstance which might either be advantageous or hurtful

to public security, according to the disposition of the judges.

 

A repeal also passed of that law, the destruction of all laws, by which

the king’s proclamation was made of equal force with a statute.[***] That

other law, likewise, was mitigated, by which the king was empowered to

annul every statute passed before the four-and-twentieth year of his age:

he could prevent their future execution; but could not recall any past

effects which had ensued from them.[****]

 

It was also enacted, that all who denied the king’s supremacy, or asserted

the pope’s, should, for the first offence, forfeit their goods and

chattels, and suffer imprisonment during pleasure; for the second offence,

should incur the penalty of a “prÃ¦munire;” and for the third, be attainted

of treason. But if any, after the first of March ensuing, endeavored, by

writing, printing, or any overt act or deed, to deprive the king of his

estate or titles, particularly of his supremacy, or to confer them on any

other, he was to be adjudged guilty of treason. If any of the heirs of the

crown should usurp upon another, or endeavor to break the order of

succession, it was declared treason in them, their aiders and abettors.

These were the most considerable acts passed during this session. The

members in general discovered a very passive disposition with regard to

religion: some few appeared zealous for the reformation: others secretly

harbored a strong propensity to the Catholic faith: but the greater part

appeared willing to take any impression which they should receive from

interest authority, or the reigning fashion.[*]

 

The convocation met at the same time with the parliament and as it was

found that their debates were at first cramped by the rigorous statute of

the six articles, the king granted them a dispensation from that law,

before it was repealed by parliament.[**] The lower house of convocation

applied to have liberty of sitting with the commons in parliament; or if

this privilege were refused them, which they claimed as their ancient

right, they desired that no law regarding religion might pass in

parliament without their consent and approbation. But the principles which

now prevailed were more favorable to the civil than to the ecclesiastical

power; and this demand of the convocation was rejected.

 

1548.

 

The protector had assented to the repeal of that law which gave to the

king’s proclamations the authority of statutes; but he did not intend to

renounce that arbitrary or discretionary exercise of power, in issuing

proclamations, which had ever been assumed by the crown, and which it is

difficult to distinguish exactly from a full legislative power. He even

continued to exert this authority in some particulars, which were then

regarded as the most momentous. Orders were issued by council, that

candles should no longer be carried about on Candlemas day, ashes on Ash

Wednesday, palms on Palm Sunday.[***]

 

These were ancient religious practices, now termed superstitions; though

it is fortunate for mankind, when superstition happens to take a direction

so innocent and inoffensive. The severe disposition which naturally

attends all reformers prompted likewise the council to abolish some gay

and showy ceremonies which belonged to the ancient religion.[*]

 

An order was also issued by council for the removal of all images from the

churches; an innovation which was much desired by the reformers, and which

alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almost to a total change of

the established religion.[**] An attempt had been made to separate the use

of images from their abuse, the reverence from the worship of them; but

the execution of this design was found, upon trial, very difficult, if not

wholly impracticable.

 

As private masses were abolished by law, it became necessary to compose a

new communion service; and the council went so far, in the preface which

they prefixed to this work, as to leave the practice of auricular

confession wholly indifferent.[***] This was a prelude to the entire

abolition of that invention, one of the most powerful engines that ever

was contrived for degrading the laity, and giving their spiritual guides

an entire ascendant over them. And it may justly be said, that, though the

priest’s absolution, which attends confession, serves somewhat to ease

weak minds from the immediate agonies of superstitious terror, it operates

only by enforcing superstition itself, and thereby preparing the mind for

a more violent relapse into the same disorders.

 

The people were at that time extremely distracted by the opposite opinions

of their preachers; and as they were totally unable to judge of the

reasons advanced on either side, and naturally regarded every thing which

they heard at church as of equal authority, a great confusion and

fluctuation resulted from this uncertainty. The council had first

endeavored to remedy the inconvenience by laying some restraints on

preaching; but finding this expedient ineffectual, they imposed a total

silence on the preachers, and thereby put an end at once to all the

polemics of the pulpit.[****] By the nature of things, this restraint

could only be temporary. For in proportion as the ceremonies of public

worship, its shows and exterior observances, were retrenched by the

reformers, the people were inclined to contract a stronger attachment to

sermons, whence alone they received any occupation or amusement. The

ancient religion, by giving its votaries something to do, freed them from

the trouble of thinking: sermons were delivered only in the principal

churches, and at some particular fasts and festivals: and the practice of

haranguing the populace, which, if abused, is so powerful an incitement to

faction and sedition, had much less scope and influence during those ages.

 

The greater progress was made towards a reformation in England, the

farther did the protector find himself from all prospect of completing the

union with Scotland; and the queen dowager, as well as the clergy, became

the more averse to all alliance with a nation which had so far departed

from all ancient principles. Somerset, having taken the town of

Haddington, had ordered it to be strongly garrisoned and fortified by Lord

Grey: he also erected some fortifications at Lauder; and he hoped that

these two places, together with Broughty and some smaller fortresses which

were in the hands of the English, would serve as a curb on Scotland, and

would give him access into the heart of the country.

 

Arran, being disappointed in some attempts on Broughty, relied chiefly on

the succors expected from France for the recovery of these places; and

they arrived at last in the frith, to the number of six thousand men; half

of them Germans. They were commanded by DessÃ©, and under him by Andelot,

Strozzi, Meilleraye, and Count Rhingrave. The Scots were at that time so

sunk by their misfortunes, that five hundred English horse were able to

ravage the whole country without resistance, and make inroads to the gates

of the capital:[*] but on the appearance of the French succors, they

collected more courage; and having joined DessÃ© with a considerable

reÃ«nforcement, they laid siege to Haddington.[**] This was an undertaking

for which they were by themselves totally unfit; and even with the

assistance of the French, they placed their chief hopes of success in

starving the garrison. After some vain attempts to take the place by a

regular siege, the blockade was formed, and the garrison was repulsed with

loss in several sallies which they made upon the besiegers.

 

The hostile attempts which the late king and the protector had made

against Scotland, not being steady, regular, nor pushed to the last

extremity, had served only to imitate the nation, and to inspire them with

the strongest aversion to that union which was courted in so violent a

manner. Even those who were inclined to the English alliance were

displeased to have it imposed on them by force of arms; and the earl of

Huntley in particular said, pleasantly, that he disliked not the match,

but he hated the manner of wooing.[*] The queen dowager, finding these

sentiments to prevail, called a parliament in an abbey near Haddington;

and it was there proposed that the young queen, for her greater security,

should be sent to France, and be committed to the custody of that ancient

ally. Some objected that this measure was desperate, allowed no resource

in case of miscarriage, exposed the Scots to be subjected by foreigners,

involved them in perpetual war with England, and left them no expedient by

which they could conciliate the friendship of that powerful nation. It was

answered, on the other hand, that the queen’s presence was the very cause

of war with England; that that nation would desist when they found that

their views of forcing a marriage had become altogether impracticable; and

that Henry, being engaged by so high a mark of confidence, would take

their sovereign under his protection, and use his utmost efforts to defend

the kingdom. These arguments were aided by French gold, which was

plentifully distributed among the nobles. The governor had a pension

conferred on him of twelve thousand livres a year, received the title of

duke of Chatelrault, and obtained for his son the command of a hundred men

at arms.[**] And as the clergy dreaded the consequences of the English

alliance, they seconded this measure with all the zeal and industry which

either principle or interest could inspire. It was accordingly determined

to send the queen to France; and, what was understood to be the necessary

consequence, to marry her to the dauphin. Villegaignon, commander of four

French galleys lying in the Frith of Forth, set sail as if he intended to

return home; but when he reached the open sea he turned northwards, passed

by the Orkneys, and came in on the west coast at Dunbarton; an

extraordinary voyage for ships of that fabric.[***] The young queen was

there committed to him; and, being attended by the lords Ereskine and

Livingstone, she put to sea, and, after meeting with some tempestuous

weather, arrived safely at Brest, whence she was conducted to Paris, and

soon after she was betrothed to the dauphin.

 

Somerset, pressed by many difficulties at home and despairing of success

in his enterprise against Scotland, was desirous of composing the

differences with that kingdom, and he offered the Scots a ten years’

truce; but as they insisted on his restoring all the places which he had

taken, the proposal came to nothing. The Scots recovered the fortresses of

Hume and Fastcastle by surprise, and put the garrisons to the sword: they

repulsed with loss the English, who, under the command of Lord Seymour,

made a descent, first in Fife, then at Montrose: in the former action,

James Stuart, natural brother to the queen, acquired honor; in the latter,

Ereskine of Dun. An attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas

Palmer, at the head of a considerable body, to throw relief into

Haddington; but these troops, falling into an ambuscade, were almost

wholly cut in pieces.[*] And though a small body of two hundred men

escaped all the vigilance of the French, and arrived safely in Haddington

with some ammunition and provisions, the garrison was reduced to such

difficulties, that the protector found it necessary to provide more

effectually for their relief. He raised an army of eighteen thousand men,

and adding three thousand Germans, who, on the dissolution of the

Protestant alliance, had offered their service to England, he gave the

command of the whole to the earl of Shrewsbury.[**] DessÃ© raised the

blockade on the approach of the English; and with great difficulty made

good his retreat to Edinburgh, where he posted himself advantageously.

Shrewsbury, who had lost the opportunity of attacking him on his march,

durst not give him battle in his present situation; and contenting himself

with the advantage already gained of supplying Haddington, he retired into

England.

 

Though the protection of France was of great consequence to the Scots in

supporting them against the invasions of England, they reaped still more

benefit from the distractions and divisions which have crept into the

councils of this latter kingdom. Even the two brothers, the protector and

admiral, not content with the high stations which they severally enjoyed,

and the great eminence to which they had risen, had entertained the most

violent jealousy of each other; and they divided the whole court and

kingdom by their opposite cabals and pretensions. Lord Seymour was a man

of insatiable ambition; arrogant, assuming, implacable; and though

esteemed of superior capacity to the protector, he possessed not to the

same degree the confidence and regard of the people. By his flattery and

address, he had so insinuated himself into the good graces of the queen

dowager, that, forgetting her usual prudence and decency, she married him

immediately upon the demise of the late king; insomuch that, had she soon

proved pregnant, it might have been doubtful to which husband the child

belonged. The credit and riches of this alliance supported the ambition of

the admiral, but gave umbrage to the duchess of Somerset, who, uneasy that

the younger brother’s wife should have the precedency, employed all her

credit with her husband, which was too great, first to create, then to

widen the breach between the two brothers.[*]

 

The first symptoms of this misunderstanding appeared when the protector

commanded the army in Scotland. Secretary Paget, a man devoted to

Somerset, remarked that Seymour was forming separate intrigues among the

counsellors; was corrupting by presents the king’s servants; and even

endeavoring, by improper indulgences and liberalities, to captivate the

affections of the young monarch. Paget represented to him the danger of

this conduct; desired him to reflect on the numerous enemies whom the

sudden elevation of their family had created; and warned him, that any

dissension between him and the protector would be greedily laid hold of to

effect the ruin of both. Finding his remonstrances neglected, he conveyed

intelligence of the danger to Somerset, and engaged him to leave the

enterprise upon Scotland unfinished, in order to guard against the

attempts of his domestic enemies. In the ensuing parliament, the admiral’s

projects appeared still more dangerous to public tranquillity; and as he

had acquired many partisans, he made a direct attack upon his brother’s

authority. He represented to his friends, that formerly, during a

minority, the office of protector of the kingdom had been kept separate

from that of governor of the king’s person; and that the present union of

these two important trusts conferred on Somerset an authority which could

not safely be lodged in any subject.[*] The young king was even prevailed

on to write a letter to the parliament desiring that Seymour might be

appointed his governor; and that nobleman had formed a party in the two

houses, by which he hoped to effect his purpose. The design was discovered

before its execution; and some common friends were sent to remonstrate

with him, but had so little influence, that he threw out many menacing

expressions, and rashly threatened that, if he were thwarted in his

attempt, he would make this parliament the blackest that ever sat in

England.[**] The council sent for him to answer for his conduct; but he

refused to attend: they then began to threaten in their turn, and informed

him that the king’s letter, instead of availing him any thing to the

execution of his views, would be imputed to him as a criminal enterprise,

and be construed as a design to disturb the government, by forming a

separate interest with a child and minor. They even let fall some menaces

of sending him to the Tower for his temerity; and the admiral, finding

himself prevented in his design, was obliged to submit, and to desire a

reconciliation with his brother.

 

The mild and moderate temper of Somerset made him willing to forget these

enterprises of the admiral; but the ambition of that turbulent spirit

could not be so easily appeased. His spouse, the queen dowager, died in

childbed; but so far from regarding this event as a check to his aspiring

views, he founded on it the scheme of a more extraordinary elevation. He

made his addresses to the lady Elizabeth, then in the sixteenth year of

her age; and that princess, whom even the hurry of business and the

pursuits of ambition could not, in her more advanced years, disengage

entirely from the tender passions, seems to have listened to the

insinuations of a man who possessed every talent proper to captivate the

affections of the fair.[***]

 

But as Henry VIII. had excluded his daughters from all hopes of succession

if they married without the consent of his executors, which Seymour could

never hope to obtain, it was concluded that he meant to effect his purpose

by expedients still more rash and more criminal. All the other measures of

the admiral tended to confirm this suspicion. He continued to attack, by

presents, the fidelity of those who had more immediate access to the

king’s person: he endeavored to seduce the young prince into his interest,

he found means of holding a private correspondence with him; he openly

decried his brother’s administration; and asserted that, by enlisting

Germans and other foreigners he intended to form a mercenary army, which

might endanger the king’s authority, and the liberty of the people: by

promises and persuasion he brought over to his party many of the principal

nobility; and had extended his interest all over England: he neglected not

even the most popular persons of inferior rank; and had computed that he

could, on occasion, muster an army of ten thousand men, composed of his

servants, tenants, and retainers:[*] he had already provided arms for

their use; and having engaged in his interests Sir John Sharington, a

corrupt man, master of the mint at Bristol, he flattered himself that

money would not be wanting. Somerset was well apprised of all these

alarming circumstances, and endeavored, by the most friendly expedients,

by entreaty, reason, and even by heaping new favors upon the admiral, to

make him desist from his dangerous counsels: but finding all endeavors

ineffectual, he began to think of more severe remedies. The earl of

Warwick was an ill instrument between the brothers; and had formed the

design, by inflaming the quarrel, to raise his own fortune on the ruins of

both.

 

Dudley, earl of Warwick, was the son of that Dudley, minister to Henry

VII., who, having, by rapine, extortion, and perversion of law, incurred

the hatred of the public, had been sacrificed to popular animosity in the

beginning of the subsequent reign. The late king, sensible of the

iniquity, at least illegality, of the sentence, had afterwards restored

young Dudley’s blood by act of parliament; and finding him endowed with

abilities, industry, and activity, he had intrusted him with many

important commands, and had ever found him successful in his undertakings.

He raised him to the dignity of Viscount Lisle, conferred on him the

office of admiral, and gave him by his will a place among his executors.

Dudley made still further progress during the minority; and having

obtained the title of earl of Warwick, and undermined the credit of

Southampton, he bore the chief rank among the protector’s counsellors. The

victory gained at Pinkey was much ascribed to his courage and conduct; and

he was universally regarded as a man equally endowed with the talents of

peace and of war. But all these virtues were obscured by still greater

vices; an exorbitant ambition, an insatiable avarice, a neglect of

decency, a contempt of justice: and as he found that Lord Seymour, whose

abilities and enterprising spirit he chiefly dreaded, was involving

himself in ruin by his rash counsels, he was determined to push him on the

precipice, and thereby remove the chief obstacle to his own projected

greatness.

 

When Somerset found that the public peace was endangered by his brother’s

seditious, not to say rebellious schemes, he was the more easily persuaded

by Warwick to employ the extent of royal authority against him; and after

depriving him of the office of admiral, he signed a warrant for committing

him to the Tower. Some of his accomplices were also taker into custody;

and three privy counsellors, being sent to examine them, made a report,

that they had met with very full and important discoveries. Yet still the

protector suspended the blow, and showed a reluctance to ruin his brother.

He offered to desist from the prosecution, if Seymour would promise him a

cordial reconciliation, and, renouncing all ambitious hopes, be contented

with a private life, and retire into the country. But as Seymour made no

other answer to these friendly offers than menaces and defiances, he

ordered a charge to be drawn up against him, consisting of thirty-three

articles;[*] and the whole to be laid before the privy council. It is

pretended, that every particular was so incontestably proved, both by

witnesses and his own handwriting, that there was no room for doubt; yet

did the council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in order more

fully to examine the prisoner. He was not daunted by the appearance: he

boldly demanded a fair trial; required to be confronted with the

witnesses; desired that the charge might be left with him, in order to be

considered; and refused to answer any interrogatories by which he might

accuse himself.

 

It is apparent that, notwithstanding what is pretended, there must have

been some deficiency in the evidence against Seymour, when such demands,

founded on the plainest principles of law and equity, were absolutely

rejected. We shall indeed conclude, if we carefully examine the charge,

that many of the articles were general, and scarcely capable of any proof

many of them, if true, susceptible of a more favorable interpretation; and

that though, on the whole, Seymour appears to have been a dangerous

subject, he had not advanced far in those treasonable projects imputed to

him. The chief part of his actual guilt seems to have consisted in some

unwarrantable practices in the admiralty, by which pirates were protected

and illegal impositions laid upon the merchants.

 

But the administration had at that time an easy instrument of vengeance,

to wit, the parliament; and needed not to give themselves any concern with

regard either to the guilt of the persons whom they prosecuted, or the

evidence which could be produced against them. A session of parliament

being held, it was resolved to proceed against Seymour by bill of

attainder; and the young king being induced, after much solicitation, to

give his consent to it, a considerable weight was put on his approbation.

The matter was first laid before the upper house; and several peers,

rising up in their places, gave an account of what they knew concerning

Lord Seymour’s conduct, and his criminal words or actions.

 

1549.

 

These narratives were received as undoubted evidence; and though the

prisoner had formerly engaged many friends and partisans among the

nobility, no one had either the courage or equity to move, that he might

be heard in his defence, that the testimony against him should be

delivered in a legal manner, and that he should be confronted with the

witnesses. A little more scruple was made in the house of commons: there

were even some members who objected against the whole method of proceeding

by bill of attainder passed in absence; and insisted, that a formal trial

should be given to every man before his condemnation. But when a message

was sent by the king, enjoining the house to proceed, and offering that

the same narratives should be laid before them which had satisfied the

peers, they were easily prevailed on to acquiesce.[*] The bill passed in a

full house. Near four hundred voted for it; not above nine or ten against

it.[**] The sentence was soon after executed, and the prisoner was

beheaded on Tower Hill. The warrant was signed by Somerset, who was

exposed to much blame, on account of the violence of these proceedings.

The attempts of the admiral seem chiefly to have been levelled against his

brother’s usurped authority; and though his ambitious, enterprising

character, encouraged by a marriage with the lady Elizabeth, might have

endangered the public tranquillity, the prudence of foreseeing evils at

such a distance was deemed too great, and the remedy was plainly illegal.

It could only be said, that this bill of attainder was somewhat more

tolerable than the preceding ones, to which the nation had been inured;

for here, at least, some shadow of evidence was produced.

 

All the considerable business transacted this session, besides the

attainder of Lord Seymour, regarded ecclesiastical affairs, which were now

the chief object of attention throughout the nation. A committee of

bishops and divines had been appointed by the council to compose a

liturgy; and they had executed the work committed to them. They proceeded

with moderation in this delicate undertaking; they retained as much of the

ancient mass as the principles of the reformers would permit: they

indulged nothing to the spirit of contradiction, which so naturally takes

place in all great innovations: and they flattered themselves, that they

had established a service in which every denomination of Christians might

without scruple concur. The mass had always been celebrated in Latin; a

practice which might have been deemed absurd, had it not been found useful

to the clergy, by impressing the people with an idea of some mysterious

unknown virtue in those rites, and by checking all their pretensions to be

familiarly acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers pretended

in some few particulars to encourage private judgment in the laity, the

translation of the liturgy, as well as of the Scriptures, into the vulgar

tongue, seemed more conformable to the genius of their sect; and this

innovation, with the retrenching of prayers to saints, and of some

superstitious ceremonies, was the chief difference between the old mass

and the new liturgy. The parliament established this form of worship in

all the churches, and ordained a uniformity to be observed in all the

rites and ceremonies.[*]

 

There was another material act which passed this session. The former

canons had established the celibacy of the clergy; and though this

practice is usually ascribed to the policy of the court of Rome, who

thought that the ecclesiastics would be more devoted to their spiritual

head, and less dependent on the civil magistrate, when freed from the

powerful tie of wives and children, yet was this institution much

forwarded by the principles of superstition inherent in human nature.

These principles had rendered the panegyrics on an inviolate chastity so

frequent among the ancient fathers, long before the establishment of

celibacy. And even this parliament, though they enacted a law permitting

the marriage of priests, yet confess in the preamble, “that it were better

for priests and the ministers of the church to live chaste and without

marriage, and it were much to be wished they would of themselves abstain.”

The inconveniences which had arisen from the compelling of chastity and

the prohibiting of marriage, are the reasons assigned for indulging a

liberty in this particular.[*] The ideas of penance also were so much

retained in other particulars, that an act of parliament passed,

forbidding the use of flesh meat during Lent and other times of

abstinence.[**] 20
 

The principal tenets and practices of the Catholic religion were now

abolished, and the reformation, such as it is enjoyed at present, was

almost entirely completed in England. But the doctrine of the real

presence, though tacitly condemned by the new communion service, and by

the abolition of many ancient rites, still retained some hold on the minds

of men: and it was the last doctrine of Popery that was wholly abandoned

by the people.[***] The great attachment of the late king to that tenet

might, in part, be the ground of this obstinacy: but the chief cause was

really the extreme absurdity of the principle itself, and the profound

veneration, which, of course, it impressed on the imagination. The

priests, likewise, were much inclined to favor an opinion which attributed

to them so miraculous a power; and the people, who believed that they

participated of the very body and blood of their Savior, were loath to

renounce so extraordinary, and, as they imagined, so salutary a privilege.

The general attachment to this dogma was so violent, that the Lutherans,

notwithstanding their separation from Rome, had thought proper, under

another name, still to retain it; and the Catholic preachers in England,

when restrained in all other particulars, could not forbear, on every

occasion, inculcating that tenet. Bonner, for this offence among others,

had been tried by the council, had been deprived of his see, and had been

committed to custody. Gardiner, also, who had recovered his liberty,

appeared anew refractory to the authority which established the late

innovations; and he seemed willing to countenance that opinion, much

favored by all the English Catholics, that the king was indeed supreme

head of the church, but not the council during a minority. Having declined

to give full satisfaction on this head, he was sent to the Tower, and

threatened with further effects of the council’s displeasure.

 

These severities, being exercised on men possessed of office and

authority, seemed in that age a necessary policy, in order to enforce a

uniformity in public worship and discipline; but there were other

instances of persecution, derived from no origin but the bigotry of

theologians; a malady which seems almost incurable. Though the Protestant

divines had ventured to renounce opinions deemed certain during many ages,

they regarded, in their turn, the new system as so certain, that they

would suffer no contradiction with regard to it; and they were ready to

burn in the same flames from which they themselves had so narrowly

escaped, every one that had the assurance to differ from them. A

commission, by act of council, was granted to the primate and some others,

to examine and search after all Anabaptists, heretics, or contemners of

the Book of Common Prayer.[*]

 

The commissioners were enjoined to reclaim them, if possible; to impose

penance on them, and to give them absolution; or, if these criminals were

obstinate, to excommunicate and imprison them, and to deliver them over to

the secular arm: and in the execution of this charge, they were not bound

to observe the ordinary methods of trial; the forms of law were dispensed

with; and if any statutes happened to interfere with the powers in the

commission, they were overruled and abrogated by the council. Some

tradesmen in London were brought before these commissioners, and were

accused of maintaining, among other opinions, that a man regenerate could

not sin, and that, though the outward man might offend, the inward was

incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed on to abjure, and were

dismissed. But there was a woman accused of heretical pravity, called Joan

Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who was so pertinacious, that the commissioners

could make no impression upon her Her doctrine was, “that Christ was not

truly incarnate of the Virgin, whose flesh, being the outward man, was

sinfully begotten, and born in sin, and, consequently, he could take none

of it; but the Word, by the consent of the inward man of the Virgin, was

made flesh.”[*] This opinion, it would seem, is not orthodox; and there

was a necessity for delivering the woman to the flames for maintaining it.

But the young king, though in such tender years, had more sense than all

his counsellors and preceptors; and he long refused to sign the warrant

for her execution. Cranmer was employed to persuade him to compliance; and

he said, that there was a great difference between errors in other points

of divinity, and those which were in direct contradiction to the apostles’

creed: these latter were impieties against God, which the prince, being

God’s deputy, ought to repress, in like manner, as inferior magistrates

were bound to punish offences against the king’s person. Edward, overcome

by importunity, at last submitted, though with tears in his eyes; and he

told Cranmer, that if any wrong were done, the guilt should lie entirely

on his head. The primate, after making a new effort to reclaim the woman

from her errors, and finding her obstinate against all his arguments, at

last committed her to the flames. Some time after, a Dutchman, called Van

Paris, accused of the heresy which has received the name of Arianism, was

condemned to the same punishment. He suffered with so much satisfaction,

that he hugged and caressed the fagots that were consuming him; a species

of frenzy of which there is more than one instance among the martyrs of

that age.[**]

 

These rigorous methods of proceeding soon brought the whole nation to a

conformity, seeming or real, with the new doctrine and the new liturgy.

The lady Mary alone continued to adhere to the mass, and refused to admit

the established modes of worship. When pressed and menaced on this head,

she applied to the emperor, who, using his interest with Sir Philip Hobby,

the English ambassador, procured her a temporary connivance from the

council.[***
