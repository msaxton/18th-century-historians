The violent party which had taken arms against Edward II., and finally

      deposed that unfortunate monarch, deemed it requisite for their future

      security to pay so far an exterior obeisance to the law, as to desire a

      parliamentary indemnity for all their illegal proceedings; on account of

      the necessity which, it was pretended, they lay under, of employing force

      against the Spensers and other evil counsellors, enemies of the kingdom.

      All the attainders, also, which had passed against the earl of Lancaster

      and his adherents, when the chance of war turned against them, were easily

      reversed during the triumph of their party;[*] and the Spensers, whose

      former attainder had been reversed by parliament, were now again, in this

      change of fortune, condemned by the votes of their enemies.

     

      A council of regency was likewise appointed by parliament, consisting of

      twelve persons; five prelates, the archbishops of Canterbury and York, the

      bishops of Winchester, Worcester, and Hereford; and seven lay peers, the

      earls of Norfolk, Kent, and Surrey, and the lords Wake, Ingham, Piercy,

      and Ross. The earl of Lancaster was appointed guardian and protector of

      the king’s person. But though it was reasonable to expect that, as the

      weakness of the former king had given reins to the licentiousness of the

      barons, great domestic tranquillity would not prevail during the present

      minority; the first disturbance arose from an invasion by foreign enemies.

     

      The king of Scots, declining in years and health, but retaining still that

      martial spirit which had raised his nation from the lowest ebb of fortune,

      deemed the present opportunity favorable for infesting England. He first

      made an attempt on the Castle of Norham, in which he was disappointed; he

      then collected an army of twenty-five thousand men on the frontiers, and

      having given the command to the earl of Murray and Lord Douglas,

      threatened an incursion into the northern counties. The English regency,

      after trying in vain every expedient to restore peace with Scotland, made

      vigorous preparations for war; and besides assembling an English army of

      near sixty thousand men, they invited back John of Hainault, and some

      foreign cavalry whom they had dismissed, and whose discipline and arms had

      appeared superior to those of their own country. Young Edward himself,

      burning with a passion for military fame, appeared at the head of these

      numerous forces; and marched from Durham, the appointed place of

      rendezvous, in quest of the enemy, who had already broken into the

      frontiers, and were laying every thing waste around them.

     

      Murray and Douglas were the two most celebrated warriors, bred in the long

      hostilities between the Scots and English; and their forces, trained in

      the same school, and inured to hardships, fatigues, and dangers, were

      perfectly qualified, by their habits and manner of life, for that

      desultory and destructive war which they carried into England. Except a

      body of about four thousand cavalry, well armed, and fit to make a steady

      impression in battle, the rest of the army were light-armed troops,

      mounted on small horses, which found subsistence every where, and carried

      them with rapid and unexpected marches, whether they meant to commit

      depredations on the peaceable inhabitants, or to attack an armed enemy, or

      to retreat into their own country. Their whole equipage consisted of a bag

      of oatmeal, which, as a supply in case of necessity, each soldier carried

      behind him; together with a light plate of iron, on which he instantly

      baked the meal into a cake in the open fields. But his chief subsistence

      was the cattle which he seized; and his cookery was as expeditious as all

      his other operations. After flaying the animal, he placed the skin, loose

      and hanging in the form of a bag, upon some stakes; he poured water into

      it, kindled a fire below, and thus made it serve as a caldron for the

      boiling of his victuals.[*]

     

      The chief difficulty which Edward met with, after composing some dangerous

      frays which broke out between his foreign forces and the English,[*] was

      to come up with an army so rapid in its marches, and so little encumbered

      in its motions. Though the flame and smoke of burning villages directed

      him sufficiently to the place of their encampment, he found, upon hurrying

      thither, that they had already dislodged; and he soon discovered, by new

      marks of devastation, that they had removed to some distant quarter. After

      harassing his army during some time in this fruitless chase, he advanced

      northwards, and crossed the Tyne, with a resolution of awaiting them on

      their return homewards, and taking vengeance for all their

      depredations.[**] But that whole country was already so much wasted by

      their frequent incursions, that it could not afford subsistence to his

      army; and he was obliged again to return southwards, and change his plan

      of operations. He had now lost all track of the enemy; and though he

      promised the reward of a hundred pounds a year to any one who should bring

      him an account of their motions, he remained inactive some days before he

      received any intelligence of them.[***] He found at last that they had

      fixed their camp on the southern banks of the Were, as if they intended to

      await a battle; but their prudent leaders had chosen the ground with such

      judgment, that the English, on their approach, saw it impracticable,

      without temerity, to cross the river in their front, and attack them in

      their present situation. Edward, impatient for revenge and glory, here

      sent them a defiance, and challenged them, if they dared, to meet him in

      an equal field, and try the fortune of arms. The bold spirit of Douglas

      could ill brook this bravado, and he advised the acceptance of the

      challenge; but he was overruled by Murray, who replied to Edward that he

      never took the counsel of an enemy in any of his operations. The king,

      therefore, kept still his position opposite to the Scots; and daily

      expected that necessity would oblige them to change their quarters, and

      give him an opportunity of overwhelming them with superior forces. After a

      few days, they suddenly decamped, and marched farther up the river; but

      still posted themselves in such a manner as to preserve the advantage of

      the ground if the enemy should venture to attack them.[****]

     

      Edward insisted that all hazards should be run, rather than allow these

      ravagers to escape with impunity; but Mortimer’s authority prevented the

      attack, and opposed itself to the valor of the young monarch. While the

      armies lay in this position, an incident happened which had well nigh

      proved fatal to the English. Douglas, having gotten the word, and surveyed

      exactly the situation of the English camp, entered it secretly in the

      night-time, with a body of two hundred determined soldiers, and advanced

      to the royal tent, with a view of killing or carrying off the king in the

      midst of his army. But some of Edward’s attendants, awaking in that

      critical moment, made resistance; his chaplain and chamberlain sacrificed

      their lives for his safety; the king himself, after making a valorous

      defence, escaped in the dark; and Douglas, having lost the greater part of

      his followers, was glad to make a hasty retreat with the remainder.[*]

      Soon after, the Scottish army decamped without noise in the dead of night;

      and having thus gotten the start of the English, arrived without further

      loss in their own country. Edward, on entering the place of the Scottish

      encampment, found only six Englishmen, whom the enemy, after breaking

      their legs, had tied to trees, in order to prevent their carrying any

      intelligence to their countrymen.[**]

     

      The king was highly incensed at the disappointment which he had met with

      in his first enterprise, and at the head of so gallant an army. The

      symptoms which he had discovered of bravery and spirit gave extreme

      satisfaction, and were regarded as sure prognostics of an illustrious

      reign: but the general displeasure fell violently on Mortimer, who was

      already the object of public odium; and every measure which he pursued

      tended to aggravate, beyond all bounds, the hatred of the nation both

      against him and Queen Isabella.

     

      When the council of regency was formed, Mortimer, though in the plenitude

      of his power, had taken no care to insure a place in it; but this

      semblance of moderation was only a cover to the most iniquitous and most

      ambitious projects. He rendered that council entirely useless, by usurping

      to himself the whole sovereign authority; he settled on the queen dowager

      the greater part of the royal revenues; he never consulted either the

      princes of the blood or the nobility in any public measure; the king

      himself was so besieged by his creatures, that no access could be procured

      to him; and all the envy which had attended Gavaston and Spenser fell much

      more deservedly on the new favorite.

     

      1328.

     

      Mortimer, sensible of the growing hatred of the people, thought it

      requisite on any terms to secure peace abroad; and he entered into a

      negotiation with Robert Bruce for that purpose. As the claim of

      superiority in England, more than any other cause, had tended to inflame

      the animosities between the two nations, Mortimer, besides stipulating a

      marriage between Jane, sister of Edward, and David, the son and heir of

      Robert, consented to resign absolutely this claim, to give up all the

      homages done by the Scottish parliament and nobility, and to acknowledge

      Robert as independent sovereign of Scotland.[*] In return for these

      advantages, Robert stipulated the payment of thirty thousand marks to

      England. This treaty was ratified by parliament;[**] but was nevertheless

      the source of great discontent among the people, who, having entered

      zealously into the pretensions of Edward I., and deeming themselves

      disgraced by the successful resistance made by so inferior a nation, were

      disappointed, by this treaty, in all future hopes both of conquest and of

      vengeance.

     

      The princes of the blood, Kent, Norfolk, and Lancaster, were much united

      in their councils; and Mortimer entertained great suspicions of their

      designs against him. In summoning them to parliament, he strictly

      prohibited them, in the king’s name, from coming attended by an armed

      force; an illegal but usual practice in that age. The three earls, as they

      approached to Salisbury, the place appointed for the meeting of

      parliament, found, that though they themselves, in obedience to the king’s

      command, had brought only their usual retinue with them, Mortimer and his

      party were attended by all their followers in arms; and they began with

      some reason to apprehend a dangerous design against their persons. They

      retreated, assembled their retainers, and were returning with an army to

      take vengeance on Mortimer; when the weakness of Kent and Norfolk, who

      deserted the common cause, obliged Lancaster also to make his

      submissions.[***]

     

      The quarrel by the interposition of the prelates, seemed for the present

      to be appeased.

     

      1329.

     

      But Mortimer, in order to intimidate the princes, determined to have a

      victim; and the simplicity, with the good intentions of the earl of Kent,

      afforded him soon after an opportunity of practising upon him. By himself

      and his emissaries he endeavored to persuade that prince that his brother,

      King Edward, was still alive, and detained in some secret prison in

      England. The earl, whose remorses for the part which he had acted against

      the late king probably inclined him to give credit to this intelligence,

      entered into a design of restoring him to liberty, of reinstating him on

      the throne, and of making thereby some atonement for the injuries which he

      himself had unwarily done him.[*]

     

      1330.

     

      After this harmless contrivance had been allowed to proceed a certain

      length, the earl was seized by Mortimer, was accused before the

      parliament, and condemned, by those slavish though turbulent barons, to

      lose his life and fortune. The queen and Mortimer, apprehensive of young

      Edward’s lenity towards his uncle, hurried on the execution, and the

      prisoner was beheaded next day: but so general was the affection borne

      him, and such pity prevailed for his unhappy fate, that, though peers had

      been easily found to condemn him, it was evening before his enemies could

      find an executioner to perform the office.[**]

     

      The earl of Lancaster, on pretence of his having assented to this

      conspiracy, was soon after thrown into prison: many of the prelates and

      nobility were prosecuted: Mortimer employed this engine to crush all his

      enemies, and to enrich himself and his family by the forfeitures. The

      estate of the earl of Kent was seized for his younger son, Geoffrey: the

      immense fortunes of the Spensers and their adherents were mostly converted

      to his own use: he affected a state and dignity equal or superior to the

      royal: his power became formidable to every one: his illegal practices

      were daily complained of: and all parties, forgetting past animosities,

      conspired in their hatred of Mortimer.

     

      It was impossible that these abuses could long escape the observation of a

      prince endowed with so much spirit and judgment as young Edward, who,

      being now in his eighteenth year, and feeling himself capable of

      governing, repined at being held in fetters by this insolent minister. But

      so much was he surrounded by the emissaries of Mortimer, that it behoved

      him to conduct the project for subverting him with the same secrecy and

      precaution as if he had been forming a conspiracy against his sovereign.

      He communicated his intentions to Lord Mountacute, who engaged the Lords

      Molins and Clifford, Sir John Nevil of Hornby, Sir Edward Bohun, Ufford,

      and others, to enter into their views; and the Castle of Nottingham was

      chosen for the scene of the enterprise. The queen dowager and Mortimer

      lodged in that fortress: the king also was admitted, though with a few

      only of his attendants: and as the castle was strictly guarded, the gates

      locked every evening, and the keys carried to the queen, it became

      necessary to communicate the design to Sir William Eland, the governor,

      who zealously took part in it. By his direction, the king’s associates

      were admitted through a subterraneous passage, which had formerly been

      contrived for a secret outlet from the castle, but was now buried in

      rubbish; and Mortimer, without having it in his power to make resistance,

      was suddenly seized in an apartment adjoining to the queen’s.[*] A

      parliament was immediately summoned for his condemnation. He was accused

      before that assembly of having usurped regal power from the council of

      regency appointed by parliament; of having procured the death of the late

      king; of having deceived the earl of Kent into a conspiracy to restore

      that prince; of having solicited and obtained exorbitant grants of the

      royal demesnes; of having dissipated the public treasure; of secreting

      twenty thousand marks of the money paid by the king of Scotland; and of

      other crimes and misdemeanors.[**] The parliament condemned him from the

      supposed notoriety of the facts, without trial, or hearing his answer, or

      examining a witness; and he was hanged on a gibbet at the Elmes, in the

      neighborhood of London. It is remarkable, that this sentence was near

      twenty years after reversed by parliament, in favor of Mortimer’s son; and

      the reason assigned was, the illegal manner of proceeding.[***] The

      principles of law and justice were established in England, not in such a

      degree as to prevent any iniquitous sentence against a person obnoxious to

      the ruling party; but sufficient, on the return of his credit, or that of

      his friends, to serve as a reason or pretence for its reversal.

     

      1331.

     

      Justice was also executed by a sentence of the house of peers on some of

      the inferior criminals, particularly on Simon de Bereford: but the barons,

      in that act of jurisdiction, entered a protest, that though they had tried

      Bereford, who was none of their peers, they should not for the future be

      obliged to receive any such indictment. The queen was confined to her own

      house at Risings, near London: her revenue was reduced to four thousand

      pounds a year:[*] and though the king, during the remainder of her life,

      paid her a decent visit once or twice a year, she never was able to

      reinstate herself in any credit or authority.

     

      Edward, having now taken the reins of government into his own hands,

      applied himself, with industry and judgment, to redress all those

      grievances which had proceeded either from want of authority in the crown,

      or from the late abuses of it. He issued writs to the judges, enjoining

      them to administer justice, without paying any regard to arbitrary orders

      from the ministers: and as the robbers, thieves, murderers, and criminals

      of all kinds, had, during the course of public convulsions, multiplied to

      an enormous degree, and were openly protected by the great barons, who

      made use of them against their enemies, the king, after exacting from the

      peers a solemn promise in parliament, that they would break off all

      connections with such malefactors,[**] set himself in earnest to remedy

      the evil. Many of these gangs had become so numerous as to require his own

      presence to disperse them; and he exerted both courage and industry in

      executing this salutary office. The ministers of justice, from his

      example, employed the utmost diligence in discovering, pursuing, and

      punishing the criminals; and this disorder was by degrees corrected, at

      least palliated; the utmost that could be expected with regard to a

      disease hitherto inherent in the constitution.

     

      In proportion as the government acquired authority at home, it became

      formidable to the neighboring nations; and the ambitious spirit of Edward

      sought, and soon found, an opportunity of exerting itself. The wise and

      valiant Robert Bruce, who had recovered by arms the independence of his

      country, and had fixed it by the last treaty of peace with England, soon

      after died, and left David his son, a minor, under the guardianship of

      Randolph, earl of Murray, the companion of all his victories. It had been

      stipulated in this treaty, that both the Scottish nobility who, before the

      commencement of the wars enjoyed lands in England, and the English who

      inherited estates in Scotland, should be restored to their respective

      possessions:[*] but though this article had been executed pretty regularly

      on the part of Edward, Robert, who observed that the estates claimed by

      Englishmen were much more numerous and valuable than the others, either

      thought it dangerous to admit so many secret enemies into the kingdom, or

      found it difficult to wrest from his own followers the possessions

      bestowed on them as the reward of former services; and he had protracted

      the performance of his part of the stipulation. The English nobles,

      disappointed in their expectations, began to think of a remedy; and as

      their influence was great in the north, their enmity alone, even though

      unsupported by the King of England, became dangerous to the minor prince

      who succeeded to the Scottish throne.

     

      1332.

     

      Edward Baliol, the son of that John who was crowned king of Scotland, had

      been detained some time a prisoner in England after his father was

      released; but having also obtained his liberty, he went over to France,

      and resided in Normandy, on his patrimonial estate in that country,

      without any thoughts of reviving the claims of his family to the crown of

      Scotland. His pretensions, however plausible, had been so strenuously

      abjured by the Scots and rejected by the English, that he was universally

      regarded as a private person; and he had been thrown into prison on

      account of some private offence of which he was accused. Lord Beaumont, a

      great English baron, who, in the right of his wife, claimed the earldom of

      Buchan in Scotland,[**] found him in this situation; and deeming him a

      proper instrument for his purpose, made such interest with the king of

      France, who was not aware of the consequences, that he recovered him his

      liberty, and brought him over with him to England.

     

      The injured nobles, possessed of such a head, began to think of

      vindicating their rights by force of arms; and they applied to Edward for

      his concurrence and assistance. But there were several reasons which

      deterred the king from openly avowing their enterprise. In his treaty with

      Scotland he had entered into a bond of twenty thousand pounds, payable to

      the pope, if within four years he violated the peace; and as the term was

      not yet elapsed, he dreaded the exacting of that penalty by the sovereign

      pontiff, who possessed so many means of forcing princes to make payment.

      He was also afraid that violence and injustice would every where be

      imputed to him, if he attacked with superior force a minor king, and a

      brother-in-law, whose independent title had so lately been acknowledged by

      a solemn treaty. And as the regent of Scotland, on every demand which had

      been made of restitution to the English barons, had always confessed the

      justice of their claim, and had only given an evasive answer, grounded on

      plausible pretences, Edward resolved not to proceed by open violence, but

      to employ like artifices against him. He secretly encouraged Baliol in his

      enterprise; connived at his assembling forces in the north; and gave

      countenance to the nobles who were disposed to join in the attempt. A

      force of near two thousand five hundred men was enlisted under Baliol, by

      Umfreville, earl of Angus, the lords Beaumont, Ferrars, Fitz-warin, Wake,

      Stafford, Talbot, and Moubray. As these adventurers apprehended that the

      frontiers would be strongly armed and guarded, they resolved to make their

      attack by sea; and having embarked at Ravenspur, they reached in a few

      days the coast of Fife.

     

      Scotland was at that time in a very different situation from that in which

      it had appeared under the victorious Robert. Besides the loss of that

      great monarch, whose genius and authority preserved entire the whole

      political fabric, and maintained a union among the unruly barons, Lord

      Douglas, impatient of rest, had gone over to Spain in a crusade against

      the Moors, and had there perished in battle:[*] the earl of Murray, who

      had long been declining through age and infirmities, had lately died, and

      had been succeeded in the regency by Donald, earl of Marre, a man of much

      inferior talents: the military spirit of the Scots, though still unbroken,

      was left without a proper guidance and direction: and a minor king seemed

      ill qualified to defend an inheritance, which it had required all the

      consummate valor and abilities of his father to acquire and maintain.

     

      But as the Scots were apprised of the intended invasion, great numbers, on

      the appearance of the English fleet, immediately ran to the shore, in

      order to prevent the landing of the enemy. Baliol had valor and activity,

      and he drove back the Scots with considerable loss.[*] He marched westward

      into the heart of the country; flattering himself that the ancient

      partisans of his family would declare for him. But the fierce animosities

      which had been kindled between the two nations, inspiring the Scots with a

      strong prejudice against a prince supported by the English, he was

      regarded as a common enemy; and the regent found no difficulty in

      assembling a great army to oppose him. It is pretended that Marre had no

      less than forty thousand men under his banners; but the same hurry and

      impatience that made him collect a force, which, from its greatness, was

      so disproportioned to the occasion, rendered all his motions unskilful and

      imprudent. The River Erne ran between the two armies; and the Scots,

      confiding in that security, as well as in their great superiority of

      numbers, kept no order in their encampment. Baliol passed the river in the

      night-time; attacked the unguarded and undisciplined Scots; threw them

      into confusion, which was increased by the darkness, and by their very

      numbers, to which they trusted; and he beat them off the field with great

      slaughter.[**] But in the morning, when the Scots were at some distance,

      they were ashamed of having yielded the victory to so weak a foe, and they

      hurried back to recover the honor of the day. Their eager passions urged

      them precipitately to battle, without regard to some broken ground which

      lay between them and the enemy, and which disordered and confounded their

      ranks. Baliol seized the favorable opportunity, advanced his troops upon

      them, prevented them from rallying, and anew chased them off the field

      with redoubled slaughter. There fell above twelve thousand Scots in this

      action; and among these the flower of their nobility; the regent himself,

      the earl of Carrick, a natural son of their late king, the earls of Athole

      and Monteith, lord Hay of Errol, constable, and the lords Keith and

      Lindsey. The loss of the English scarcely exceeded thirty men; a strong

      proof, among many others, of the miserable state of military discipline in

      those ages.[***]

     

      Baliol soon after made himself master of Perth; but still was not able to

      bring over any of the Scots to his party. Patric Dunbar, earl of Marche,

      and Sir Archibald Douglas, brother to the lord of that name, appeared at

      the head of the Scottish armies, which amounted still to near forty

      thousand men; and they purposed to reduce Baliol and the English by

      famine. They blockaded Perth by land; they collected some vessels with

      which they invested it by water; but Baliol’s ships, attacking the

      Scottish fleet, gained a complete victory, and opened the communication

      between Perth and the sea.[*] The Scotch armies were then obliged to

      disband for want of pay and subsistence: the nation was in effect subdued

      by a handful of men: each nobleman who found himself most exposed to

      danger, successively submitted to Baliol: that prince was crowned at

      Scone: David, his competitor, was sent over to France with his betrothed

      wife Jane, sister to Edward: and the heads of his party sued to Baliol for

      a truce, which he granted them, in order to assemble a parliament in

      tranquillity, and have his title recognized by the whole Scottish nation.

     

      1333.

     

      But Baliol’s imprudence, or his necessities, making him dismiss the

      greater part of his English followers, he was, notwithstanding the truce,

      attacked of a sudden near Annan, by Sir Archibald Douglas and other

      chieftains of that party; he was routed; his brother, John Baliol, was

      slain; he himself was chased into England in a miserable condition; and

      thus lost his kingdom by a revolution as sudden as that by which he had

      acquired it.

     

      While Baliol enjoyed his short-lived and precarious royalty, he had been

      sensible that, without the protection of England, it would be impossible

      for him to maintain possession of the throne; and he had secretly sent a

      message to Edward, offering to acknowledge his superiority, to renew the

      homage for his crown, and to espouse the princess Jane, if the pope’s

      consent could be obtained for dissolving her former marriage, which was

      not yet consummated. Edward, ambitious of recovering that important

      concession, made by Mortimer during his minority, threw off all scruples,

      and willingly accepted the offer; but as the dethroning of Baliol had

      rendered this stipulation of no effect, the king prepared to reinstate him

      in possession of the crown; an enterprise which appeared from late

      experience so easy and so little hazardous. As he possessed many popular

      arts, he consulted his parliament on the occasion; but that assembly,

      finding the resolution already taken, declined giving any opinion, and

      only granted him, in order to support the enterprise, an aid of a

      fifteenth from the personal estates of the nobility and gentry, and a

      tenth of the movables of boroughs. And they added a petition, that the

      king would thenceforth live on his own revenue, without grieving his

      subjects by illegal taxes, or by the outrageous seizure of their goods in

      the shape of purveyance.[*]

     

      As the Scots expected that the chief brunt of the war would fall upon

      Berwick, Douglas, the regent, threw a strong garrison into that place,

      under the command of Sir William Keith, and he himself assembled a great

      army on the frontiers, ready to penetrate into England as soon as Edward

      should have invested that place. The English army was less numerous, but

      better supplied with arms and provisions, and retained in stricter

      discipline; and the king, notwithstanding the valiant defence made by

      Keith, had in two months reduced the garrison to extremities, and had

      obliged them to capitulate: they engaged to surrender, if they were not

      relieved within a few days by their countrymen.[**] This intelligence

      being conveyed to the Scottish army, which was preparing to invade

      Northumberland, changed their plan of operations, and engaged them to

      advance towards Berwick, and attempt the relief of that important

      fortress. Douglas, who had ever purposed to decline a pitched battle, in

      which he was sensible of the enemy’s superiority, and who intended to have

      drawn out the war by small skirmishes, and by mutually ravaging each

      other’s country, was forced, by the impatience of his troops, to put the

      fate of the kingdom upon the event of one day. He attacked the English at

      Halidown Hill, a little north of Berwick; and though his heavy-armed

      cavalry dismounted, in order to render the action more steady and

      desperate, they were received with such valor by Edward, and were so

      galled by the English archers, that they were soon thrown into disorder

      and on the fall of Douglas, their general, were totally routed. The whole

      army fled in confusion, and the English, but much more the Irish, gave

      little quarter in the pursuit: all the nobles of chief distinction were

      either slain or taken prisoners: near thirty thousand of the Scots fell in

      the action; while the loss of the English amounted only to one knight, one

      esquire, and thirteen private soldiers; an inequality almost

      incredible.[***]

     

      After this fatal blow, the Scottish nobles had no other resource than

      instant submission; and Edward, leaving a considerable body with Baliol to

      complete the conquest of the kingdom, returned with the remainder of his

      army to England. Baliol was acknowledged king by a parliament assembled at

      Edinburgh;[*] the superiority of England was again recognized; many of the

      Scottish nobility swore fealty to Edward; and to complete the misfortunes

      of that nation, Baliol ceded Berwick, Dunbar, Roxburgh, Edinburgh, and all

      the south-east counties of Scotland, which were declared to be forever

      annexed to the English monarchy.[**]

     

      1334.

     

      If Baliol on his first appearance was dreaded by the Scots, as an

      instrument employed by England for the subjection of the kingdom, this

      deed confirmed all their suspicions, and rendered him the object of

      universal hatred. Whatever submissions they might be obliged to make, they

      considered him not as their prince, but as the delegate and confederate of

      their determined enemy: and neither the manners of the age, nor the state

      of Edward’s revenue, permitting him to maintain a standing army in

      Scotland, the English forces were no sooner withdrawn, than the Scots

      revolted from Baliol, and returned to their former allegiance under Bruce.

      Sir Andrew Murray, appointed regent by the party of this latter prince,

      employed with success his valor and activity in many small but decisive

      actions against Baliol; and in a short time had almost wholly expelled him

      the kingdom.

     

      1335.

     

      Edward was obliged again to assemble an army, and to march into Scotland:

      the Scots, taught by experience, withdrew into their hills and fastnesses:

      he destroyed the houses and ravaged the estates of those whom he called

      rebels: but this confirmed them still further in their obstinate antipathy

      to England and to Baliol; and being now rendered desperate, they were

      ready to take advantage, on the first opportunity, of the retreat of their

      enemy, and they soon reconquered their country from the English.

     

      1336.

     

      Edward made anew his appearance in Scotland with like success: he found

      every thing hostile in the kingdom, except the spot on which he was

      encamped: and though he marched uncontrolled over the low countries, the

      nation itself was farther than ever from being broken and subdued. Besides

      being supported by their pride and anger, passions difficult to tame, they

      were encouraged, amidst all their calamities, by daily promises of relief

      from France; and as war was now likely to break out between that kingdom

      and England, they had reason to expect, from this incident, a great

      diversion of that force which had so long oppressed and overwhelmed them.

     

      1337.

     

      We now come to a transaction on which depended the most memorable events,

      not only of this long and active reign, but of the whole English and

      French history during more than a century; and it will therefore be

      necessary to give a particular account of the springs and causes of it.

     

      It had long been a prevailing opinion, that the crown of France could

      never descend to a female; and in order to give more authority to this

      maxim, and assign it a determinate origin, it had been usual to derive it

      from a clause in the Salian code, the law of an ancient tribe among the

      Franks; though that clause, when strictly examined, carries only the

      appearance of favoring this principle, and does not really, by the

      confession of the best antiquaries, bear the sense commonly imposed upon

      it. But though positive law seems wanting among the French for the

      exclusion of females, the practice had taken place; and the rule was

      established beyond controversy on some ancient as well as some modern

      precedents. During the first race of the monarchy, the Franks were so rude

      and barbarous a people, that they were incapable of submitting to a female

      reign; and in that period of their history there were frequent instances

      of kings advanced to royalty, in prejudice of females who were related to

      the crown by nearer degrees of consanguinity. These precedents, joined to

      like causes, had also established the male succession in the second race;

      and though the instances were neither so frequent nor so certain during

      that period, the principle of excluding the female line seems still to

      have prevailed, and to have directed the conduct of the nation. During the

      third race, the crown had descended from father to son for eleven

      generations, from Hugh Capet to Lewis Hutin; and thus, in fact, during the

      course of nine hundred years, the French monarchy had always been governed

      by males, and no female, and none who founded his title on a female, had

      ever mounted the throne. Philip the Fair, father of Lewis Hutin, left

      three sons, this Lewis, Philip the Long, and Charles the Fair, and one

      daughter, Isabella, queen of England. Lewis Hutin, the eldest, left at his

      death one daughter, by Margaret, sister to Eudes, duke of Burgundy; and as

      his queen was then pregnant, Philip, his younger brother, was appointed

      regent, till it should appear whether the child proved a son or a

      daughter. The queen bore a male, who lived only a few days: Philip was

      proclaimed king: and as the duke of Burgundy made some opposition, and

      asserted the rights of his niece, the states of the kingdom, by a solemn

      and deliberate decree, gave her an exclusion, and declared all females

      forever incapable of succeeding to the crown of France. Philip died after

      a short reign, leaving three daughters; and his brother Charles, without

      dispute or controversy, then succeeded to the crown. The reign of Charles

      was also short; he left one daughter; but as his queen was pregnant, the

      next male heir was appointed regent, with a declared right of succession

      if the issue should prove female. This prince was Philip de Valois,

      cousin-german to the deceased king; being the son of Charles de Valois,

      brother of Philip the Fair. The queen of France was delivered of a

      daughter: the regency ended; and Philip de Valois was unanimously placed

      on the throne of France.

     

      The king of England, who was at that time a youth of fifteen years of age,

      embraced a notion that he was entitled, in right of his mother, to the

      succession of the kingdom, and that the claim of the nephew was preferable

      to that of the cousin-german. There could not well be imagined a notion

      weaker or worse grounded. The principle of excluding females was of old an

      established opinion in France, and had acquired equal authority with the

      most express and positive law: it was supported by ancient precedents: it

      was confirmed by recent instances, solemnly and deliberately decided: and

      what placed it still farther beyond controversy, if Edward was disposed to

      question its validity, he thereby cut off his own pretensions; since the

      three last kings had all left daughters, who were still alive, and who

      stood before him in the order of succession. He was therefore reduced to

      assert that, though his mother Isabella was, on account of her sex,

      incapable of succeeding, he himself, who inherited through her, was liable

      to no such objection, and might claim by the right of propinquity. But,

      besides that this pretension was more favorable to Charles, king of

      Navarre, descended from the daughter of Lewis Hutin, it was so contrary to

      the established principles of succession in every country of Europe,[*]

      was so repugnant to the practice both in private and public inheritances,

      that nobody in France thought of Edward’s claim.

     

      Philip’s title was universally recognized;[*] and he never imagined that

      he had a competitor, much less so formidable a one as the king of England.

     

      But though the youthful and ambitious mind of Edward had rashly

      entertained this notion, he did not think proper to insist on his

      pretensions, which must have immediately involved him, on very unequal

      terms, in a dangerous and implacable war with so powerful a monarch.

      Philip was a prince of mature years, of great experience, and at that time

      of an established character both for prudence and valor; and by these

      circumstances, as well as by the internal union of his people, and their

      acquiescence in his undoubted right, he possessed every advantage above a

      raw youth, newly raised, by injustice and violence, to the government of

      the most intractable and most turbulent subjects in Europe. But there

      immediately occurred an incident which required that Edward should either

      openly declare his pretensions, or forever renounce and abjure them. He

      was summoned to do homage for Guienne: Philip was preparing to compel him

      by force of arms: that country was in a very bad state of defence: and the

      forfeiture of so rich an inheritance was, by the feudal law, the immediate

      consequence of his refusing or declining to perform the duty of a vassal.

      Edward therefore thought it prudent to submit to present necessity: he

      went over to Amiens, did homage to Philip, and as there had arisen some

      controversy concerning the terms of this submission, he afterwards sent

      over a formal deed, in which he acknowledged that he owed liege homage to

      France;[**] which was in effect ratifying, and that in the strongest

      terms, Philip’s title to the crown of that kingdom. His own claim indeed

      was so unreasonable, and so thoroughly disavowed by the whole French

      nation, that to insist on it was no better than pretending to the violent

      conquest of the kingdom; and it is probable that he would never have

      further thought of it, had it not been for some incidents which excited an

      animosity between the monarchs.

     

      Robert of Artois was descended from the blood royal of France, was a man

      of great character and authority, had espoused Philip’s sister, and by his

      birth, talents, and credit was entitled to make the highest figure, and

      fill the most important offices in the monarchy. This prince had lost the

      county of Artois, which he claimed as his birthright, by a sentence,

      commonly deemed iniquitous, of Philip the Fair; and he was seduced to

      attempt recovering possession by an action so unworthy of his rank and

      character as a forgery.[*] The detection of this crime covered him with

      shame and confusion: his brother-in-law not only abandoned him, but

      prosecuted him with violence: Robert, incapable of bearing disgrace, left

      the kingdom, and hid himself in the Low Countries: chased from that

      retreat by the authority of Philip, he came over to England; in spite of

      the French king’s menaces and remonstrances, he was favorably received by

      Edward; [**] and was soon admitted into the councils and shared the

      confidence of that monarch. Abandoning himself to all the movements of

      rage and despair, he endeavored to revive the prepossession entertained by

      Edward in favor of his title to the crown of France, and even flattered

      him that it was not impossible for a prince of his valor and abilities to

      render his claim effectual.

     

      The king was the more disposed to hearken to suggestions of this nature,

      because he had, in several particulars, found reason to complain of

      Philip’s conduct with regard to Guienne, and because that prince had both

      given protection to the exiled David Bruce, and supported, at least

      encouraged, the Scots in their struggles for independence. Thus resentment

      gradually filled the breasts of both monarchs, and made them incapable of

      hearkening to any terms of accommodation proposed by the pope, who never

      ceased interposing his good offices between them. Philip thought that he

      should be wanting to the first principles of policy if he abandoned

      Scotland: Edward affirmed that he must relinquish all pretensions to

      generosity if he withdrew his protection from Robert. The former, informed

      of some preparations for hostilities which had been made by his rival,

      issued a sentence of felony and attainder against Robert, and declared

      that every vassal of the crown, whether within or without the kingdom, who

      gave countenance to that traitor, would be involved in the same sentence;

      a menace easy to be understood: the latter, resolute not to yield,

      endeavored to form alliances in the Low Countries and on the frontiers of

      Germany, the only places from which he either could make an effectual

      attack upon France, or produce such a diversion as might save the province

      of Guienne, which lay so much exposed to the power of Philip.

     

      The king began with opening his intentions to the count of Hainault, his

      father-in-law; and having engaged him in his interests, he employed the

      good offices and councils of that prince in drawing into his alliance the

      other sovereigns of that neighborhood. The duke of Brabant was induced, by

      his mediation, and by large remittances of money from England, to promise

      his concurrence;[*] the archbishop of Cologne, the duke of Gueldres, the

      marquis of Juliers, the count of Namur, the lords of Fauquemont and

      Baquen, were engaged by like motives to embrace the English alliance.[**]

      These sovereign princes could supply, either from their own states or from

      the bordering countries, great numbers of warlike troops; and nought was

      wanting to make the force on that quarter very formidable but the

      accession of Flanders; which Edward procured by means somewhat

      extraordinary and unusual.

     

      As the Flemings were the first people in the northern parts of Europe that

      cultivated arts and manufactures, the lower ranks of men among them had

      risen to a degree of opulence unknown elsewhere to those of their station

      in that barbarous age; had acquired privileges and independence, and began

      to emerge from that state of vassalage, or rather of slavery, into which

      the common people had been universally thrown by the feudal institutions.

      It was probably difficult for them to bring their sovereign and their

      nobility to conform themselves to the principles of law and civil

      government, so much neglected in every other country: it was impossible

      for them to confine themselves within the proper bounds in their

      opposition and resentment against any instance of tyranny: they had risen

      in tumults: had insulted the nobles: had chased their earl into France;

      and delivering themselves over to the guidance of a seditious leader, had

      been guilty of all that insolence and disorder to which the thoughtless

      and enraged populace are so much inclined, wherever they are unfortunate

      enough to be their own masters.[***]

     

      Their present leader was James d’Arteville, a brewer in Ghent, who

      governed them with a more absolute sway than had ever been assumed by any

      of their lawful sovereigns: he placed and displaced the magistrates at

      pleasure: he was accompanied by a guard, who, on the least signal from

      him, instantly assassinated any man that happened to fall under his

      displeasure: all the cities of Flanders were full of his spies: and it was

      immediate death to give him the smallest umbrage: the few nobles who

      remained in the country, lived in continual terror from his violence: he

      seized the estates of all those whom he had either banished or murdered;

      and bestowing part on their wives and children, converted the remainder to

      his own use.* Such were the first effects that Europe saw of popular

      violence, after having groaned, during so many ages, under monarchical and

      aristocratical tyranny.

     

      James d’Arteville was the man to whom Edward addressed himself for

      bringing over the Flemings to his interests; and that prince, the most

      haughty and most aspiring of the age, never courted any ally with so much

      assiduity and so many submissions as he employed towards this seditious

      and criminal tradesman. D’Arteville, proud of these advances from the king

      of England, and sensible that the Flemings were naturally inclined to

      maintain connections with the English who furnished them the materials of

      their woollen manufactures, the chief source of their opulence, readily

      embraced the interests of Edward, and invited him over into the Low

      Countries. Edward, before he entered on this great enterprise, affected to

      consult his parliament, asked their advice, and obtained their consent.[*]

      And the more to strengthen his hands, he procured from them a grant of

      twenty thousand sacks of wool; which might amount to about a hundred

      thousand pounds: this commodity was a good instrument to employ with the

      Flemings; and the price of it with his German allies. He completed the

      other necessary sums by loans, by pawning the crown jewels, by

      confiscating or rather robbing at once all the Lombards, who now exercised

      the invidious trade formerly monopolized by the Jews, of lending on

      interest;[**] and being attended by a body of English forces, and by

      several of his nobility, he sailed over to Flanders.

     

      1338.

     

      The German princes, in order to justify their unprovoked hostilities

      against France, had required the sanction of some legal authority; and

      Edward, that he might give them satisfaction on this head, had applied to

      Lewis of Bavaria, then emperor, and had been created by him “vicar of the

      empire;” an empty title, but which seemed to give him a right of

      commanding the service of the princes of Germany.[*] The Flemings, who

      were vassals of France, pretending like scruples with regard to the

      invasion of their liege lord; Edward, by the advice of d’Arteville,

      assumed, in his commissions, the title of king of France; and, in virtue

      of this right, claimed their assistance for dethroning Philip de Valois,

      the usurper of his kingdom.[**]

     

      This step, which he feared would destroy all future amity between the

      kingdoms, and beget endless and implacable jealousies in France, was not

      taken by him without much reluctance and hesitation: and not being in

      itself very justifiable, it has in the issue been attended with many

      miseries to both kingdoms. From this period we may date the commencement

      of that great animosity which the English nation have ever since borne to

      the French, which has so visible an influence on all future transactions,

      and which has been, and continues to be, the spring of many rash and

      precipitate resolutions among them. In all the preceding reigns since the

      conquest, the hostilities between the two crowns had been only casual and

      temporary; and as they had never been attended with any bloody or

      dangerous event, the traces of them were easily obliterated by the first

      treaty of pacification. The English nobility and gentry valued themselves

      on their French or Norman extraction: they affected to employ the language

      of that country in all public transactions, and even in familiar

      conversation; and both the English court and camp being always full of

      nobles who came from different provinces of France, the two people were,

      during some centuries, more intermingled together than any two distinct

      nations whom we meet with in history. But the fatal pretensions of Edward

      III. dissolved all these connections, and left the seeds of great

      animosity in both countries, especially among the English. For it is

      remarkable, that this latter nation, though they were commonly the

      aggressors, and by their success and situation were enabled to commit the

      most cruel injuries on the other, have always retained a stronger tincture

      of national antipathy; nor is their hatred retaliated on them to an equal

      degree by the French. That country lies in the middle of Europe, has been

      successively engaged in hostilities with all its neighbors, the popular

      prejudices have been diverted into many channels, and, among a people of

      softer manners, they never rose to a great height against any particular

      nation.

     

      Philip made great preparations against the attack from the English, and

      such as seemed more than sufficient to secure him from the danger. Besides

      the concurrence of all the nobility in his own populous and warlike

      kingdom, his foreign alliances were both more cordial and more powerful

      than those which were formed by his antagonist. The pope, who, at this

      time, lived in Avignon, was dependent on France; and being disgusted at

      the connections between Edward and Lewis of Bavaria, whom he had

      excommunicated, he embraced with zeal and sincerity the cause of the

      French monarch. The king of Navarre, the duke of Brittany, the count of

      Bar, were in the same interests; and on the side of Germany, the king of

      Bohemia, the Palatine, the dukes of Lorraine and Austria, the bishop of

      Liege, the counts of Deuxpont, Vaudemont, and Geneva. The allies of Edward

      were in themselves weaker; and having no object but his money, which began

      to be exhausted, they were slow in their motions and irresolute in their

      measures.

     

      1339.

     

      The duke of Brabant, the most powerful among them, seemed even inclined to

      withdraw himself wholly from the alliance; and the king was necessitated

      both to give the Brabanters new privileges in trade, and to contract his

      son Edward with the daughter of that prince, ere he could bring him to

      fulfil his engagements. The summer was wasted in conferences and

      negotiations before Edward could take the field; and he was obliged, in

      order to allure his German allies into his measures, to pretend that the

      first attack should be made upon Cambray, a city of the empire which had

      been garrisoned by Philip.[*] But finding, upon trial, the difficulty of

      the enterprise, he conducted them towards the frontiers of France; and he

      there saw, by a sensible proof, the vanity of his expectations: the count

      of Namur, and even the count of Hainault, his brother-in-law (for the old

      count was dead,) refused to commence hostilities against their liege lord,

      and retired with their troops.[**] So little account did they make of

      Edward’s pretensions to the crown of France!

     

      The king, however, entered the enemy’s country, and encamped on the fields

      of Vironfosse, near Capeile, with an army of near fifty thousand men,

      composed almost entirely of foreigners: Philip approached him with an army

      of near double the force, composed chiefly of native subjects; and it was

      daily expected that a battle would ensue. But the English monarch was

      averse to engage against so great a superiority: the French thought it

      sufficient if he eluded the attacks of his enemy, without running any

      unnecessary hazard. The two armies faced each other for some days: mutual

      defiances were sent: and Edward, at last, retired into Flanders, and

      disbanded his army.[*]

     

      Such was the fruitless and almost ridiculous conclusion of Edward’s mighty

      preparations; and as his measures were the most prudent that could be

      embraced in his situation, he might learn from experience in what a

      hopeless enterprise he was engaged. His expenses, though they had led to

      no end, had been consuming and destructive; he had contracted near three

      hundred thousand pounds of debt;[**] he had anticipated all his revenue;

      he had pawned every thing of value which belonged either to himself or his

      queen; he was obliged in some measure even to pawn himself to his

      creditors, by not sailing to England till he obtained their permission,

      and by promising on his word of honor to return in person, if he did not

      remit their money.

     

      But he was a prince of too much spirit to be discouraged by the first

      difficulties of an undertaking; and he was anxious to retrieve his honor

      by more successful and more gallant enterprises. For this purpose he had,

      during the course of the campaign, sent orders to summon a parliament by

      his son Edward, whom he had left with the title of guardian, and to demand

      some supply in his urgent necessities. The barons seemed inclined to grant

      his request; but the knights, who often, at this time, acted as a separate

      body from the burgesses, made some scruple of taxing their constituents

      without their consent; and they desired the guardian to summon a new

      parliament, which might be properly empowered for that purpose. The

      situation of the king and parliament was for the time, nearly similar to

      that which they constantly fell into about the beginning of the last

      century; and similar consequences began visibly to appear. The king,

      sensible of the frequent demands which he should be obliged to make on his

      people, had been anxious to insure to his friends a seat in the house of

      commons, and at his instigation the sheriffs and other placemen had made

      interest to be elected into that assembly; an abuse which the knights

      desired the king to correct by the tenor of his writ of summons, and which

      was accordingly remedied. On the other hand, the knights had professedly

      annexed conditions to their intended grant, and required a considerable

      retrenchment of the royal prerogatives, particularly with regard to

      purveyance, and the levying of the ancient feudal aids for knighting the

      king’s eldest son, and marrying his eldest daughter. The new parliament,

      called by the guardian, retained the same free spirit; and though they

      offered a large supply of thirty thousand sacks of wool, no business was

      concluded; because the conditions which they annexed appeared too high to

      be compensated by a temporary concession. But when Edward himself came

      over to England, he summoned another parliament, and he had the interest

      to procure a supply on more moderate terms. A confirmation of the two

      charters, and of the privileges of boroughs, a pardon for old debts and

      trespasses, and a remedy for some abuses in the execution of common law,

      were the chief conditions insisted on; and the king, in return for his

      concessions on these heads, obtained from the barons and knights an

      unusual grant for two years, of the ninth sheaf, lamb, and fleece on their

      estates, and from the burgesses a ninth of their movables at their true

      value. The whole parliament also granted a duty of forty shillings on each

      sack of wool exported, on each three hundred woolfells, and on each last

      of leather for the same term of years, but dreading the arbitrary spirit

      of the crown, they expressly declared, that this grant was to continue no

      longer, and was not to be drawn into precedent. Being soon after sensible

      that this supply, though considerable, and very unusual in that age, would

      come in slowly, and would not answer the king’s urgent necessities,

      proceeding both from his debts and his preparations for war, they agreed

      that twenty thousand sacks of wool should immediately be granted him, and

      their value be deducted from the ninths which were afterwards to be

      levied.

     

      But there appeared at this time another jealousy in the parliament, which

      was very reasonable, and was founded on a sentiment that ought to have

      engaged them rather to check than support the king in all those ambitious

      projects, so little likely to prove successful, and so dangerous to the

      nation if they did. Edward, who, before the commencement of the former

      campaign, had, in several commissions, assumed the title of king of

      France, now more openly, in all public deeds, gave himself that

      appellation, and always quartered the arms of France with those of England

      in his seals and ensigns. The parliament thought proper to obviate the

      consequences of this measure, and to declare that they owed him no

      obedience as king of France, and that the two kingdoms must forever remain

      distinct and independent.[*] They undoubtedly foresaw that France, if

      subdued, would in the end prove the seat of government; and they deemed

      this previous protestation necessary, in order to prevent their becoming a

      province to that monarchy: a frail security if the event had really taken

      place!

     

      1340.

     

      As Philip was apprised, from the preparations which were making both in

      England and the Low Countries, that he must expect another invasion from

      Edward, he fitted out a great fleet of four hundred vessels, manned with

      forty thousand men: and he stationed them off Sluise, with a view of

      intercepting the king in his passage. The English navy was much inferior

      in number, consisting only of two hundred and forty sail; but whether it

      were by the superior abilities of Edward, or the greater dexterity of his

      seamen, they gained the wind of the enemy, and had the sun in their backs:

      and with these advantages began the action. The battle was fierce and

      bloody: the English archers, whose force and address were now much

      celebrated, galled the French on their approach: and when the ships

      grappled together, and the contest became more steady and furious, the

      example of the king, and of so many gallant nobles who accompanied him,

      animated to such a degree the seamen and soldiery, that they maintained

      every where a superiority over the enemy. The French also had been guilty

      of some imprudence in taking their station so near the coast of Flanders,

      and choosing that place for the scene of action. The Flemings, descrying

      the battle, hurried out of their harbors, and brought a reÃ«nforcement to

      the English; which, coming unexpectedly, had a greater effect than in

      proportion to its power and numbers. Two hundred and thirty French ships

      were taken: thirty thousand Frenchmen were killed, with two of their

      admirals: the loss of the English was inconsiderable, compared to the

      greatness and importance of the victory.[*] None of Philip’s courtiers, it

      is said, dared to inform him of the event; till his fool or jester gave

      him a hint, by which he discovered the loss that he had sustained.[**]

     

      The lustre of this great success increased the king’s authority among his

      allies, who assembled their forces with expedition, and joined the English

      army. Edward marched to the frontiers of France at the head of above one

      hundred thousand men, consisting chiefly of foreigners, a more numerous

      army than either before or since has ever been commanded by any king of

      England.[***] At the same time the Flemings, to the number of fifty

      thousand men, marched out under the command of Robert of Artois, and laid

      siege to St. Omer; but this tumultuary army, composed entirely of

      tradesmen unexperienced in war, was routed by a sally of the garrison, and

      notwithstanding the abilities of their leader, was thrown into such a

      panic, that they were instantly dispersed, and never more appeared in the

      field. The enterprises of Edward, though not attended with so inglorious

      an issue, proved equally vain and fruitless. The king of France had

      assembled an army more numerous than the English; was accompanied by all

      the chief nobility of his kingdom; was attended by many foreign princes,

      and even by three monarchs, the kings of Bohemia, Scotland, and

      Navarre:[****] yet he still adhered to the prudent resolution of putting

      nothing to hazard; and after throwing strong garrisons into all the

      frontier towns, he retired backwards, persuaded that the enemy, having

      wasted their force in some tedious and unsuccessful enterprise, would

      afford him an easy victory.

     

      Tournay was at that time one of the most considerable cities of Flanders,

      containing above sixty thousand inhabitants of all ages, who were

      affectionate to the French government: and as the secret of Edward’s

      designs had not been strictly kept, Philip learned that the English, in

      order to gratify their Flemish allies, had intended to open the campaign

      with the siege of this place: he took care therefore to supply it with a

      garrison of fourteen thousand men, commanded by the bravest nobility of

      France; and he reasonably expected that these forces, joined to the

      inhabitants, would be able to defend the city against all the efforts of

      the enemy. Accordingly Edward, when he commenced the siege about the end

      of July found every where an obstinate resistance: the valor of one side

      was encountered with equal valor by the other: every assault was repulsed,

      and proved unsuccessful: and the king was at last obliged to turn the

      siege into a blockade, in hopes that the great numbers of the garrison and

      citizens, which had enabled them to defend themselves against his attacks,

      would but expose them to be the more easily reduced by famine.[*] The

      count of Eu, who commanded in Tournay, as soon as he perceived that the

      English had formed this plan of operations endeavored to save his

      provisions by expelling all the useless mouths; and the duke of Brabant,

      who wished no success to Edward’s enterprises, gave every one a free

      passage through his quarters.

     

      After the siege had continued ten weeks, the city was reduced to distress;

      and Philip, recalling all his scattered garrisons, advanced towards the

      English camp at the head of a mighty army, with an intention of still

      avoiding any decisive action, but of seeking some opportunity for throwing

      relief into the place. Here Edward, irritated with the small progress he

      had hitherto made, and with the disagreeable prospect that lay before him,

      sent Philip a defiance by a herald and challenged him to decide their

      claims for the crown of France either by single combat, or by an action of

      a hundred against a hundred, or by a general engagement. But Philip

      replied, that Edward having done homage to him for the duchy of Guienne,

      and having solemnly acknowledged him for his superior, it by no means

      became him to send a defiance to his liege lord and sovereign: that he was

      confident, notwithstanding all Edward’s preparations, and his conjunction

      with the rebellious Flemings, he himself should soon be able to chase him

      from the frontiers of France: that as the hostilities from England had

      prevented him from executing his purposed crusade against the infidels, he

      trusted in the assistance of the Almighty, who would reward his pious

      intentions, and punish the aggressor, whose ill-grounded claims had

      rendered them abortive: that Edward proposed a duel on very unequal terms,

      and offered to hazard only his own person against both the kingdom of

      France and the person of the king: but that, if he would increase the

      stake, and put also the kingdom of England on the issue of the duel, he

      would, notwithstanding that the terms would still be unequal, very

      willingly accept of the challenge.[*] It was easy to see that these mutual

      bravadoes were intended only to dazzle the populace, and that the two

      kings were too wise to think of executing their pretended purpose.

     

      While the French and English armies lay in this situation, and a general

      action was every day expected, Jane, countess dowager of Hainault,

      interposed with her good offices, and endeavored to conciliate peace

      between the contending monarchs, and to prevent any further effusion of

      blood. This princess was mother-in-law to Edward, and sister to Philip;

      and though she had taken the vows in a convent, and had renounced the

      world, she left her retreat on this occasion, and employed all her pious

      efforts to allay those animosities which had taken place between persons

      so nearly related to her and to each other. As Philip had no material

      claims on his antagonist, she found that he hearkened willingly to the

      proposals; and even the haughty and ambitious Edward, convinced of his

      fruitless attempt, was not averse to her negotiation. He was sensible,

      from experience, that he had engaged in an enterprise which far exceeded

      his force; and that the power of England was never likely to prevail over

      that of a superior kingdom, firmly united under an able and prudent

      monarch. He discovered that all the allies whom he could gain by

      negotiation were at bottom averse to his enterprise; and though they might

      second it to a certain length, would immediately detach themselves, and

      oppose its final accomplishment, if ever they could be brought to think

      that there was seriously any danger of it. He even saw that their chief

      purpose was to obtain money from him; and as his supplies from England

      came in very slowly, and had much disappointed his expectations, he

      perceived their growing indifference in his cause, and their desire of

      embracing all plausible terms of accommodation. Convinced at last that an

      undertaking must be imprudent which could only be supported by means so

      unequal to the end, he concluded a truce, which left both parties in

      possession of their present acquisitions, and stopped all further

      hostilities on the side of the Low Countries, Guienne, and Scotland, till

      midsummer next.[*] A negotiation was soon after opened at Arras, under the

      mediation of the pope’s legates; and the truce was attempted to be

      converted into a solid peace. Edward here required that Philip should free

      Guienne from all claims of superiority, and entirely withdraw his

      protection from Scotland: but as he seemed not anywise entitled to make

      such high demands, either from his past successes or future prospects,

      they were totally rejected by Philip, who agreed only to a prolongation of

      the truce.

     

      The king of France soon after detached the emperor Lewis from the alliance

      of England, and engaged him to revoke the title of imperial vicar, which

      he had conferred on Edward.[**] The king’s other allies on the frontiers

      of France, disappointed in their hopes, gradually withdrew from the

      confederacy. And Edward himself, harassed by his numerous and importunate

      creditors, was obliged to make his escape by stealth into England.

     

      The unusual tax of a ninth sheaf, lamb, and fleece, imposed by parliament,

      together with the great want of money, and still more, of credit in

      England, had rendered the remittances to Flanders extremely backward; nor

      could it be expected, that any expeditious method of collecting an

      imposition, which was so new in itself, and which yielded only a gradual

      produce, could possibly be contrived by the king or his ministers. And

      though the parliament, foreseeing the inconvenience, had granted, as a

      present resource, twenty thousand sacks of wool, the only English goods

      that bore a sure price in foreign markets, and were the next to ready

      money, it was impossible but the getting possession of such a bulky

      commodity, the gathering of it from different parts of the kingdom, and

      the disposing of it abroad, must take up more time than the urgency of the

      king’s affairs would permit, and must occasion all the disappointments

      complained of during the course of the campaign. But though nothing had

      happened which Edward might not reasonably have foreseen, he was so

      irritated with the unfortunate issue of his military operations, and so

      much vexed and affronted by his foreign creditors, that he was determined

      to throw the blame somewhere off himself and he came in very bad humor

      into England. He discovered his peevish disposition by the first act which

      he performed after his arrival: as he landed unexpectedly, he found the

      Tower negligently guarded; and he immediately committed to prison the

      constable and all others who had the charge of that fortress, and he

      treated them with unusual rigor.[*] His vengeance fell next on the

      officers of the revenue, the sheriffs, the collectors of the taxes, the

      undertakers of all kinds; and besides dismissing all of them from their

      employments, he appointed commissioners to inquire into their conduct; and

      these men, in order to gratify the king’s humor, were sure not to find any

      person innocent who came before them.[**] Sir John St. Paul, keeper of the

      privy seal, Sir John Stonore, chief justice, Andrew Aubrey, mayor of

      London, were displaced and imprisoned; as were also the bishop of

      Chichester, chancellor, and the bishop of Lichfield, treasurer; Stratford,

      archbishop of Canterbury, to whom the charge of collecting the new taxes

      had been chiefly intrusted, fell likewise under the king’s displeasure;

      but being absent at the time of Edward’s arrival, he escaped feeling the

      immediate effects of it.

     

      There were strong reasons, which might discourage the kings of England, in

      those ages, from bestowing the chief offices of the crown on prelates and

      other ecclesiastical persons. These men had so intrenched themselves in

      privileges and immunities, and so openly challenged an exemption from all

      secular jurisdiction, that no civil penalty could be inflicted on them for

      any malversation in office; and as even treason itself was declared to be

      no canonical offence, nor was allowed to be a sufficient reason for

      deprivation or other spiritual censures, that order of men had insured to

      themselves an almost total impunity, and were not bound by any political

      law or statute. But, on the other hand, there were many peculiar causes

      which favored their promotion. Besides that they possessed almost all the

      learning of the age, and were best qualified for civil employments, the

      prelates enjoyed equal dignity with the greatest barons, and gave weight

      by their personal authority, to the powers intrusted with them; while, at

      the same time, they did not endanger the crown by accumulating wealth or

      influence in their families, and were restrained, by the decency of their

      character, from that open rapine and violence so often practised by the

      nobles. These motives had induced Edward, as well as many of his

      predecessors, to intrust the chief departments of government in the hands

      of ecclesiastics; at the hazard of seeing them disown his authority as

      soon as it was turned against them.

     

      1341.

     

      This was the case with Archbishop Stratford. That prelate, informed of

      Edward’s indignation against him prepared himself for the storm; and not

      content with standing upon the defensive, he resolved, by beginning the

      attack, to show the king that he knew the privileges of his character, and

      had courage to maintain them. He issued a general sentence of

      excommunication against all who, on any pretext, exercised violence on the

      person or goods of clergymen; who infringed those privileges secured by

      the Great Charter, and by ecclesiastical canons; or who accused a prelate

      of treason or any other crime, in order to bring him under the king’s

      displeasure.[*]

     

      Even Edward had reason to think himself struck at by this sentence; both

      on account of the imprisonment of the two bishops and that of other

      clergymen concerned in levying the taxes, and on account of his seizing

      their lands and movables, that he might make them answerable for any

      balance which remained in their hands. The clergy, with the primate at

      their head, were now formed into a regular combination against the king;

      and many calumnies were spread against him, in order to deprive him of the

      confidence and affections of his people. It was pretended that he meant to

      recall the general pardon, and the remission which he had granted of old

      debts, and to impose new and arbitrary taxes without consent of

      parliament. The archbishop went so far, in a letter to the king himself,

      as to tell him, that there were two powers by which the world was

      governed, the holy pontifical apostolic dignity, and the royal subordinate

      authority: that of these two powers, the clerical was evidently the

      supreme; since the priests were to answer, at the tribunal of the divine

      judgment, for the conduct of kings themselves: that the clergy were the

      spiritual fathers of all the faithful, and amongst others of kings and

      princes; and were entitled, by a heavenly charter, to direct their wills

      and actions, and to censure their transgressions: and that prelates had

      hitherto cited emperors before their tribunal, had sitten in judgment on

      their life and behavior, and had anathematized them for their obstinate

      offences.[*] These topics were not well calculated to appease Edward’s

      indignation; and when he called a parliament, he sent not to the primate,

      as to the other peers, a summons to attend it. Stratford was not

      discouraged at this mark of neglect or anger: he appeared before the

      gates, arrayed in his pontifical robes, holding the crosier in his hand

      and accompanied by a pompous train of priests and prelates; and he

      required admittance as the first and highest peer in the realm. During two

      days the king rejected his application: but sensible, either that this

      affair might be attended with dangerous consequences, or that in his

      impatience he had groundlessly accused the primate of malversation in his

      office, which seems really to have been the case, he at last permitted him

      to take his seat, and was reconciled to him.[**]

     

      Edward now found himself in a bad situation, both with his own people and

      with foreign states; and it required all his genius and capacity to

      extricate himself from such multiplied difficulties and embarrassments.

      His unjust and exorbitant claims on France and Scotland had engaged him in

      an implacable war with those two kingdoms, his nearest neighbors: he had

      lost almost all his foreign alliances by his irregular payments: he was

      deeply involved in debts, for which he owed a consuming interest: his

      military operations had vanished into smoke; and, except his naval

      victory, none of them had been attended even with glory or renown, either

      to himself or to the nation: the animosity between him and the clergy was

      open and declared: the people were discontented on account of many

      arbitrary measures, in which he had been engaged, and what was more

      dangerous, the nobility, taking advantage of his present necessities, were

      determined to retrench his power, and by encroaching on the ancient

      prerogatives of the crown, to acquire to themselves independence and

      authority. But the aspiring genius of Edward, which had so far transported

      him beyond the bounds of discretion, proved at last sufficient to

      reinstate him in his former authority, and finally to render his reign the

      most triumphant that is to be met with in English story; though for the

      present he was obliged, with some loss of honor, to yield to the current

      which bore so strongly against him.

     

      The parliament framed an act which was likely to produce considerable

      innovations in the government. They premised, that, whereas the Great

      Charter had, to the manifest peril and slander of the king and damage of

      his people, been violated in many points, particularly by the imprisonment

      of freemen and the seizure of their goods, without suit, indictment, or

      trial, it was necessary to confirm it anew, and to oblige all the chief

      officers of the law, together with the steward and chamberlain of the

      household, the keeper of the privy seal, the controller and treasurer of

      the wardrobe, and those who were intrusted with the education of the young

      prince, to swear to the regular observance of it. They also remarked, that

      the peers of the realm had formerly been arrested and imprisoned, and

      dispossessed of their temporalities and lands, and even some of them put

      to death, without judgment or trial; and they therefore enacted that such

      violences should henceforth cease, and no peer be punished but by the

      award of his peers “in parliament.” They required, that, whenever any of

      the great offices above mentioned became vacant, the king should fill it

      by the advice of his council, and the consent of such barons as should at

      that time be found to reside in the neighborhood of the court. And they

      enacted, that, on the third day of every session, the king should resume

      into his own hand all these offices, except those of justices of the two

      benches and the barons of exchequer; that the ministers should for the

      time be reduced to private persons; that they should in that condition

      answer before parliament to any accusation brought against them; and that

      if they were found anywise guilty, they should finally be dispossessed of

      their offices, and more able persons be substituted in their place.[*] By

      these last regulations, the barons approached as near as they durst to

      those restrictions which had formerly been imposed on Henry III. and

      Edward II., and which, from the dangerous consequences attending them, had

      become so generally odious, that they did not expect to have either the

      concurrence of the people in demanding the*n, or the assent of the present

      king in granting them.

     

      * 15 Edward III.

     

      In return for these important concessions, the parliament offered the king

      a grant of twenty thousand sacks of wool; and his wants were so urgent

      from the clamors of his creditors and the demands of his foreign allies,

      that he was obliged to accept of the supply on these hard conditions. He

      ratified this statute in full parliament: but he secretly entered a

      protest of such a nature as was sufficient, one should imagine to destroy

      all future trust and confidence with his people; he declared that, as soon

      as his convenience permitted, he would, from his own authority, revoke

      what had been extorted from him.[*] Accordingly he was no sooner possessed

      of the parliamentary supply, than he issued an edict, which contains many

      extraordinary positions and pretensions. He first asserts, that that

      statute had been enacted contrary to law, as if a free legislative body

      could ever do any thing illegal. He next affirms, that as it was hurtful

      to the prerogatives of the crown, which he had sworn to defend, he had

      only dissembled when he seemed to ratify it, but that he had never in his

      own breast given his assent to it. He does not pretend that either he or

      the parliament lay under force; but only that some inconvenience would

      have ensued, had he not seemingly affixed his sanction to that pretended

      statute. He therefore, with the advice of his council and of some earls

      and barons, abrogates and annuls it; and though he professes himself

      willing and determined to observe such articles of it as were formerly

      law, he declares it to have thenceforth no force or authority.[**] The

      parliaments that were afterwards assembled took no notice of this

      arbitrary exertion of royal power, which, by a parity of reason, left all

      their laws at the mercy of the king; and, during the course of two years,

      Edward had so far reÃ«stablished his influence, and freed himself from his

      present necessities, that he then obtained from his parliament a legal

      repeal of the obnoxious statute.[***] This transaction certainly contains

      remarkable circumstances, which discover the manners and sentiments of the

      age; and may prove what inaccurate work might be expected from such rude

      hands, when employed in legislation, and in rearing the delicate fabric of

      laws and a constitution.

     

      But though Edward had happily recovered his authority at home, which had

      been impaired by the events of the French war, he had undergone so many

      mortifications from that attempt.

     

      John III., duke of Brittany, had, during some years, found himself

      declining through age and infirmities; and having no issue, he was

      solicitous to prevent those disorders to which, on the event of his

      demise, a disputed succession might expose his subjects. His younger

      brother, the count of Penthiev had left only one daughter, whom the duke

      deemed his heir; and as his family had inherited the duchy by a female

      succession, he thought her title preferable to that of the count of

      Mountfort, who, being his brother by a second marriage, was the male heir

      of that principality.[*] He accordingly purposed to bestow his niece in

      marriage on some person who might be able to defend her rights; and he

      cast his eye on Charles of Blois, nephew of the king of France, by his

      mother, Margaret of Valois, sister to that monarch. But as he both loved

      his subjects and was beloved by them, he determined not to take this

      important step without their approbation; and having assembled the states

      of Brittany, he represented to them the advantages of that alliance, and

      the prospect which it gave of an entire settlement of the succession. The

      Bretons willingly concurred in his choice: the marriage was concluded: all

      his vassals, and among the rest the count of Mountfort, swore fealty to

      Charles and to his consort, as to their future sovereigns; and every

      danger of civil commotions seemed to be obviated, as far as human prudence

      could provide a remedy against them.

     

      But on the death of this good prince, the ambition of the count of

      Mountfort broke through all these regulations, and kindled a war, not only

      dangerous to Brittany, but to a great part of Europe. While Charles of

      Blois was soliciting at the court of France the investiture of the duchy,

      Mountfort was active in acquiring immediate possession of it; and by force

      or intrigue he made himself master of Rennes, Nantz, Brest Hennebonne, and

      all the most important fortresses, and engaged many considerable barons to

      acknowledge his authority.[**] Sensible that he could expect no favor from

      Philip, he made a voyage to England, on pretence of soliciting his claim

      to the earldom of Richmond, which had devolved to him by his brother’s

      death; and there, offering to do homage to Edward, as king of France, for

      the duchy of Brittany, he proposed a strict alliance for the support of

      their mutual pretensions.

     

      Edward saw immediately the advantages attending this treaty: Mountfort, an

      active and valiant prince, closely united to him by interest, opened at

      once an entrance into the heart of France, and afforded him much more

      flattering views than his allies on the side of Germany and the Low

      Countries, who had no sincere attachment to his cause, and whose progress

      was also obstructed by those numerous fortifications which had been raised

      on that frontier. Robert of Artois was zealous in enforcing these

      considerations: the ambitious spirit of Edward was little disposed to sit

      down under those repulses which he had received, and which he thought had

      so much impaired his reputation; and it required a very short negotiation

      to conclude a treaty of alliance between two men, who, though their pleas

      with regard to the preference of male or female succession were directly

      opposite, were intimately connected by their immediate interests.[*]

     

      As this treaty was still a secret, Mountfort, on his return, ventured to

      appear at Paris, in order to defend his cause before the court of peers;

      but observing Philip and his judges to be prepossessed against his title,

      and dreading their intentions of arresting him, till he should restore

      what he had seized by violence, he suddenly made his escape; and war

      immediately commenced between him and Charles of Blois.[**] Philip sent

      his eldest son, the duke of Normandy, with a powerful army, to the

      assistance of the latter; and Mountfort, unable to keep the field against

      his rival, remained in the city of Nantz, where he was besieged. The city

      was taken by the treachery of the inhabitants; Mountfort fell into the

      hands of his enemies, was conducted as a prisoner to Paris, and was shut

      up in the tower of the Louvre.[***]

     

      1342.

     

      This event seemed to put an end to the pretensions of the count of

      Mountfort; but his affairs were immediately retrieved by an unexpected

      incident, which inspired new life and vigor into his party. Jane of

      Flanders, countess of Mountfort, the most extraordinary woman of the age,

      was roused, by the captivity of her husband, from those domestic cares to

      which she had hitherto limited her genius; and she courageously undertook

      to support the falling fortunes of her family No sooner did she receive

      the fatal intelligence, than she assembled the inhabitants of Rennes,

      where she then resided; and carrying her infant son in her arms, deplored

      to them the calamity of their sovereign. She recommended to their care the

      illustrious orphan, the sole male remaining of their ancient princes, who

      had governed them with such indulgence and lenity, and to whom they had

      ever professed the most zealous attachment. She declared herself willing

      to run all hazards with them in so just a cause; discovered the resources

      which still remained in the alliance of England; and entreated them to

      make one effort against a usurper, who, being imposed on them by the arms

      of France, would in return make a sacrifice to his protector of the

      ancient liberties of Brittany. The audience, moved by the affecting

      appearance, and inspirited by the noble conduct of the princess, vowed to

      live and die with her in defending the rights of her family: all the other

      fortresses of Brittany embraced the same resolution: the countess went

      from place to place encouraging the garrisons, providing them with every

      thing necessary for subsistence, and concerting the proper plans of

      defence; and after she had put the whole province in a good posture, she

      shut herself up in Hennebonne, where she waited with impatience the

      arrival of those succors which Edward had promised her. Meanwhile she sent

      over her son to England, that she might both put him in a place of safety,

      and engage the king more strongly, by such a pledge, to embrace with zeal

      the interests of her family.

     

      Charles of Blois, anxious to make himself master of so important a

      fortress as Hennebonne, and still more to take the countess prisoner, from

      whose vigor and capacity all the difficulties to his succession in

      Brittany now proceeded, sat down before the place with a great army,

      composed of French, Spaniards, Genoese, and some Bretons; and he conducted

      the attack with indefatigable industry.[*]

     

      The defence was no less vigorous: the besiegers were repulsed in every

      assault: frequent sallies were made with success by the garrison; and the

      countess herself being the most forward in all military operations, every

      one was ashamed not to exert himself to the utmost in this desperate

      situation. One day, she perceived that the besiegers, entirely occupied in

      an attack, had neglected a distant quarter of their camp; and she

      immediately sallied forth at the head of a body of two hundred cavalry,

      threw them into confusion, did great execution upon them, and set fire to

      their tents, baggage, and magazines; but when she was preparing to return,

      she found that she was intercepted, and that a considerable body of the

      enemy had thrown themselves between her and the gates. She instantly took

      her resolution; she ordered her men to disband, and to make the best of

      their way by flight to Brest; she met them at the appointed place of

      rendezvous, collected another body of five hundred horse, returned to

      Hennebonne, broke unexpectedly through the enemy’s camp, and was received

      with shouts and acclamations by the garrison, who, encouraged by this

      reÃ«nforcement, and by so rare an example of female valor, determined to

      defend themselves to the last extremity.

     

      The reiterated attacks, however, of the besiegers had at length made

      several breaches in the walls; and it was apprehended that a general

      assault, which was every hour expected would overpower the garrison,

      diminished in numbers, and extremely weakened with watching and fatigue.

      It became necessary to treat of a capitulation; and the bishop of Leon was

      already engaged, for that purpose, in a conference with Charles of Blois,

      when the countess, who had mounted to a high tower, and was looking

      towards the sea with great impatience, descried some sails at a distance.

      She immediately exclaimed, “Behold the succors! the English succors! No

      capitulation!”[*] This fleet had on board a body of heavy-armed cavalry,

      and six thousand archers, whom Edward had prepared for the relief of

      Hennebonne, but who had been long detained by contrary winds. They entered

      the harbor under the command of Sir Walter Manny, one of the bravest

      captains of England: and having inspired fresh courage into the garrison,

      immediately sallied forth, beat the besiegers from all their posts, and

      obliged them to decamp.

     

      But notwithstanding this success, the countess of Mountfort found that her

      party, overpowered by numbers, was declining in every quarter; and she

      went over to solicit more effectual succors from the king of England.

      Edward granted her a considerable reÃ«nforcement under Robert of Artois,

      who embarked on board a fleet of forty-five ships, and sailed to Brittany.

      He was met in his passage by the enemy; an action ensued, where the

      countess behaved with her wonted valor, and charged the enemy sword in

      hand; but the hostile fleets, after a sharp action, were separated by a

      storm, and the English arrived safely in Brittany. The first exploit of

      Robert was the taking of Vannes, which he mastered by conduct and

      address;[*] but he survived a very little time this prosperity. The Breton

      noblemen of the party of Charles assembled secretly in arms, attacked

      Vannes of a sudden, and carried the place; chiefly by reason of a wound

      received by Robert, of which he soon after died at sea, on his return to

      England.[**]

     

      After the death of this unfortunate prince, the chief author of all the

      calamities with which his country was overwhelmed for more than a century,

      Edward undertook in person the defence of the countess of Mountfort; and

      as the last truce with France was now expired, the war, which the English

      and French had hitherto carried on as allies to the competitors for

      Brittany, was thenceforth conducted in the name and under the standard of

      the two monarchs. The king landed at Morbian, near Vannes, with an army of

      twelve thousand men; and being master of the field, he endeavored to give

      a lustre to his arms, by commencing at once three important sieges, that

      of Vannes, of Rennes, and of Nantz. But by undertaking too much, he failed

      of success in all his enterprises. Even the siege of Vannes, which Edward

      in person conducted with vigor, advanced but slowly;[***] and the French

      had all the leisure requisite for making preparations against him.

     

      The duke of Normandy, eldest son of Philip, appeared in Brittany at the

      head of an army of thirty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry; and

      Edward was now obliged to draw together all his forces, and to intrench

      himself strongly before Vannes, where the duke of Normandy soon after

      arrived, and in a manner invested the besiegers. The garrison and the

      French camp were plentifully supplied with provisions; while the English,

      who durst not make any attempt upon the place in the presence of a

      superior army, drew all their subsistence from England, exposed to the

      hazards of the sea, and sometimes to those which arose from the fleet of

      the enemy.

     

      1243.

     

      In this dangerous situation, Edward willingly hearkened to the mediation

      of the pope’s legates, the cardinals of Palestrine and Frescati, who

      endeavored to negotiate, if not a peace, at east a truce, between the two

      kingdoms. A treaty was concluded for a cessation of arms during three

      years;[*] and Edward had the abilities, notwithstanding his present

      dangerous situation, to procure to himself very equal and honorable terms,

      It was agreed that Vannes should be sequestered, during the truce, in the

      hands of the legates, to be disposed of afterwards as they pleased; and

      though Edward knew the partiality of the court of Rome towards his

      antagonists, he saved himself by this device from the dishonor of having

      undertaken a fruitless enterprise. It was also stipulated, that all

      prisoners should be released, that the places in Brittany should remain in

      the hands of the present possessors, and that the allies on both sides

      should be comprehended in the truce.[**] Edward, soon after concluding

      this treaty, embarked with his army for England.

     

      The truce, though calculated for a long time, was of very short duration;

      and each monarch endeavored to throw on the other the blame of its

      infraction. Of course the historians of the two countries differ in their

      account of the matter. It seems probable, however, as is affirmed by the

      French writers, that Edward, in consenting to the truce, had no other view

      than to extricate himself from a perilous situation into which he had

      fallen, and was afterwards very careless in observing it. In all the

      memorials which remain on this subject, he complains chiefly of the

      punishment inflicted on Oliver de Clisson, John de Montauban, and other

      Breton noblemen, who, he says, were partisans of the family of Mountfort,

      and consequently under the protection of England.[***] But it appears

      that, at the conclusion of the truce, those noblemen had openly, by their

      declarations and actions, embraced the cause of Charles of Blois;[****]

      and if they had entered into any secret correspondence and engagements

      with Edward, they were traitors to their party, and were justly punishable

      by Philip and Charles for their breach of faith; nor had Edward any ground

      of complaint against France for such severities.

     

      1344.

     

      But when he laid these pretended injuries before the parliament, whom he

      affected to consult on all occasions, that assembly entered into the

      quarrel, advised the king not to be amused by a fraudulent truce, and

      granted him supplies for the renewal of the war: the counties were charged

      with a fifteenth for two years, and the boroughs with a tenth. The clergy

      consented to give a tenth for three years.

     

      These supplies enabled the king to complete his military preparations; and

      he sent his cousin, Henry, earl of Derby, son of the earl of Lancaster,

      into Guienne, for the defence of that province.[*] This prince, the most

      accomplished in the English court, possessed to a high degree the virtues

      of justice and humanity, as well as those of valor and conduct;[**] and

      not content with protecting and cherishing the province committed to his

      care, he made a successful invasion on the enemy. He attacked the count of

      Lisle, the French general, at Bergerac, beat him from his intrenchments,

      and took the place. He reduced a great part of Perigord, and continually

      advanced in his conquests, till the count of Lisle, having collected an

      army of ten or twelve thousand men, sat down before Auberoche, in hopes of

      recovering that place, which had fallen into the hands of the English.

     

      1345.

     

      The earl of Derby came upon him by surprise with only a thousand cavalry,

      threw the French into disorder, pushed his advantage, and obtained a

      complete victory. Lisle himself, with many considerable nobles, was taken

      prisoner.[***] After this important success, Derby made a rapid progress

      in subduing the French provinces. He took Monsegur, Monpesat,

      Villefranche, Miremont, and Tonnins, with the fortress of Damassen.

      Aiguillon, a fortress deemed impregnable, fell into his hands from the

      cowardice of the governor. Angouleme was surrendered after a short siege.

      The only place where he met with considerable resistance, was Reole,

      which, however, was at last reduced, after a siege of above nine

      weeks.[****] He made an attempt on Blaye, but thought it more prudent to

      raise the siege than waste his time before a place of small

      importance.[*****]

     

      1346.

     

      The reason why Derby was permitted to make, without opposition, such

      progress on the side of Guienne, was the difficulties under which the

      French finances then labored, and which had obliged Philip to lay on new

      impositions, particularly the duty on salt, to the great discontent, and

      almost mutiny, of his subjects. But after the court of France was supplied

      with money, great preparations were made: and the duke of Normandy,

      attended by the duke of Burgundy and other great nobility, led towards

      Guienne a powerful army, which the English could not think of resisting in

      the open field. The earl of Derby stood on the defensive, and allowed the

      French to carry on at leisure the siege of Angouleme, which was their

      first enterprise. John Lord Norwich, the governor, after a brave and

      vigorous defence, found himself reduced to such extremities as obliged him

      to employ a stratagem, in order to save his garrison, and to prevent his

      being reduced to surrender at discretion. He appeared on the walls, and

      desired a parley with the duke of Normandy. The prince there told Norwich,

      that he supposed he intended to capitulate. “Not at all,” replied the

      governor: “but as to-morrow is the feast of the Virgin, to whom I know

      that you, sir, as well as myself, bear a great devotion, I desire a

      cessation of arms for that day.” The proposal was agreed to; and Norwich,

      having ordered his forces to prepare all their baggage, marched out next

      day, and advanced towards the French camp. The besiegers, imagining they

      were to be attacked, ran to their arms; but Norwich sent a messenger to

      the duke, reminding him of his engagement. The duke, who piqued himself on

      faithfully keeping his word exclaimed, “I see the governor has outwitted

      me: but let us be content with gaining the place.” And the English were

      allowed to pass through the camp unmolested.[*] After some other

      successes, the duke of Normandy laid siege to Aiguillon; and as the

      natural strength of the fortress, together with a brave garrison under the

      command of the earl of Pembroke and Sir Walter Manny, rendered it

      impossible to take the place by assault, he purposed, after making several

      fruitless attacks,[**] to reduce it by famine: but before he could finish

      this enterprise, he was called to another quarter of the kingdom by one of

      the greatest disasters that ever befell the French monarchy.[***]

     

      Edward, informed by the earl of Derby of the great danger to which Guienne

      was exposed, had prepared a force with which he intended in person to

      bring it relief. He embarked at Southampton on board a fleet of near a

      thousand sail of all dimensions; and carried with him, besides all the

      chief nobility of England, his eldest son, the prince of Wales, now

      fifteen years of age. The winds proved long contrary;[*] and the king, in

      despair of arriving in time at Guienne, was at last persuaded, by Geoffrey

      d’Harcourt, to change the destination of his enterprise. This nobleman was

      a Norman by birth, had long made a considerable figure in the court of

      France, and was generally esteemed for his personal merit and his valor;

      but being disobliged and persecuted by Philip, he had fled into England;

      had recommended himself to Edward, who was an excellent judge of men; and

      had succeeded to Robert of Artois in the invidious office of exciting and

      assisting the king in every enterprise against his native country. He had

      long insisted, that an expedition to Normandy promised, in the present

      circumstances, more favorable success than one to Guienne; that Edward

      would find the northern provinces almost destitute of military force,

      which had been drawn to the south; that they were full of flourishing

      cities, whose plunder would enrich the English; that their cultivated

      fields, as yet unspoiled by war, would supply them with plenty of

      provisions; and that the neighborhood of the capital rendered every event

      of importance in those quarters.[**] These reasons, which had not before

      been duly weighed by Edward, began to make more impression after the

      disappointments which he had met with in his voyage to Guienne: he ordered

      his fleet to sail to Normandy, and safely disembarked his army at La

      Hogue.

     

      This army, which, during the course of the ensuing campaign, was crowned

      with the most splendid success, consisted of four thousand men at arms,

      ten thousand archers, ten thousand Welsh infantry, and six thousand Irish.

      The Welsh and the Irish were light, disorderly troops, fitter for doing

      execution in a pursuit, or scouring the country, than for any stable

      action. The bow was always esteemed a frivolous weapon, where true

      military discipline was known, and regular bodies of well-armed foot

      maintained. The only solid force in this army were the men at arms; and

      even these, being cavalry, were on that account much inferior in the shock

      of battle to good infantry: and as the whole were new-levied troops, we

      are led to entertain a very mean idea of the military force of those ages,

      which, being ignorant of every other art, had not properly cultivated the

      art of war itself, the sole object of general attention.

     

      The king created the earl of Arundel constable of his army and the earls

      of Warwick and Harcourt mareschals: he bestowed the honor of knighthood on

      the prince of Wales and several of the young nobility, immediately upon

      his landing. After destroying all the ships in La Hogue, Barfleur, and

      Cherbourg, he spread his army over the whole country, and gave them an

      unbounded license of burning, spoiling, and plundering every place of

      which they became masters. The loose discipline then prevalent could not

      be much hurt by these disorderly practices; and Edward took care to

      prevent any surprise, by giving orders to his troops, however they might

      disperse themselves in the day-time, always to quarter themselves at night

      near the main body. In this manner, Montebourg, Carentan, St. Lo,

      Valognes, and other places in the Cotentin, were pillaged without

      resistance; and a universal consternation was spread over the province.[*]

     

      The intelligence of this unexpected invasion soon reached Paris, and threw

      Philip into great perplexity. He issued orders, however, for levying

      forces in all quarters, and despatched the count of Eu, constable of

      France, and the count of Tancarville, with a body of troops, to the

      defence of Caen, a populous and commercial but open city, which lay in the

      neighborhood of the English army. The temptation of so rich a prize soon

      allured Edward to approach it; and the inhabitants, encouraged by their

      numbers, and by the reÃ«nforcements which they daily received from the

      country, ventured to meet him in the field. But their courage failed them

      on the first shock: they fled with precipitation: the counts of Eu and

      Tancarville were taken prisoners: the victors entered the city along with

      the vanquished, and a furious massacre commenced, without distinction of

      age, sex, or condition. The citizens, in despair, barricaded their and

      assaulted the English with stones, bricks, and every missile weapon: the

      English made way by fire to the destruction of the citizens; till Edward,

      anxious to save both his spoil and his soldiers, stopped the massacre; and

      having obliged the inhabitants to lay down their arms, gave his troops

      license to begin a more regular and less hazardous plunder of the city.

      The pillage continued for three days: the king reserved for his own share

      the jewels, plate, silks, fine cloth, and fine linen; and he bestowed all

      the remainder of the spoil on his army. The whole was embarked on board

      the ships, and sent over to England, together with three hundred of the

      richest citizens of Caen, whose ransom was an additional profit, which he

      expected afterwards to levy.[*] This dismal scene passed in the presence

      of two cardinal legates, who had come to negotiate a peace between the

      kingdoms.

     

      The king moved next to Rouen, in hopes of treating that city in the same

      manner; but found that the bridge over the Seine was already broken down,

      and that the king of France himself was arrived there with his army. He

      marched along the banks of that river towards Paris, destroying the whole

      country, and every town and village which he met with on his road.[**]

      Some of his light troops carried their ravages even to the gates of Paris;

      and the royal palace of St. Germains, together with Nanterre, Ruelle, and

      other villages, was reduced to ashes within sight of the capital.

     

      The English intended to pass the river at Poissy, but found the French

      army encamped on the opposite banks, and the bridge at that place, as well

      as all others over the Seine, broken down by orders from Philip. Edward

      now saw that the French meant to enclose him in their country, in hopes of

      attacking him with advantage on all sides: but he saved himself by a

      stratagem from this perilous situation. He gave his army orders to

      dislodge, and to advance farther up the Seine; but immediately returning

      by the same road, he arrived at Poissy, which the enemy had already

      quitted, in order to attend his motions. He repaired the bridge with

      incredible celerity, passed over his army, and having thus disengaged

      himself from the enemy, advanced by quick marches towards Flanders. His

      vanguard, commanded by Harcourt, met with the townsmen of Amiens, who were

      hastening to reÃ«nforce their king, and defeated them with great

      slaughter;[*] he passed by Beauvais, and burned the suburbs of that city:

      but as he approached the Somme, he found himself in the same difficulty as

      before; all the bridges on that river were either broken down or strongly

      guarded: an army, under the command of Godemar de Faye, was stationed on

      the opposite banks: Philip was advancing on him from the other quarter,

      with an army of a hundred thousand men; and he was thus exposed to the

      danger of being enclosed, and of starving in an enemy’s country. In this

      extremity, he published a reward to any one that should bring him

      intelligence of a passage over the Somme. A peasant, called Gobin Agace,

      whose name has been preserved by the share which he had in these important

      transactions, was tempted on this occasion to betray the interests of his

      country; and he informed Edward of a ford below Abbeville, which had a

      sound bottom, and might be passed without difficulty at low water.[**] The

      king hastened thither, but found Godemar de Faye on the opposite banks.

      Being urged by necessity, he deliberated not a moment; but threw himself

      into the river, sword in hand, at the head of his troops; drove the enemy

      from their station; and pursued them to a distance on the plain.[***] The

      French army under Philip arrived at the ford, when the rearguard of the

      English were passing: so narrow was the escape which Edward, by his

      prudence and celerity, made from this danger! The rising of the tide

      prevented the French king from following him over the ford, and obliged

      that prince to take his route over the bridge at Abbeville; by which some

      time was lost.

     

      It is natural to think that Philip, at the head of so vast an army, was

      impatient to take revenge on the English, and to prevent the disgrace to

      which he must be exposed if an inferior enemy should be allowed, after

      ravaging so great a part of his kingdom, to escape with impunity. Edward

      also was sensible that such must be the object of the French monarch; and

      as he had advanced but a little way before his enemy, he saw the danger of

      precipitating his march over the plains of Picardy, and of exposing his

      rear to the insults of the numerous cavalry in which the French camp

      abounded. He took, therefore, a prudent resolution: he chose his ground

      with advantage near the village of Crecy; he disposed his army in

      excellent older; he determined to await in tranquillity the arrival of the

      enemy; and he hoped that their eagerness to engage, and to prevent his

      retreat, after all their past disappointments would hurry them on to some

      rash and ill-concerted action. He drew up his army on a gentle ascent, and

      divided them into three lines: the first was commanded by the prince of

      Wales, and under him by the earls of Warwick and Oxford, by Harcourt, and

      by the lords Chandos, Holland, and other noblemen: the earls of Arundel

      and Northampton, with the lords Willoughby, Basset, Roos, and Sir Lewis

      Tufton, were at the head of the second line: he took to himself the

      command of the third division, by which he purposed either to bring succor

      to the two first lines, or to secure a retreat in case of any misfortune,

      or to push his advantages against the enemy. He had likewise the

      precaution to throw up trenches on his flanks, in order to secure himself

      from the numerous bodies of the French who might assail him from that

      quarter; and he placed all his baggage behind him in a wood, which he also

      secured by an intrenchment.[*]

     

      The skill and order of this disposition, with the tranquillity in which it

      was made, served extremely to compose the minds of the soldiers; and the

      king, that he might further inspirit them, rode through the ranks with

      such an air of cheerfulness and alacrity, as conveyed the highest

      confidence into every beholder. He pointed out to them the necessity to

      which they were reduced, and the certain and inevitable destruction which

      awaited them, if, in their present situation, enclosed on all hands in an

      enemy’s country, they trusted to any thing but their own valor, or gave

      that enemy an opportunity of taking revenge for the many insults and

      indignities which they had of late put upon him. He reminded them of the

      visible ascendant which they had hitherto maintained over all the bodies

      of French troops that had fallen in their way; and assured them, that the

      superior numbers of the army which at present hovered over them, gave them

      not greater force, but was an advantage easily compensated by the order in

      which he had placed his own army, and the resolution which he expected

      from them. He demanded nothing, he said, but that they would imitate his

      own example, and that of the prince of Wales: and as the honor, the lives,

      the liberties of all, were now exposed to the same danger, he was

      confident that they would make one common effort to extricate themselves

      from the present difficulties, and that their united courage would give

      them the victory over all their enemies.

     

      It is related by some historians,[*] that Edward, besides the resources

      which he found in his own genius and presence of mind, employed also a new

      invention against the enemy, and placed in his front some pieces of

      artillery, the first that had yet been made use of on any remarkable

      occasion in Europe. This is the epoch of one of the most singular

      discoveries that has been made among men; a discovery which changed by

      degrees the whole art of war, and by consequence many circumstances in the

      political government of Europe. But the ignorance of that age in the

      mechanical arts, rendered the progress of this new invention very slow.

      The artillery first framed were so clumsy, and of such difficult

      management, that men were not immediately sensible of their use and

      efficacy and even to the present times improvements have been continually

      making on this furious engine, which, though it seemed contrived for the

      destruction of mankind, and the overthrow of empires, has in the issue

      rendered battles less bloody, and has given greater stability to civil

      societies. Nations, by its means, have been brought more to a level:

      conquests have become less frequent and rapid: success in war has been

      reduced nearly to be a matter of calculation: and any nation, overmatched

      by its enemies, either yields to their demands or secures itself by

      alliances against their violence and invasion.

     

      The invention of artillery was at this time known in France as well as in

      England;[**] but Philip, in his hurry to overtake the enemy, had probably

      left his cannon behind him, which he regarded as a useless encumbrance.

      All his other movements discovered the same imprudence and precipitation.

      Impelled by anger, a dangerous counsellor, and trusting to the great

      superiority of his numbers, he thought that all depended on forcing an

      engagement with the English; and that if he could once reach the enemy in

      their retreat, the victory on his side was certain and inevitable. He made

      a hasty march, in some confusion, from Abbeville; but after he had

      advanced above two leagues, some gentlemen, whom he had sent before to

      take a view of the enemy, returned to him, and brought him intelligence

      that they had seen the English drawn up in Bombarda great order, and

      awaiting his arrival.

     

      They therefore devised him to defer the combat till the ensuing day, when

      his army would have recovered from their fatigue, and might be disposed

      into better order than their present hurry had permitted them to observe.

      Philip assented to this counsel; but the former precipitation of his

      march, and the impatience of the French nobility, made it impracticable

      for him to put it in execution. One division pressed upon another: orders

      to stop were not seasonably conveyed to all of them: this immense body was

      not governed by sufficient discipline to be manageable; and the French

      army, imperfectly formed into three lines, arrived, already fatigued and

      disordered, in presence of the enemy. The first line, consisting of

      fifteen thousand Genoese cross-bow men, was commanded by Anthony Doria and

      Charles Grimaldi: the second was led by the count of AlenÃ§on, brother to

      the king: the king himself was at the head of the third. Besides the

      French monarch, there were no less than three crowned heads in this

      engagement; the king of Bohemia, the king of the Romans, his son, and the

      king of Majorca; with all the nobility and great vassals of the crown of

      France. The army now consisted of above one hundred and twenty thousand

      men, more than three times the number of the enemy. But the prudence of

      one man was superior to the advantage of all this force and splendor.

     

      The English, on the approach of the enemy, kept their ranks firm and

      immovable; and the Genoese first began the attack. There had happened, a

      little before the engagement, a thunder shower, which had moistened and

      relaxed the strings of the Genoese cross-bows; their arrows for this

      reason fell short of the enemy. The English archers, taking their bows out

      of their cases, poured in a shower of arrows upon this multitude who were

      opposed to them, and soon threw them into disorder. The Genoese fell back

      upon the heavy-armed cavalry of the count of AlenÃ§on;[*] who, enraged at

      their cowardice, ordered his troops to put them to the sword.

     

      The artillery fired amidst the crowd; the English archers continued to

      send in their arrows among them; and nothing was to be seen in that vast

      body but hurry and confusion, terror and dismay. The young prince of Wales

      had the presence of mind to take advantage of this situation, and to lead

      on his line to the charge. The French cavalry, however, recovering

      somewhat their order, and encouraged by the example of their leader, made

      a stout resistance; and having at last cleared themselves of the Genoese

      runaways, advanced upon their enemies, and by their superior numbers began

      to hem them round. The earls of Arundel and Northampton now advanced their

      line to sustain the prince, who, ardent in his first feats of arms, set an

      example of valor which was imitated by all his followers. The battle

      became for some time hot and dangerous, and the earl of Warwick,

      apprehensive of the event, from the superior numbers of the French,

      despatched a messenger to the king, and entreated him to send succors to

      the relief of the prince. Edward had chosen his station on the top of the

      hill; and he surveyed in tranquillity the scene of action. When the

      messenger accosted him, his first question was, whether the prince were

      slain or wounded. On receiving an answer in the negative, “Return,” said

      he, “to my son, and tell him that I reserve the honor of the day to him: I

      am confident that he will show himself worthy of the honor of knighthood

      which I so lately conferred upon him: he will be able, without my

      assistance, to repel the enemy.”[*] This speech, being reported to the

      prince and his attendants, inspired them with fresh courage: they made an

      attack with redoubled vigor on the French, in which the count of AlenÃ§on

      was slain: that whole line of cavalry was thrown into disorder: the riders

      were killed or dismounted: the Welsh infantry rushed into the throng, and

      with their long knives cut the throats of all who had fallen; nor was any

      quarter given that day by the victors.[**]

     

      The king of France advanced in vain with the rear to sustain the line

      commanded by his brother: he found them already discomfited; and the

      example of their rout increased the confusion which was before but too

      prevalent in his own body. He had himself a horse killed under him: he was

      remounted; and, though left almost alone, he seemed still determined to

      maintain the combat; when John of Hainault seized the reins of his bridle,

      turned about his horse, and carried him off the field of battle. The whole

      French army took to flight, and was followed and put to the sword without

      mercy by the enemy, till the darkness of the night put an end to the

      pursuit. The king, on his return to the camp, flew into the arms of the

      prince of Wales, and exclaimed, “My brave son persevere in your honorable

      course: you are my son! for valiantly have you acquitted yourself to-day:

      you have shown yourself worthy of empire.”[*]

     

      This battle, which is known by the name of the battle of Crecy, began

      after three o’clock in the afternoon, and continued till evening. The next

      morning was foggy; and as the English observed that many of the enemy had

      lost their way in the night and in the mist, they employed a stratagem to

      bring them into their power: they erected on the eminences some French

      standards which they had taken in the battle, and all who were allured by

      this false signal were put to the sword, and no quarter given them. In

      excuse for this inhumanity, it was alleged that the French king had given

      like orders to his troops; but the real reason probably was, that the

      English, in their present situation, did not choose to be encumbered with

      prisoners. On the day of battle, and on the ensuing, there fell, by a

      moderate computation, one thousand two hundred French knights, one

      thousand four hundred gentlemen, four thousand men at arms, besides about

      thirty thousand of inferior rank:[**] many of the principal nobility of

      France, the dukes of Lorraine and Bourbon, the earls of Flanders, Blois,

      Vaudemont, Aumale, were left on the field of battle. The kings also of

      Bohemia and Majorca were slain: the fate of the former was remarkable: he

      was blind from age; but being resolved to hazard his person, and set an

      example to others, he ordered the reins of his bridle to be tied on each

      side to the horses of two gentlemen of his train; and his dead body, and

      those of his attendants, were afterwards found among the slain, with their

      horses standing by them in that situation.[***] His crest was three

      ostrich feathers; and his motto these German words, Ich dien,—“I

      serve;” which the prince of Wales and his successors adopted in memorial

      of this great victory. The action may seem no less remarkable for the

      small loss sustained by the English, than for the great slaughter of the

      French: there were killed in it only one esquire and three knights,[****]

      and very few of inferior rank; a demonstration that the prudent

      disposition planned by Edward, and the disorderly attack made by the

      French, had rendered the whole rather a rout than a battle, which was

      indeed the common case with engagements in those times.

     

      The great prudence of Edward appeared not only in obtaining this memorable

      victory, but in the measures which he pursued after it. Not elated by his

      present prosperity so far as to expect the total conquest of France, or

      even that of any considerable provinces, he purposed only to secure such

      an easy entrance into that kingdom, as might afterwards open the way to

      more moderate advantages. He knew the extreme distance of Guienne: he had

      experienced the difficulty and uncertainty of penetrating on the side of

      the Low Countries, and had already lost much of his authority over

      Flanders by the death of D’Arteville, who had been murdered by the

      populace themselves, his former partisans, on his attempting to transfer

      the sovereignty of that province to the prince of Wales.[*] The king,

      therefore, limited his ambition to the conquest of Calais; and after the

      interval of a few days, which he employed in interring the slain, he

      marched with his victorious army, and presented himself before the place.

     

      John of Vienne, a valiant knight of Burgundy, was governor of Calais, and

      being supplied with every thing necessary for defence, he encouraged the

      townsmen to perform to the utmost their duty to their king and country.

      Edward, therefore, sensible from the beginning that it was in vain to

      attempt the place by force, purposed only to reduce it by famine; he chose

      a secure station for his camp; drew intrenchments around the whole city;

      raised huts for his soldiers, which he covered with straw or broom; and

      provided his army with all the conveniences necessary to make them endure

      the winter season, which was approaching. As the governor soon perceived

      his intentions, he expelled all the useless mouths; and the king had the

      generosity to allow these unhappy people to pass through his camp, and he

      even supplied them with money for their journey.[**]

     

      While Edward was engaged in this siege, which employed him near a

      twelvemonth, there passed in different places many other events: and all

      to the honor of the English arms.

     

      The retreat of the duke of Normandy from Guienne left the earl of Derby

      master of the field; and he was not negligent in making his advantage of

      the superiority. He took Mirebeau by assault: he made himself master of

      Lusignan in the same manner: Taillebourg and St. Jean d’Angeli fell into

      his hands: Poictiers opened its gates to him; and Derby, having thus

      broken into the frontiers on that quarter, carried his incursions to the

      banks of the Loire, and filled all the southern provinces of France with

      horror and devastation.[*]

     

      The flames of war were at the same time kindled in Brittany. Charles of

      Blois invaded that province with a considerable army, and invested the

      fortress of Roche de Rien; but the countess of Mountfort, reÃ«nforced by

      some English troops under Sir Thomas Dagworth, attacked him during the

      night in his intrenchments, dispersed his army, and took Charles himself

      prisoner.[**] His wife, by whom he enjoyed his pretensions to Brittany,

      compelled by the present necessity, took on her the government of the

      party, and proved herself a rival in every shape, and an antagonist to the

      countess of Mountfort, both in the field and in the cabinet. And while

      these heroic dames presented this extraordinary scene to the world,

      another princess in England, of still higher rank, showed herself no less

      capable of exerting every manly virtue.

     

      The Scottish nation, after long defending, with incredible perseverance,

      their liberties against the superior force of the English, recalled their

      king, David Bruce, in 1342. Though that prince, neither by his age nor

      capacity, could bring them great assistance, he gave them the countenance

      of sovereign authority; and as Edward’s wars on the continent proved a

      great diversion to the force of England, they rendered the balance more

      equal between the kingdoms. In every truce which Edward concluded with

      Philip, the king of Scotland was comprehended; and when Edward made his

      last invasion upon France, David was strongly solicited by his ally to

      begin also hostilities, and to invade the northern counties of England.

      The nobility of his nation being always forward in such incursions, David

      soon mustered a great army, entered Northumberland at the head of above

      fifty thousand men, and carried his ravages and devastations to the gates

      of Durham.[***] But Queen Philippa, assembling a body of little more than

      twelve thousand men,[****] which she intrusted to the command of Lord

      Piercy, ventured to approach him at Neville’s Cross near that city; and

      riding through the ranks of her army, exhorted every man to do his duty,

      and to take revenge on these barbarous ravagers.[*****]

     

      Nor could she be persuaded to leave the field, till the armies were on the

      point of engaging. The Scots have often been unfortunate in the great

      pitched battles which they fought with the English; even though they

      commonly declined such engagements where the superiority of numbers was

      not on their side: but never did they receive a more fatal blow than the

      present. They were broken and chased off the field: fifteen thousand of

      them (some historians say twenty thousand) were slain; among whom were

      Edward Keith, earl mareschal, and Sir Thomas Charteris, chancellor: and

      the king himself was taken prisoner, with the earls of Sutherland, Fife,

      Monteith, Carrick, Lord Douglas, and many other noblemen.[*]

     

      Philippa, having secured her royal prisoner in the Tower,[**] crossed the

      sea at Dover; and was received in the English camp before Calais with all

      the triumph due to her rank, her merit, and her success. This age was the

      reign of chivalry and gallantry: Edward’s court excelled in these

      accomplishments as much as in policy and arms: and if any thing could

      justify the obsequious devotion then professed to the fair sex, it must be

      the appearance of such extraordinary women as shone forth during that

      period.

      1347.

     

      The town of Calais had been defended with remarkable vigilance, constancy,

      and bravery by the townsmen, during a siege of unusual length: but Philip,

      informed of their distressed condition, determined at last to attempt

      their relief; and he approached the English with an immense army, which

      the writers of that age make amount to two hundred thousand men. But he

      found Edward so surrounded with morasses, and secured by intrenchments,

      that, without running on inevitable destruction, he concluded it

      impossible to make an attempt on the English camp. He had no other

      resource than to send his rival a vain challenge to meet him in the open

      field; which being refused, he was obliged to decamp with his army, and

      disperse them into their several provinces.[***]

     

      John of Vienne, governor of Calais, now saw the necessity of surrendering

      his fortress, which was reduced to the last extremity by famine and the

      fatigue of the inhabitants. He appeared on the walls, and made a signal to

      the English sentinels that he desired a parley. Sir Walter Manny was sent

      to him by Edward. “Brave knight,” cried the governor “I have been

      intrusted by my sovereign with the command of this town: it is almost a

      year since you besieged me; and I have endeavored, as well as those under

      me, to do our duty. But you are acquainted with our present condition: we

      have no hopes of relief; we are perishing with hunger; I am willing

      therefore to surrender, and desire, as the sole condition, to insure the

      lives and liberties of these brave men, who have so long shared with me

      every danger and fatigue.” [*]

     

      Manny replied, that he was well acquainted with the intentions of the king

      of England; that that prince was incensed against the townsmen of Calais

      for their pertinacious resistance, and for the evils which they had made

      him and his subjects suffer; that he was determined to take exemplary

      vengeance on them; and would not receive the town on any condition which

      should confine him in the punishment of these offenders. “Consider,”

       replied Vienne, “that this is not the treatment to which brave men are

      entitled: if any English knight had been in my situation, your king would

      have expected the same conduct from him. The inhabitants of Calais have

      done for their sovereign what merits the esteem of every prince; much more

      of so gallant a prince as Edward. But I inform you, that, if we must

      perish, we shall not perish unrevenged; and that we are not yet so reduced

      but we can sell our lives at a high price to the victors. It is the

      interest of both sides to prevent these desperate extremities; and I

      expect that you yourself, brave knight, will interpose your good offices

      with your prince in our behalf.”

      

      Manny was struck with the justness of these sentiments, and represented to

      the king the danger of reprisals, if he should give such treatment to the

      inhabitants of Calais. Edward was at last persuaded to mitigate the rigor

      of the conditions demanded: he only insisted, that six of the most

      considerable citizens should be sent to him to be disposed of as he

      thought proper; that they should come to his camp carrying the keys of the

      city in their hands, bareheaded and barefooted, with ropes about their

      necks: and on these conditions he promised to spare the lives of all the

      remainder.[**]

     

      When this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, it struck the inhabitants

      with new consternation. To sacrifice six of their fellow-citizens to

      certain destruction for signalizing their valor in a common cause,

      appeared to them even more severe than that general punishment with which

      they were before threatened; and they found themselves incapable of coming

      to any resolution in so cruel and distressful a situation. At last, one of

      the principal inhabitants, called Eustace de St. Pierre, whose name

      deserves to be recorded, stepped forth, and declared himself willing to

      encounter death for the safety of his friends and companions: another,

      animated by his example, made a like generous offer: a third and a fourth

      presented themselves to the same fate; and the whole number was soon

      completed. These six heroic burgesses appeared before Edward in the guise

      of malefactors, laid at his feet the keys of their city, and were ordered

      to be led to execution. It is surprising that so generous a prince should

      ever have entertained such a barbarous purpose against such men; and still

      more that he should seriously persist in the resolution of executing

      it.[*] 7

      But the entreaties of his queen saved his memory from that infamy: she

      threw herself on her knees before him, and with tears in her eyes begged

      the lives of these citizens. Having obtained her request, she carried them

      into her tent, ordered a repast to be set before them, and, after making

      them a present of money and clothes, dismissed them in safety.[**]

     

      The king took possession of Calais; and immediately executed an act of

      rigor, more justifiable, because more necessary, than that which he had

      before resolved on. He knew that notwithstanding his pretended title to

      the crown of France, every Frenchman regarded him as a mortal enemy: he

      therefore ordered all the inhabitants of Calais to evacuate the town, and

      he peopled it anew with English; a policy which probably preserved so long

      to his successors the dominion of that important fortress. He made it the

      staple of wool, leather, tin, and lead; the four chief, if not the sole

      commodities of the kingdom, for which there was any considerable demand in

      foreign markets. All the English were obliged to bring thither these

      goods: foreign merchants came to the same place in order to purchase them:

      and at a period when posts were not established, and when the

      communication between states was so imperfect, this institution, though it

      hurt the navigation of England, was probably of advantage to the kingdom.

     

      1348.

     

      Through the mediation of the pope’s legates, Edward concluded a truce with

      France; but even during this cessation of arms, he had very nearly lost

      Calais, the sole fruit of all his boasted victories. The king had

      intrusted that place to Aimery de Pavie, an Italian, who had discovered

      bravery and conduct in the wars, but was utterly destitute of every

      principle of honor and fidelity. This man agreed to deliver up Calais for

      the sum of twenty thousand crowns; and Geoffrey de Charni, who commanded

      the French forces in those quarters, and who knew that, if he succeeded in

      this service, he should not be disavowed, ventured, without consulting his

      master, to conclude the bargain with him. Edward, informed of this

      treachery, by means of Aimery’s secretary, summoned the governor to London

      on other pretences; and having charged him with the guilt, promised him

      his life, but on condition that he would turn the contrivance to the

      destruction of the enemy. The Italian easily agreed to this double

      treachery. A day was appointed for the admission of the French; and Edward

      having prepared a force of about a thousand men, under Sir Walter Manny,

      secretly departed from London, carrying with him the prince of Wales; and,

      without being suspected, arrived the evening before at Calais. He made a

      proper disposition for the reception of the enemy, and kept all his forces

      and the garrison under arms. On the appearance of Charni, a chosen band of

      French soldiers was admitted at the postern, and Aimery, receiving the

      stipulated sum, promised that, with their assistance, he would immediately

      open the great gate to the troops, who were waiting with impatience for

      the fulfilling of his engagement.

     

      1349.

     

      All the French who entered were immediately slain or taken prisoners: the

      great gate opened: Edward rushed forth with cries of battle and of

      victory: the French, though astonished at the event, behaved with valor: a

      fierce and bloody engagement ensued. As the morning broke, the king, who

      was not distinguished by his arms, and who fought as a private man under

      the standard of Sir Walter Manny, remarked a French gentleman, called

      Eustace de Ribaumont, who exerted himself with singular vigor and bravery;

      and he was seized with a desire of trying a single combat with him. He

      stepped forth from his troop and challenging Ribaumont by name, (for he

      was known to him,) began a sharp and dangerous encounter. He was twice

      beaten to the ground by the valor of the Frenchman: he twice recovered

      himself: blows were redoubled with equal force on both sides: the victory

      was long undecided; till Ribaumont, perceiving himself to be left almost

      alone, called out to his antagonist, “Sir Knight, I yield myself your

      prisoner;” and at the same time delivered his sword to the king. Most of

      the French, being overpowered by numbers, and intercepted in their

      retreat, lost either their lives or their liberty.[*]

     

      The French officers who had fallen into the hands of the English, were

      conducted into Calais; where Edward discovered to them the antagonist with

      whom they had had the honor to be engaged, and treated them with great

      regard and courtesy. They were admitted to sup with the prince of Wales

      and the English nobility; and after supper, the king himself came into the

      apartment, and went about, conversing familiarly with one or other of his

      prisoners. He even addressed himself to Charni, and avoided reproaching

      him, in too severe terms, with the treacherous attempt which he had made

      upon Calais during the truce: but he openly bestowed the highest encomiums

      on Ribaumont; called him the most valorous knight that he had ever been

      acquainted with; and confessed that he himself had at no time been in so

      great danger as when engaged in combat with him. He then took a string of

      pearls, which he wore about his own head, and throwing it over the head of

      Ribaumont, he said to him, “Sir Eustace, I bestow this present upon you as

      a testimony of my esteem for your bravery; and I desire you to wear it a

      year for my sake. I know you to be gay and amorous; and to take delight in

      the company of ladies and damsels: let them all know from what hand you

      had the present. You are no longer a prisoner; I acquit you of your

      ransom; and you are at liberty to-morrow to dispose of yourself as you

      think proper.”

      

      Nothing proves more evidently the vast superiority assumed by the nobility

      and gentry above all the other orders of men, during those ages, than the

      extreme difference which Edward made in his treatment of these French

      knights, and that of the six citizens of Calais, who had exerted more

      signal bravery in a cause more justifiable and more honorable
