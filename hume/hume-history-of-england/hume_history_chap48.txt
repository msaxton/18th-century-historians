At the time when Sir Waller Raleigh was first confined in the Tower, his

violent and haughty temper had rendered him the most unpopular man in

England; and his condemnation was chiefly owing to that public odium under

which he labored. During the thirteen years’ imprisonment which he

suffered, the sentiments of the nation were much changed with regard to

him. Men had leisure to reflect on the hardship, not to say injustice, of

his sentence; they pitied his active and enterprising spirit, which

languished in the rigors of confinement; they were struck with the

extensive genius of the man, who, being educated amidst naval and military

enterprises, had surpassed, in the pursuits of literature, even those of

the most recluse and sedentary lives; and they admired his unbroken

magnanimity, which, at his age, and under his circumstances, could engage

him to undertake and execute so great a work as his History of the World.

To increase these favorable dispositions, on which he built the hopes of

recovering his liberty, he spread the report of a golden mine which he had

discovered in Guiana, and which was sufficient, according to his

representation, not only to enrich all the adventurers, but to afford

immense treasures to the nation. The king gave little credit to these

mighty promises; both because he believed that no such mine as the one

described was any where in nature, and because he considered Raleigh as a

man of desperate fortunes, whose business it was, by any means, to procure

his freedom, and to reinstate himself in credit and authority. Thinking,

however, that he had already undergone sufficient punishment, he released

him from the Tower; and when his vaunts of the golden mine had induced

multitudes to engage with him, the king gave them permission to try the

adventure, and, at their desire, he conferred on Raleigh authority over

his fellow-adventurers. Though strongly solicited, he still refused to

grant him a pardon, which he deemed a natural consequence, when he was

intrusted with power and command. But James declared himself still

diffident of Raleigh’s intentions; and he meant, he said, to reserve the

former sentence, as a check upon his future behavior.

 

Raleigh well knew that it was far from the king’s purpose to invade any of

the Spanish settlements: he therefore firmly denied that Spain had planted

any colonies on that part of the coast where his mine lay. When Gondomar,

the ambassador of that nation, alarmed at his preparations, carried

complaints to the king, Raleigh still protested the innocence of his

intentions; and James assured Gondomar, that he durst not form any hostile

attempt, but should pay with his head for so audacious an enterprise. The

minister, however, concluding that twelve armed vessels were not fitted

out without some purpose of invasion, conveyed the intelligence to the

court of Madrid, who immediately gave orders for arming and fortifying all

their settlements, particularly those along the coast of Guiana.

 

When the courage and avarice of the Spaniards and Portuguese had

discovered so many new worlds, they were resolved to show themselves

superior to the barbarous heathens whom they invaded, not only in arts and

arms, but also in the justice of the quarrel: they applied to Alexander

VI.., who then filled the papal chair; and he generously bestowed on the

Spaniards the whole western, and on the Portuguese the whole eastern part

of the globe. The more scrupulous Protestants, who acknowledged not the

authority of the Roman pontiff, established the first discovery as the

foundation of their title; and if a pirate or sea adventurer of

their nation had but erected a stick or a stone on the coast, as a

memorial of his taking possession, they concluded the whole continent to

belong to them, and thought themselves entitled to expel or exterminate,

as usurpers, the ancient possessors and inhabitants It was in this manner

that Sir Walter Raleigh, about twenty-three years before, had acquired to

the crown of England a claim to the continent of Guiana, a region as large

as the half of Europe; and though he had immediately left the coast, yet

he pretended that the English title to the whole remained certain and

indefeasible. But it had happened in the mean time, that the Spaniards,

not knowing, or not acknowledging, this imaginary claim, had taken

possession of a part of Guiana, had formed a settlement on the River

Oronooko, had built a little town called St. Thomas, and were there

working some mines of small value.

 

To this place Raleigh directly bent his course; and, remaining himself at

the mouth of the river with five of the largest ships, he sent up the rest

to St. Thomas, under the command of his son, and of Captain Keymis, a

person entirely devoted to him. The Spaniards, who had expected this

invasion, fired on the English at their landing, were repulsed, and

pursued into the town. Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out,

“That this was the true mine, and none but fools looked for any other;”

and, advancing upon the Spaniards, received a shot, of which he

immediately expired. This dismayed not Keymis and the others. They carried

on the attack, got possession of the town, which they afterwards reduced

to ashes; and found not in it any thing of value.

 

Raleigh did not pretend that he had himself seen the mine which he had

engaged so many people to go in quest of: it was Keymis, he said, who had

formerly discovered it, and had brought him that lump of ore, which

promised such immense treasures. Yet Keymis, who owned that he was within

two hours’ march of the place, refused, on the most absurd pretences, to

take any effectual step towards finding it; and he returned immediately to

Raleigh, with the melancholy news of his son’s death, and the ill success

of the enterprise. Sensible to reproach, and dreading punishment for his

behavior, Keymis, in despair, retired into his cabin, and put an end to

his own life.

 

The other adventurers now concluded, that they were deceived by Raleigh;

that he never had known of any such mine as he pretended to go in search

of; that his intention had ever been to plunder St. Thomas; and having

encouraged his company by the spoils of that place, to have thence

proceeded to the invasion of the other Spanish settlements; that he

expected to repair his ruined fortunes by such daring enterprises; and

that he trusted to the money he should acquire, for making his peace with

England; or, if that view failed him, that he purposed to retire into some

other country, where his riches would secure his retreat.

 

The small acquisitions gained by the sack of St. Thomas discouraged

Raleigh’s companions from entering into these views; though there were

many circumstances in the treaty and late transactions between the

nations, which might invite them to engage in such a piratical war against

the Spaniards.

 

When England made peace with Spain, the example of Henry IV. was imitated,

who, at the treaty of Vervins, finding a difficulty in adjusting all

questions with regard to the Indian trade, had agreed to pass over that

article in total silence.

 

The Spaniards, having all along published severe edicts against the this

silence in their own favor, and considered it as a tacit acquiescence of

England in the established laws of Spain. The English, on the contrary,

pretended that, as they had never been excluded by any treaty from

commerce with any part of the king of Spain’s dominions, it was still as

lawful for them to trade with his settlements in either Indies, as with

his European territories. In consequence of this ambiguity, many

adventurers from England sailed to the Spanish Indies, and met with severe

punishment when caught; as they, on the other hand, often stole, and when

superior in power, forced a trade with the inhabitants, and resisted, nay,

sometimes plundered, the Spanish governors. Violences of this nature,

which had been carried to a great height on both sides, it was agreed to

bury in total oblivion; because of the difficulty which was found in

remedying them upon any fixed principles.

 

But as there appeared a great difference between private adventurers in

single ships, and a fleet acting under a royal commission, Raleigh’s

companions thought it safest to return immediately to England, and carry

him along with them to answer for his conduct. It appears that he employed

many artifices, first to engage them to attack the Spanish settlements,

and, failing of that, to make his escape into France: but, all these

proving unsuccessful, he was delivered into the king’s hands, and strictly

examined, as well as his fellow-adventurers, before the privy council. The

council, upon inquiry, found no difficulty in pronouncing, that the former

suspicions, with regard to Raleigh’s intentions, had been well grounded;

that he had abused the king in the representations which he had made of

his projected adventure; that, contrary to his instructions, he had acted

in an offensive and hostile manner against his majesty’s allies; and that

he had wilfully burned and destroyed a town belonging to the king of

Spain. He might have been tried either by common law, for this act of

violence and piracy; or by martial law, for breach of orders: but it was

an established principle among lawyers,[*] that, as he lay under an actual

attainder for high treason, he could not be brought to a new trial for any

other crime. To satisfy, therefore the court of Spain, which raised the

loudest complaints against him, the king made use of that power which he

had purposely reserved in his own hands, and signed the warrant for his

execution upon his former sentence.[**] 54
 

Raleigh, finding his fate inevitable, collected all his courage and though

he had formerly made use of many mean artifices, such as feigning madness,

sickness, and a variety of diseases, in order to protract his examination,

and procure his escape, he now resolved to act his part with bravery and

resolution, “‘Tis a sharp remedy,” he said, “but a sure one for all ills,”

when he felt the edge of the axe by which he was to be beheaded.[*] His

harangue to the people was calm and eloquent; and he endeavored to revenge

himself, and to load his enemies with the public hatred, by strong

asseverations of facts, which, to say the least, may be esteemed very

doubtful.[**] With the utmost indifference he laid his head upon the

block, and received the fatal blow; and in his death there appeared the

same great, but ill-regulated mind, which, during his life, had displayed

itself in all his conduct and behavior.

 

No measure of James’s reign was attended with more public dissatisfaction

than the punishment of Sir Walter Raleigh. To execute a sentence which was

originally so hard, which had been so long suspended, and which seemed to

have been tacitly pardoned, by conferring on him a new trust and

commission, was deemed an instance of cruelty and injustice. To sacrifice

to a concealed enemy of England the life of the only man in the nation who

had a high reputation for valor and military experience, was regarded as

meanness and indiscretion; and the intimate connections which the king was

now entering into with Spain, being universally distasteful, rendered this

proof of his complaisance still more invidious and unpopular.

 

James had entertained an opinion, which was peculiar to himself, and which

had been adopted by none of his predecessors, that any alliance below that

of a great king was unworthy of a prince of Wales; and he never would

allow any princess, but a daughter of France or Spain, to be mentioned as

a match for his son.[*] This instance of pride, which really implies

meanness, as if he could receive honor from any alliance, was so well

known, that Spain had founded on it the hopes of governing, in the most

important transactions, this monarch, so little celebrated for politics or

prudence. During the life of Henry, the king of Spain had dropped some

hints of bestowing on that prince his eldest daughter, whom he afterwards

disposed of in marriage to the young king of France, Lewis XIII. At that

time, the views of the Spaniards were to engage James into a neutrality

with regard to the succession of Cleves, which was disputed between the

Protestant and Popish line;[**] but the bait did not then take; and James,

in consequence of his alliance with the Dutch, and with Henry IV. of

France, marched[***] four thousand men, under the command of Sir Edward

Cecil, who joined these two powers, and put the marquis of Brandenburgh

and the palatine of Newbourg in possession of that duchy.

 

Gondomar was at this time the Spanish ambassador in England; a man whose

flattery was the more artful, because covered with the appearance of

frankness and sincerity; whose politics were the more dangerous, because

disguised under the mask of mirth and pleasantry. He now made offer of the

second daughter of Spain to Prince Charles; and, that he might render the

temptation irresistible to the necessitous monarch, he gave hopes of an

immense fortune, which should attend the princess. The court of Spain,

though determined to contract no alliance with a heretic,[****] entered

into negotiations with James, which they artfully protracted; and, amidst

every disappointment, they still redoubled his hopes of success.[v] The

transactions in Germany, so important to the Austrian greatness, became

every day a new motive for this duplicity of conduct.

 

In that great revolution of manners which happened during the sixteenth

and the seventeenth centuries, the only nations who had the honorable,

though often melancholy advantage, of making an effort for their expiring

privileges, were such as, together with the principles of civil liberty,

were animated with a zeal for religious parties and opinions. Besides the

irresistible force of standing armies, the European princes possessed this

advantage, that they were descended from the ancient royal families; that

they continued the same designations of magistrates, the same appearance

of civil government; and restraining themselves by all the forms of legal

administration, could insensibly impose the yoke on their unguarded

subjects. Even the German nations, who formerly broke the Roman chains,

and restored liberty to mankind, now lost their own liberty, and saw with

grief the absolute authority of their princes firmly established among

them. In their circumstances, nothing but a pious zeal, which disregards

all motives of human prudence, could have made them entertain hopes of

preserving any longer those privileges which their ancestors, through so

many ages, had transmitted to them.

 

As the house of Austria, throughout all her extensive dominions, had ever

made religion the pretence for her usurpations, she now met with

resistance from a like principle; and the Catholic religion, as usual, had

ranged itself on the side of monarchy; the Protestant, on that of liberty.

The states of Bohemia, having taken arms against the emperor Matthias,

continued their revolt against his successor, Ferdinand, and claimed the

observance of all the edicts enacted in favor of the new religion,

together with the restoration of their ancient laws and constitution. The

neighboring principalities, Silesia, Moravia, Lusatia, Austria, even the

kingdom of Hungary, took part in the quarrel; and throughout all these

populous and martial provinces, the spirit of discord and civil war had

universally diffused itself.[*]

 

1619.

 

Ferdinand II., who possessed more vigor and greater abilities, though not

more lenity and moderation, than are usual with the Austrian princes,

strongly armed himself for the recovery of his authority; and besides

employing the assistance of his subjects, who professed the ancient

religion, he engaged on his side a powerful alliance of the neighboring

potentates. All the Catholic princes of the empire had embraced his

defence; even Saxony, the most powerful of the Protestant: Poland had

declared itself in his favor;[**] and, above all, the Spanish monarch,

deeming his own interest closely connected with that of the younger branch

of his family, prepared powerful succors from Italy, and from the Low

Countries; and he also advanced large sums for the support of Ferdinand

and of the Catholic religion.

 

The states of Bohemia, alarmed at these mighty preparations, began also to

solicit foreign assistance; and, together with that support which they

obtained from the evangelical union in Germany, they endeavored to

establish connections with greater princes. They cast their eyes on

Frederic, elector palatine. They considered that, besides commanding no

despicable force of his own, he was son-in-law to the king of England, and

nephew to Prince Maurice, whose authority was become almost absolute in

the United Provinces. They hoped that these princes, moved by the

connections of blood, as well as by the tie of their common religion,

would interest themselves in all the fortunes of Frederic, and would

promote his greatness. They therefore made him a tender of their crown,

which they considered as elective; and the young palatine, stimulated by

ambition, without consulting either James[*] or Maurice, whose opposition

he foresaw, immediately accepted the offer, and marched all his forces

into Bohemia, in support of his new subjects.

 

The news of these events no sooner reached England, than the whole kingdom

was on fire to engage in the quarrel. Scarcely was the ardor greater, with

which all the states of Europe, in former ages, flew to rescue the Holy

Land from the dominion of infidels. The nation was as yet sincerely

attached to the blood of their monarchs, and they considered their

connection with the palatine, who had married a daughter of England, as

very close and intimate; and when they heard of Catholics carrying on wars

and persecutions against Protestants, they thought their own interest

deeply concerned, and regarded their neutrality as a base desertion of the

cause of God, and of his holy religion. In such a quarrel they would

gladly have marched to the opposite extremity of Europe, have plunged

themselves into a chaos of German politics, and have expended all the

blood and treasure of the nation, by maintaining a contest with the whole

house of Austria, at the very time and in the very place in which it was

the most potent, and almost irresistible.

 

But James, besides that his temper was too little enterprising for such

vast undertakings, was restrained by another motive, which had a mighty

influence over him: he refused to patronize the revolt of subjects against

their sovereign. From the very first, he denied to his son-in-law the

title of king of Bohemia.[**]

 

He forbade him to be prayed for in the churches under that appellation;

and though he owned, that he had nowise examined the pretensions,

privileges, and constitution of the revolted states,[*] so exalted was his

idea of the rights of kings, that he concluded subjects must ever be in

the wrong, when they stood in opposition to those who had acquired or

assumed that majestic title. Thus, even in measures founded on true

politics, James intermixed so many narrow prejudices, as diminished his

authority, and exposed him to the imputation of weakness and of error.

 

1620.

 

Meanwhile affairs every where hastened to a crisis. Ferdinand levied a

great force, under the command of the duke of Bavaria and the count of

Bucquoy, and advanced upon his enemy in Bohemia. In the Low Countries,

Spinola collected a veteran army of thirty thousand men. When Edmonds, the

king’s resident at Brussels, made remonstrances to the archduke Albert, he

was answered, that the orders for this armament had been transmitted to

Spinola from Madrid, and that he alone knew the secret destination of it.

Spinola again told the minister that his orders were still sealed; but, if

Edmonds would accompany him in his march to Coblentz, he would there open

them, and give him full satisfaction.[**] It was more easy to see his

intentions, than to prevent their success. Almost at one time it was known

in England, that Frederic, being defeated in the great and decisive battle

of Prague, had fled with his family into Holland, and that Spinola had

invaded the Palatinate, and, meeting with no resistance, except from some

princes of the union, and from one English regiment of two thousand four

hundred men, commanded by the brave Sir Horace Vere,[***] had, in a little

time, reduced the greater part of that principality.

 

High were now the murmurs and complaints against the king’s neutrality and

inactive disposition. The happiness and tranquillity of their own country

became distasteful to the English, when they reflected on the grievances

and distresses of their Protestant brethren in Germany. They considered

not, that their interposition in the wars of the continent, though

agreeable to religious zeal, could not, at that time, be justified by any

sound maxims of politics; that, however exorbitant the Austrian greatness,

the danger was still too distant to give any just alarm to England; that

mighty resistance would yet be made by so many potent and warlike princes

and states in Germany, ere they would yield their neck to the yoke; that

France, now engaged to contract a double alliance with the Austrian

family, must necessarily be soon roused from her lethargy, and oppose the

progress of so hated a rival; that, in the further advance of conquests,

even the interests of the two branches of that ambitious family must

interfere, and beget mutual jealousy and opposition; that a land war,

carried on at such a distance, would waste the blood and treasure of the

English nation, without any hopes of success; that a sea war, indeed,

might be both safe and successful against Spain, but would not affect the

enemy in such vital parts as to make them stop their career of success in

Germany, and abandon all their acquisitions; and that the prospect of

recovering the Palatinate being at present desperate, the affair was

reduced to this simple question, whether peace and commerce with Spain, or

the uncertain hopes of plunder and of conquest in the Indies, were

preferable? a question which, at the beginning of the king’s reign, had

already been decided, and perhaps with reason, in favor of the former

advantages.

 

James might have defended his pacific measures by such plausible

arguments; but these, though the chief, seem not to have been the sole

motives which swayed him. He had entertained the notion, that, as his own

justice and moderation had shone out so conspicuously throughout all these

transactions, the whole house of Austria, though not awed by the power of

England, would willingly, from mere respect to his virtue, submit

themselves to so equitable an arbitration. He flattered himself that,

after he had formed an intimate connection with the Spanish monarch, by

means of his son’s marriage, the restitution of the Palatinate might be

procured from the motive alone of friendship and personal attachment. He

perceived not, that his unactive virtue, the more it was extolled, the

greater disregard was it exposed to. He was not sensible, that the Spanish

match was itself attended with such difficulties, that all his art of

negotiation would scarcely be able to surmount them; much less, that this

match could in good policy be depended on, as the means of procuring such

extraordinary advantages. His unwarlike disposition, increased by age,

rivetted him still faster in his errors, and determined him to seek the

restoration of his son-in-law, by remonstrances and entreaties, by

arguments and embassies, rather than by blood and violence. And the same

defect of courage which held him in awe of foreign nations, made him

likewise afraid of shocking the prejudices of his own subjects, and kept

him from openly avowing the measures which he was determined to pursue.

Or, perhaps, he hoped to turn these prejudices to account; and, by their

means, engage his people to furnish him with supplies, of which their

excessive frugality had hitherto made them so sparing and reserved.[*]

 

He first tried the expedient of a benevolence, or free gift, from

individuals; pretending the urgency of the case, which would not admit of

leisure for any other measure: but the jealousy of liberty was now roused,

and the nation regarded these pretended benevolences as real extortions,

contrary to law, and dangerous to freedom, however authorized by ancient

precedent. A parliament was found to be the only resource which could

furnish any large supplies; and writs were accordingly issued for

summoning that great council of the nation.[**] 55
 

1621.

 

In this parliament there appeared, at first, nothing but duty and

submission on the part of the commons; and they seemed determined to

sacrifice every thing, in order to maintain a good correspondence with

their prince. They would allow no mention to be made of the new customs or

impositions, which had been so eagerly disputed in the former

parliament;[***] the imprisonment of the members of that parliament was

here by some complained of; but, by the authority of the graver and more

prudent part of the house, that grievance was buried in oblivion;[****]

and, being informed that the king had remitted several considerable sums

to the palatine, the commons, without a negative, voted him two

subsidies;[v] and that too at the very beginning of the session, contrary

to the maxims frequently adopted by their predecessors.

 

Afterwards they proceeded, but in a very temperate manner, to the

examination of grievances. They found, that patents had been granted to

Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michel, for licensing inns and

alehouses; that great sums of money had been exacted, under pretext of

these licenses; and that such innkeepers as presumed to continue their

business without satisfying the rapacity of the patentees, had been

severely punished by fine, imprisonment, and vexatious prosecutions.

 

The same persons had also procured a patent, which they shared with Sir

Edward Villiers, brother to Buckingham, for the sole making of gold and

silver thread and lace, and had obtained very extraordinary powers for

preventing any rivalship in these manufactures: they were armed with

authority to search for all goods which might interfere with their patent;

and even to punish, at their own will and discretion, the makers,

importers, and venders of such commodities. Many had grievously suffered

by this exorbitant jurisdiction; and the lace which had been manufactured

by the patentees was universally found to be adulterated, and to be

composed more of copper than of the precious metals.

 

These grievances the commons represented to the king and they met with a

very gracious and very cordial reception. He seemed even thankful for the

information given him; and declared himself ashamed that such abuses,

unknowingly to him, had crept into his administration. “I assure you,”

said he, “had I before heard these things complained of, I would have done

the office of a just king, and out of parliament have punished them, as

severely, and peradventure more, than you now intend to do.”[*] A sentence

was passed for the punishment of Michel and Mompesson.[**] It was executed

on the former. The latter broke prison and escaped. Villiers was at that

time sent purposely on a foreign employment; and his guilt, being less

enormous, or less apparent, than that of the others, he was the more

easily protected by the credit of his brother Buckingham.[***]

 

Encouraged by this success, the commons carried their scrutiny, and still

with a respectful hand, into other abuses of importance. The great seal

was at that time in the hands of the celebrated Bacon, created Viscount

St. Albans; a man universally admired for the greatness of his genius, and

beloved for the courteousness and humanity of his behavior. He was the

great ornament of his age and nation; and nought was wanting to render him

the ornament of human nature itself, but that strength of mind which might

check his intemperate desire of preferment, that could add nothing to his

dignity, and might restrain his profuse inclination to expense, that could

be requisite neither for his honor nor entertainment. His want of economy,

and his indulgence to servants, had involved him in necessities; and, in

order to supply his prodigality, he had been tempted to take bribes, by

the title of presents, and that in a very open manner, from suitors in

chancery. It appears that it had been usual for former chancellors to take

presents; and it is pretended that Bacon, who followed the same dangerous

practice, had still, in the seat of justice, preserved the integrity of a

judge, and had given just decrees against those very persons from whom he

had received the wages of iniquity. Complaints rose the louder on that

account, and at last reached the house of commons, who sent up an

impeachment against him to the peers. The chancellor, conscious of guilt,

deprecated the vengeance of his judges, and endeavored, by a general

avowal, to escape the confusion of a stricter inquiry. The lords insisted

on a particular confession of all his corruptions. He acknowledged

twenty-eight articles; and was sentenced to pay a fine of forty thousand

pounds, to be imprisoned in the Tower during the king’s pleasure, to be

forever incapable of any office, place, or employment, and never again to

sit in parliament, or come within the verge of the court.

 

This dreadful sentence, dreadful to a man of nice sensibility to honor, he

survived five years; and being released in a little time from the Tower,

his genius, yet unbroken, supported itself amidst involved circumstances

and a depressed spirit, and shone out in literary productions which have

made his guilt or weaknesses be forgotten or overlooked by posterity. In

consideration of his great merit, the king remitted his fine, as well as

all the other parts of his sentence, conferred on him a large pension of

one thousand eight hundred pounds a year, and employed every expedient to

alleviate the weight of his age and misfortunes. And that great

philosopher at last acknowledged with regret, that he had too long

neglected the true ambition of a fine genius; and by plunging into

business and affairs, which require much less capacity, but greater

firmness of mind, than the pursuits of learning, had exposed himself to

such grievous calamities.[*]

 

The commons had entertained the idea, that they were the great patrons of

the people, and that the redress of all grievances must proceed from them;

and to this principle they were chiefly beholden for the regard and

consideration of the public. In the execution of this office, they now

kept their ears open to complaints of every kind; and they carried their

researches into many grievances which, though of no great importance,

could not be touched on without sensibly affecting the king and his

ministers. The prerogative seemed every moment to be invaded; the king’s

authority, in every article, was disputed; and James, who was willing to

correct the abuses of his power, would not submit to have his power itself

questioned and denied. After the house, therefore, had sitten near six

months, and had as yet brought no considerable business to a full

conclusion, the king resolved, under pretence of the advanced season, to

interrupt their proceedings; and he sent them word, that he was

determined, in a little time, to adjourn them till next winter. The

commons made application to the lords, and desired them to join in a

petition for delaying the adjournment; which was refused by the upper

house. The king regarded this project of a joint petition as an attempt to

force him from his measures: he thanked the peers for their refusal to

concur in it; and told them, that, if it were their desire, he would delay

the adjournment, but would not so far comply with the request of the lower

house.[**] And thus, in these great national affairs, the same

peevishness, which, in private altercations, often raises a quarrel from

the smallest beginnings, produced a mutual coldness and disgust between

the king and the commons.

 

During the recess of parliament, the king used every measure to render

himself popular with the nation, and to appease the rising ill humor of

their representatives. He had voluntarily offered the parliament to

circumscribe his own prerogative, and to abrogate, for the future, his

power of granting monopolies. He now recalled all the patents of that kind

and redressed every article of grievance, to the number of thirty-seven,

which had ever been complained of in the house of commons.[*] But he

gained not the end which he proposed. The disgust which had appeared at

parting, could not so suddenly be dispelled. He had likewise been so

imprudent as to commit to prison Sir Edwin Sandys,[**] without any known

cause, besides his activity and vigor in discharging his duty as member of

parliament. And, above all, the transactions in Germany were sufficient,

when joined to the king’s cautions, negotiations, and delays, to inflame

that jealousy of honor and religion which prevailed throughout the

nation.[***] This summer, the ban of the empire had been published against

the elector palatine; and the execution of it was committed to the duke of

Bavaria.[****] The Upper Palatinate was, in a little time, conquered by

that prince; and measures were taking in the empire for bestowing on him

the electoral dignity, of which the palatine was then despoiled. Frederic

now lived with his numerous family, in poverty and distress, either in

Holland, or at Sedan with his uncle the duke of Bouillon. And throughout

all the new conquests, in both the Palatinates, as well as in Bohemia,

Austria, and Lusatia, the progress of the Austrian arms was attended with

rigors and severities, exercised against the professors of the reformed

religion.

 

The zeal of the commons immediately moved them, upon their assembling, to

take all these transactions into consideration. They framed a

remonstrance, which they intended to carry to the king. They represented,

that the enormous growth of the Austrian power threatened the liberties of

Europe; that the progress of the Catholic religion in England bred the

most melancholy apprehensions, lest it should again acquire an ascendant

in the kingdom; that the indulgence of his majesty towards the professors

of that religion had encouraged their insolence and temerity; that the

uncontrolled conquests made by the Austrian family in Germany, raised

mighty expectations in the English Papists; but above all, that the

prospect of the Spanish match elevated them so far as to hope for an

entire toleration, if not the final reÃ«stablishment of their religion. The

commons, therefore, entreated his majesty, that he would immediately

undertake the defence of the Palatinate, and maintain it by force of arms;

that he would turn his sword against Spain, whose armies and treasures

were the chief support of the Catholic interest in Europe that he would

enter into no negotiation for the marriage of his son but with a

Protestant princess; that the children of Popish recusants should be taken

from their parents, and be committed to the care of Protestant teachers

and schoolmasters; and that the fines and confiscations to which the

Catholics were by law liable, should be levied with the utmost

severity.[*]

 

By this bold step, unprecedented in England for many years, and scarcely

ever heard of in peaceable times, the commons attacked at once all the

king’s favorite maxims of government; his cautious and pacific measures,

his lenity towards the Romish religion, and his attachment to the Spanish

alliance, from which he promised himself such mighty advantages. But what

most disgusted him was, their seeming invasion of his prerogative, and

their pretending, under color of advice, to direct his conduct in such

points as had ever been acknowledged to belong solely to the management

and direction of the sovereign. He was at that time absent at Newmarket;

but as soon as he heard of the intended remonstrance of the commons, he

wrote a letter to the speaker, in which he sharply rebuked the house for

openly debating matters far above their reach and capacity; and he

strictly forbade them to meddle with any thing that regarded his

government, or deep matters of state, and especially not to touch on his

son’s marriage with the daughter of Spain, nor to attack the honor of that

king, or any other of his friends and confederates. In order the more to

intimidate them, he mentioned the imprisonment of Sir Edwin Sandys; and

though he denied that the confinement of that member had been owing to any

offence committed in the house, he plainly told them, that he thought

himself fully entitled to punish every misdemeanor in parliament, as well

during its sitting as after its dissolution; and that he intended

thenceforward to chastise any man whose insolent behavior there should

minister occasion of offence.[*]

 

This violent letter, in which the king, though he here imitated former

precedents, may be thought not to have acted altogether on the defensive,

had the effect which might naturally have been expected from it: the

commons were inflamed, not terrified. Secure of their own popularity, and

of the bent of the nation towards a war with the Catholics abroad, and the

persecution of Popery at home, they little dreaded the menaces of a prince

who was unsupported by military force, and whose gentle temper would, of

itself, so soon disarm his severity. In a new remonstrance, therefore,

they still insisted on their former remonstrance and advice; and they

maintained, though in respectful terms, that they were entitled to

interpose with their counsel in all matters of government; that to possess

entire freedom of speech in their debates on public business, was their

ancient and undoubted right, and an inheritance transmitted to them from

their ancestors; and that if any member abused this liberty, it belonged

to the house alone, who were witnesses of his offence, to inflict a proper

censure upon him.[**]

 

So vigorous an answer was nowise calculated to appease the king. It is

said, when the approach of the committee who were to present it was

notified to him, he ordered twelve chairs to be brought; for that there

were so many kings a coming.[***]

 

His answer was prompt and sharp. He told the house, that their

remonstrance was more like a denunciation of war than an address of

dutiful subjects; that their pretension to inquire into all state affairs,

without exception, was such a plenipotence as none of their ancestors,

even during the reign of the weakest princes, had ever pretended to; that

public transactions depended on a complication of views and intelligence,

with which they were entirely unacquainted; that they could not better

show their wisdom, as well as duty, than by keeping within their proper

sphere;[*] and that in any business which depended on his prerogative,

they had no title to interpose with their advice, except when he was

pleased to desire it. And he concluded with these memorable words: “And

though we cannot allow of your style, in mentioning your ancient and

undoubted right and inheritance, but would rather have wished that ye had

said, that your privileges were derived from the grace and permission of

our ancestors and us, (for the most of them grew from precedents, which

shows rather a toleration than inheritance,) yet we are pleased to give

you our royal assurance, that as long as you contain yourselves within the

limits of your duty, we will be as careful to maintain and preserve your

lawful liberties and privileges as ever any of our predecessors were, nay,

as to preserve our own royal prerogative.”[**]

 

This open pretension of the king’s naturally gave great alarm to the house

of commons. They saw their title to every privilege, if not plainly

denied, yet considered at least as precarious. It might be fortified by

abuse; and they had already abused it. They thought proper, therefore,

immediately to oppose pretension to pretension. They framed a

protestation, in which they repeated all their former claims for freedom

of speech, and an unbounded authority to interpose with their advice and

counsel. And they asserted, “That the liberties, franchises, privileges,

and jurisdictions of parliament, are the ancient and undoubted birthright

and inheritance of the subjects of England.”[***]

 

The king, informed of these increasing heats and jealousies in the house,

hurried to town. He sent immediately for the journals of the commons; and,

with his own hand, before the council, he tore out this

protestation;[****] 56 and ordered his reasons to be inserted in the

council-book. He was doubly displeased, he said, with the protestation of

the lower house, on account of the manner of framing it, as well as of the

matter which it contained.

 

It was tumultuously voted, at a late hour, and in a thin house; and it was

expressed in such general and ambiguous terms,[*] as might serve for a

foundation to the most enormous claims, and to the most unwarrantable

usurpations upon his prerogative.[**]

 

The meeting of the house might have proved dangerous after so violent a

breach. It was no longer possible, while men were in such a temper, to

finish any business. The king, therefore, prorogued the parliament, and

soon after dissolved it by proclamation; in which he also made an apology

to the public for his whole conduct.

 

The leading members of the house, Sir Edward Coke and Sir Robert Philips,

were committed to the Tower; Selden Pym, and Mallory, to other prisons. As

a lighter punishment, Sir Dudley Digges, Sir Thomas Crew, Sir Nathaniel

Rich, Sir James Perrot, joined in commission with others, were sent to

Ireland, in order to execute some business.[***] The king at that time

enjoyed, at least exercised, the prerogative of employing any man, even

without his consent, in any branch of public service.

 

Sir John Savile, a powerful man in the house of commons, and a zealous

opponent of the court, was made comptroller of the household, a privy

counsellor, and soon after a baron.[****] This event is memorable, as

being the first instance, perhaps, in the whole history of England, of any

king’s advancing a man on account of parliamentary interest, and of

opposition to his measures. However irregular this practice, it will be

regarded by political reasoners as one of the most early and most

infallible symptoms of a regular, established liberty.

 

The king having thus, with so rash and indiscreet a hand, torn off that

sacred veil which had hitherto covered the English constitution, and which

threw an obscurity upon it so advantageous to royal prerogative, every man

began to indulge himself in political reasonings and inquiries; and the

same factions which commenced in parliament, were propagated throughout

the nation. In vain did James, by reiterated proclamations, forbid the

discoursing of state affairs.[v] Such proclamations, if they had any

effect, served rather to inflame the curiosity of the public. And in every

company or society, the late transactions became the subject of argument

and debate.

 

All history, said the partisans of the court, as well as the history of

England, justify the king’s position with regard to the origin of popular

privileges; and every reasonable man must allow, that as monarchy is the

most simple form of government, it must first have occurred to rude and

uninstructed mankind. The other complicated and artificial additions were

the successive invention of sovereigns and legislators; or, if they were

obtruded on the prince by seditious subjects, their origin must appear, on

that very account, still more precarious and unfavorable. In England, the

authority of the king, in all the exterior forms of government, and in the

common style of law, appears totally absolute and sovereign; nor does the

real spirit of the constitution, as it has ever discovered itself in

practice, fall much short of these appearances. The parliament is created

by his will; by his will it is dissolved. It is his will alone, though at

the desire of both houses, which gives authority to laws. To all foreign

nations, the majesty of the monarch seems to merit sole attention and

regard. And no subject who has exposed himself to royal indignation, can

hope to live with safety in the kingdom; nor can he even leave it,

according to law, without the consent of his master. If a magistrate,

environed with such power and splendor, should consider his authority as

sacred, and regard himself as the anointed of Heaven, his pretensions may

bear a very favorable construction. Or, allowing them to be merely pious

frauds, we need not be surprised, that the same stratagem which was

practised by Minos, Numa, and the most celebrated legislators of

antiquity, should now, in these restless and inquisitive times, be

employed by the king of England. Subjects are not raised above that

quality, though assembled in parliament. The same humble respect and

deference is still due to their prince. Though he indulges them in the

privilege of laying before him their domestic grievances, with which they

are supposed to be best acquainted, this warrants not their bold intrusion

into every province of government. And, to all judicious examiners, it

must appear, “That the lines of duty are as much transgressed by a more

independent and less respectful exercise of acknowledged powers, as by the

usurpation of such as are new and unusual.”[*]

 

The lovers of liberty throughout the nation reasoned after a different

manner. It is in vain, said they, that the king traces up the English

government to its first origin, in order to represent the privileges of

parliament as dependent and precarious: prescription, and the practice of

so many ages, must, long ere this time, have given a sanction to these

assemblies, even though they had been derived from an origin no more

dignified than that which he assigns them. If the written records of the

English nation, as asserted, represent parliaments to have arisen from the

consent of monarchs, the principles of human nature, when we trace

government a step higher, must show us, that monarchs themselves owe all

their authority to the voluntary submission of the people. But, in fact,

no age can be shown, when the English government was altogether an unmixed

monarchy; and, if the privileges of the nation have, at any period, been

overpowered by violent irruptions of foreign force or domestic usurpation,

the generous spirit of the people has ever seized the first opportunity of

reÃ«stablishing the ancient government and constitution. Though in the

style of the laws, and in the usual forms of administration, royal

authority may be represented as sacred and supreme, whatever is essential

to the exercise of sovereign and legislative power must still be regarded

as equally divine and inviolable. Or, if any distinction be made in this

respect, the preference is surely due to those national councils, by whose

interposition the exorbitancies of tyrannical power are restrained, and

that sacred liberty is preserved, which heroic spirits, in all ages, have

deemed more precious than life itself. Nor is it sufficient to say, that

the mild and equitable administration of James affords little occasion, or

no occasion, of complaint. How moderate soever the exercise of his

prerogative, how exact soever his observance of the laws and constitution,

“If he founds his authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is

requisite to watch him with the same care, and to oppose him with the same

vigor, as if he had indulged himself in all the excesses of cruelty and

tyranny.”

 

Amidst these disputes, the wise and moderate in the nation endeavored to

preserve, as much as possible, an equitable neutrality between the

opposite parties; and the more they reflected on the course of public

affairs, the greater difficulty they found in fixing just sentiments with

regard to them. On the one hand, they regarded the very rise of parties as

a happy prognostic of the establishment of liberty; nor could they ever

expect to enjoy, in a mixed government, so invaluable a blessing, without

suffering that inconvenience which, in such governments, has ever attended

it. But when they considered, on the other hand, the necessary aims and

pursuits of both parties, they were struck with apprehension of the

consequences, and could discover no feasible plan of accommodation between

them. From long practice, the crown was now possessed of so exorbitant a

prerogative, that it was not sufficient for liberty to remain on the

defensive, or endeavor to secure the little ground which was left her: it

was become necessary to carry on an offensive war, and to circumscribe,

within more narrow, as well as more exact bounds; the authority of the

sovereign. Upon such provocation, it could not but happen, that the

prince, however just and moderate, would endeavor to repress his

opponents; and, as he stood upon the very brink of arbitrary power, it was

to be feared that he would, hastily and unknowingly, pass those limits

which were not precisely marked by the constitution. The turbulent

government of England, ever fluctuating between privilege and prerogative,

would afford a variety of precedents, which might be pleaded on both

sides. In such delicate questions, the people must be divided: the arms of

the state were still in their hands: a civil war must ensue; a civil war

where no party, or both parties, would justly bear the blame and where the

good and virtuous would scarcely know what vows to form; were it not that

liberty, so necessary to the perfection of human society, would be

sufficient to bias their affections towards the side of its defenders.
