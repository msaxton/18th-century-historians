The extensive confederacies, by which the European potentates are now at

      once united and set in opposition to each other, and which, though they

      are apt to diffuse the least spark of dissension throughout the whole, are

      at least attended with this advantage, that they prevent any violent

      revolutions or conquests in particular states, were totally unknown in

      ancient ages; and the theory of foreign politics in each kingdom formed a

      speculation much less complicated and involved than at present. Commerce

      had not yet bound together the most distant nations in so close a chain:

      wars, finished in one campaign, and often in one battle, were little

      affected by the movements of remote states: the imperfect communication

      among the kingdoms, and their ignorance of each other’s situation, made it

      impracticable for a great number of them to combine in one object or

      effort: and above all, the turbulent spirit and independent situation of

      the barons or great vassals in each state, gave so much occupation to the

      sovereign, that he was obliged to confine his attention chiefly to his own

      state and his own system of government, and was more indifferent about

      what passed among his neighbors. Religion alone, not politics, carried

      abroad the views of princes, while it either fixed their thoughts on the

      Holy Land, whose conquest and defence was deemed a point of common honor

      and interest, or engaged them in intrigues with the Roman pontiff, to whom

      they had yielded the direction of ecclesiastical affairs, and who was

      every day assuming more authority than they were willing to allow him.

     

      Before the conquest of England by the duke of Normandy, this island was as

      much separated from the rest of the world in politics as in situation; and

      except from the inroads of the Danish pirates, the English, happily

      confined at home, had neither enemies nor allies on the continent. The

      foreign dominions of William connected them with the king and great

      vassals of France; and while the opposite pretensions of the pope and

      emperor in Italy produced a continual intercourse between Germany and that

      country, the two great monarchs of France and England formed, in another

      part of Europe, a separate system, and carried on their wars and

      negotiations, without meeting either with opposition or support from the

      others.

     

      On the decline of the Carlovingian race, the nobles in every province of

      France, taking advantage of the weakness of the sovereign, and obliged to

      provide each for his own defence against the ravages of the Norman

      freebooters, had assumed, both in civil and military affairs, an authority

      almost independent, and had reduced within very narrow limits the

      prerogative of their princes. The accession of Hugh Capet, by annexing a

      great fief to the crown, had brought some addition to the royal dignity;

      but this fief, though considerable for a subject, appeared a narrow basis

      of power for a prince who was placed at the head of so great a community.

      The royal demesnes consisted only of Paris, Orleans, Estampes, Compiegne,

      and a few places scattered over the northern provinces: in the rest of the

      kingdom, the prince’s authority was rather nominal than real: the vassals

      were accustomed, nay, entitled, to make war, without his permission, on

      each other: they were even entitled, if they conceived themselves injured,

      to turn their arms against their sovereign: they exercised all civil

      jurisdiction, without appeal, over their tenants and inferior vassals:

      their common jealousy of the crown easily united them against any attempt

      on their exorbitant privileges; and as some of them had attained the power

      and authority of great princes, even the smallest baron was sure of

      immediate and effectual protection. Besides six ecclesiastical peerages,

      which, with the other immunities of the church, cramped extremely the

      general execution of justice, there were six lay peerages, Burgundy,

      Normandy Guienne, Flanders, Toulouse, and Champagne, which formed very

      extensive and puissant sovereignties. And though the combination of all

      those princes and barons could on urgent occasions, muster a mighty power,

      yet was it very difficult to set that great machine in movement; it was

      almost impossible to preserve harmony in its parts; a sense of common

      interest alone could, for a time, unite them under their sovereign against

      a common enemy; but if the king attempted to turn the force of the

      community against any mutinous vassal, the same sense of common interest

      made the others oppose themselves to the success of his pretensions. Lewis

      the Gross, the last sovereign, marched, at one time, to his frontiers

      against the Germans at the head of an army of two hundred thousand men;

      but a petty lord of Corbeil, of Puiset, of Couci, was able, at another

      period, to set that prince at defiance, and to maintain open war against

      him.

     

      The authority of the English monarch was much more extensive within his

      kingdom, and the disproportion much greater between him and the most

      powerful of his vassals. His demesnes and revenue were large, compared to

      the greatness of his state: he was accustomed to levy arbitrary exactions

      on his subjects: his courts of judicature extended their jurisdiction into

      every part of the kingdom: he could crush by his power, or by a judicial

      sentence, well or ill founded, any obnoxious baron: and though the feudal

      institutions, which prevailed in his kingdom, had the same tendency, as in

      other states, to exalt the aristocracy and depress the monarchy, it

      required in England, according to its present constitution, a great

      combination of the vassals to oppose their sovereign lord, and there had

      not hitherto arisen any baron so powerful, as of himself to levy war

      against the prince, and to afford protection to the inferior barons.

     

      While such were the different situations of France and England, and the

      latter enjoyed so many advantages above the former, the accession of Henry

      II., a prince of great abilities, possessed of so many rich provinces on

      the continent, might appear an event dangerous, if not fatal to the French

      monarchy, and sufficient to break entirely the balance between the states.

      He was master, in the right of his father, of Anjou and Touraine; in that

      of his mother, of Normandy and Maine; in that of his wife, of Guienne,

      Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Perigord, Angoumois, the Limousin. He soon

      after annexed Brittany to his other states, and was already possessed of

      the superiority over that province, which, on the first cession of

      Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had been granted by Charles the Simple in

      vassalage to that formidable ravager. These provinces composed above a

      third of the whole French monarchy, and were much superior, in extent and

      opulence, to those territories which were subjected to the immediate

      jurisdiction and government of the king. The vassal was here more powerful

      than his liege lord: the situation which had enabled Hugh Capet to depose

      the Carlovingian princes, seemed to be renewed, and that with much greater

      advantages on the side of the vassal: and when England was added to so

      many provinces, the French king had reason to apprehend, from this

      conjuncture, some great disaster to himself and to his family. But, in

      reality, it was this circumstance, which appeared so formidable, that

      saved the Capetian race, and, by its consequences, exalted them to that

      pitch of grandeur which they at present enjoy.

     

      The limited authority of the prince in the feudal constitutions, prevented

      the king of England from employing with advantage the force of so many

      states which were subjected to his government; and these different

      members, disjoined in situation, and disagreeing in laws, language, and

      manners, were never thoroughly cemented into one monarchy. He soon became,

      both from his distant place of residence and from the incompatibility of

      interests, a kind of foreigner to his French dominions; and his subjects

      on the continent considered their allegiance as more naturally due to

      their superior lord, who lived in their neighborhood, and who was

      acknowledged to be the supreme head of their nation. He was always at hand

      to invade them; their immediate lord was often at too great a distance to

      protect them; and any disorder in any part of his dispersed dominions gave

      advantages against him The other powerful vassals of the French crown were

      rather pleased to see the expulsion of the English, and were not affected

      with that jealousy which would have arisen from the oppression of a

      co-vassal who was of the same rank with themselves. By this means, the

      king of France found it more easy to conquer those numerous provinces from

      England than to subdue a duke of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou,

      Maine, or Poietou. And after reducing such extensive territories, which

      immediately incorporated with the body of the monarchy, he found greater

      facility in uniting to the crown the other great fiefs which still

      remained separate and independent.

     

      But as these important consequences could not be foreseen by human wisdom,

      the king of France remarked with terror the rising grandeur of the house

      of Anjou or Plantagenet; and in order to retard its progress, he had ever

      maintained a strict union with Stephen, and had endeavored to support the

      tottering fortunes of that bold usurper. But after this prince’s death, it

      was too late to think of opposing the succession of Henry, or preventing

      the performance of those stipulations which, with the unanimous consent of

      the nation, he had made with his predecessor. The English, harassed with

      civil wars, and disgusted with the bloodshed and depredations which,

      during the course of so many years, had attended them were little disposed

      to violate their oaths, by excluding the lawful heir from the succession

      of their monarchy.* Many of the most considerable fortresses were in the

      hands of his partisans; the whole nation had had occasion to see the noble

      qualities with which he was endowed, and to compare them with the mean

      talents of William, the son of Stephen; and as they were acquainted with

      his great power, and were rather pleased to see the accession of so many

      foreign dominions to the crown of England, they never entertained the

      least thoughts of resisting him. Henry himself, sensible of the advantages

      attending his present situation, was in no hurry to arrive in England; and

      being engaged in the siege of a castle on the frontiers of Normandy, when

      he received intelligence of Stephen’s death, he made it a point of honor

      not to depart from his enterprise till he had brought it to an issue. He

      then set out on his journey, and was received in England with the

      acclamations of all orders of men, who swore with pleasure the oath of

      fealty and allegiance to him.

     

      1155.

     

      The first act of Henry’s government corresponded to the high idea

      entertained of his abilities, and prognosticated the reestablishment of

      justice and tranquillity, of which the kingdom had so long been bereaved.

      He immediately dismissed all those mercenary soldiers who had committed

      great disorders in the nation; and he sent them abroad, together with

      William of Ypres, their leader, the friend and confidant of Stephen. He

      revoked all the grants made by his predecessor, even those which necessity

      had extorted from the empress Matilda; and that princess, who had resigned

      her rights in favor of Henry, made no opposition to a measure so necessary

      for supporting the dignity of the crown. He repaired the coin, which had

      been extremely debased during the reign of his predecessor; and he took

      proper measures against the return of a like abuse. He was rigorous in the

      execution of justice, and in the suppression of robbery and violence; and

      that he might restore authority to the laws, he caused all the new erected

      castles to be demolished, which had proved so many sanctuaries to

      freebooters and rebels. The earl of Albemarle, Hugh Mortimer, and Roger

      the son of Milo of Glocester, were inclined to make some resistance to

      this salutary measure; but the approach of the king with his forces soon

      obliged them to submit.

     

      1156.

     

      Everything being restored to full tranquillity in England, Henry went

      abroad in order to oppose the attempts of his brother Geoffrey, who,

      during his absence, had made an incursion into Anjou and Maine,

     

      1157.

     

      had advanced some pretensions to those provinces, and had got possession

      of a considerable part of them. On the king’s appearance, the people

      returned to their allegiance; and Geoffrey, resigning his claim for an

      annual pension of a thousand pounds, departed and took possession of the

      county of Nantz, which the inhabitants, who had expelled Count Iloel,

      their prince, had put into his hands. Henry returned to England the

      following year: the incursions of the Welsh then provoked him to make an

      invasion upon them; where the natural fastnesses of the country occasioned

      him great difficulties, and even brought him into danger. His vanguard,

      being engaged in a narrow pass, was put to rout: Henry de Essex, the

      hereditary standard-bearer, seized with a panic, threw down the standard,

      took to flight, and exclaimed that the king was slain; and had not the

      prince immediately appeared in person, and led on his troops with great

      gallantry, the consequences might have proved fatal to the whole army. For

      this misbehavior, Essex was afterwards accused of felony by Robert de

      Montfort; was vanquished in single combat; his estate was confiscated; and

      he himself was thrust into a convent. The submissions of the Welsh

      procured them an accommodation with England.

     

      1158.

     

      The martial disposition of the princes in that age engaged them to head

      their own armies in every enterprise, even the most frivolous; and their

      feeble authority made it commonly impracticable for them to delegate, on

      occasion, the command to their generals. Geoffrey, the king’s brother,

      died soon after he had acquired possession of Nantz; though he had no

      other title to that county than the voluntary submission or election of

      the inhabitants two years before, Henry laid claim to the territory as

      devolved to him by hereditary right, and he went over to support his

      pretensions by force of arms. Conan, duke or earl of Brittany (for these

      titles are given indifferently by historians to those princes) pretended

      that Nantz had been lately separated by rebellion from his principality,

      to which of right it belonged; and immediately on Geoffrey’s death, he

      took possession of the disputed territory. Lest Lewis, the French king,

      should interpose in the controversy, Henry paid him a visit; and so

      allured him by caresses and civilities, that an alliance was contracted

      between them; and they agreed that young Henry, heir to the English

      monarchy, should be affianced to Margaret of France, though the former was

      only five years of age; the latter was still in her cradle. Henry, now

      secure of meeting with no interruption on this side, advanced with his

      army into Brittany; and Conan, in despair of being able to make

      resistance, delivered up the county of Nantz to him. The able conduct of

      the king procured him further and more important advantages from this

      incident. Conan, harassed with the turbulent disposition of his subjects,

      was desirous of procuring to himself the support of so great a monarch;

      and he betrothed his daughter and only child, yet an infant, to Geoffrey,

      the king’s third son, who was of the same tender years. The duke of

      Brittany died about seven years after; and Henry, being mesne lord and

      also natural guardian to his son and daughter-in-law, put himself in

      possession of that principality, and annexed it for the present to his

      other great dominions.

     

      1159.

     

      The king had a prospect of making still further acquisitions; and the

      activity of his temper suffered no opportunity of that kind to escape him.

      Philippa, duchess of Guienne, mother of Queen Eleanor, was the only issue

      of William IV., count of Toulouse; and would have inherited his dominions,

      had not that prince, desirous of preserving the succession in the male

      line, conveyed the principality to his brother Raymond de St. Gilles, by a

      contract of sale which was in that age regarded as fictitious and

      illusory. By this means the title to the county of Toulouse came to be

      disputed between the male and female heirs; and the one or the other, as

      opportunities favored them, had obtained possession. Raymond, grandson of

      Raymond de St. Gilles was the reigning sovereign; and on Henry’s reviving

      his wife’s claim, this prince had recourse for protection to the king of

      France, who was so much concerned in policy to prevent the further

      aggrandizement of the English monarch. Lewis himself, when married to

      Eleanor, had asserted the justice of her claim, and had demanded

      possession of Toulouse; but his sentiments changing with his interest, he

      now determined to defend, by his power and authority, the title of

      Raymond. Henry found that it would be requisite to support his pretensions

      against potent antagonists; and that nothing but a formidable army could

      maintain a claim which he had in vain asserted by arguments and

      manifestoes.

     

      An army composed of feudal vassals was commonly very intractable and

      undisciplined, both because of the independent spirit of the persons who

      served in it, and because the commands were not given either by the choice

      of the sovereign or from the military capacity and experience of the

      officers. Each baron conducted his own vassals: his rank was greater or

      less, proportioned to the extent of his property: even the supreme command

      under the prince was often attached to birth; and as the military vassals

      were obliged to serve only forty days at their own charge, though, if the

      expedition were distant, they were put to great expense, the prince reaped

      little benefit from their attendance. Henry, sensible of these

      inconveniences, levied upon his vassals in Normandy and other provinces,

      which were remote from Toulouse, a sum of money in lieu of their service;

      and this commutation, by reason of the great distance, was still more

      advantageous to his English vassals. He imposed, therefore, a scutage of

      one hundred and eighty thousand pounds on the knights’ fees, a commutation

      to which, though it was unusual, and the first perhaps to be met with in

      history,[*] 16 the military tenants willingly submitted; and

      with this money he levied an army which was more under his command, and

      whose service was more durable and constant.

     

      Assisted by Berenger, count of Barcelona, and Trincaval, count of Nismes,

      whom he had gained to his party, he invaded the county of Toulouse; and

      after taking Verdun, Castlenau, and other places, he besieged the capital

      of the province, and was likely to prevail in the enterprise; when Lewis,

      advancing before the arrival of his main body, threw himself into the

      place with a small reenforcement. Henry was urged by some of his ministers

      to prosecute the siege, to take Lewis prisoner, and to impose his own

      terms in the pacification; but he either thought it so much his interest

      to maintain the feudal principles, by which his foreign dominions were

      secured, or bore so much respect to his superior lord, that he declared he

      would not attack a place defended by him in person; and he immediately

      raised the siege. He marched into Normandy to protect that province

      against an incursion which the count of Dreux, instigated by King Lewis,

      his brother, had made upon it. War was now openly carried on between the

      two monarchs, but produced no memorable event: it soon ended in a

      cessation of arms, and that followed by a peace, which was not, however,

      attended with any confidence or good correspondence between those rival

      princes.

     

      1160.

     

      The fortress of Gisors, being part of the dowry stipulated to Margaret of

      France, had been consigned by agreement to the knights templars, on

      condition that it should be delivered into Henry’s hands after the

      celebration of the nuptials. The king, that he might have a pretence for

      immediately demanding the place, ordered the marriage to be solemnized

      between the prince and princess, though both infants; and he engaged the

      grand master of the templars, by large presents, as was generally

      suspected, to put him in possession of Gisors.[*]

     

      1161.

     

      Lewis, resenting this fraudulent conduct, banished the templars, and would

      have made war upon the king of England, had it not been for the mediation

      and authority of Pope Alexander III., who had been chased from Rome by the

      antipope, Victor IV., and resided at that time in France.

     

      1162.

     

      Henry, soon after he had accommodated his differences with Lewis by the

      pope’s mediation, returned to England; where he commenced an enterprise,

      which, though required by sound policy, and even conducted in the main

      with prudence, bred him great disquietude, involved him in danger, and was

      not concluded without some loss and dishonor.

     

      The usurpations of the clergy, which had at first been gradual, were now

      become so rapid, and had mounted to such a height, that the contest

      between the regale and pontificale was really arrived at a crisis in

      England; and it became necessary to determine whether the king or the

      priests, particularly the archbishop of Canterbury, should be sovereign of

      the kingdom. The aspiring spirit of Henry, which gave inquietude to all

      his neighbors, was not likely long to pay a tame submission to the

      encroachments of subjects; and as nothing opens the eyes of men so readily

      as their interest, he was in no danger of falling, in this respect, into

      that abject superstition which retained his people in subjection. From the

      commencement of his reign, in the government of his foreign dominions, as

      well as of England, he had shown a fixed purpose to repress clerical

      usurpations, and to maintain those prerogatives which had been transmitted

      to him by his predecessors. During the schism of the papacy between

      Alexander and Victor, he had determined, for some time, to remain neuter;

      and when informed that the archbishop of Rouen and the bishop of Mans had,

      from their own authority, acknowledged Alexander as legitimate pope, he

      was so enraged, that, though he spared the archbishop on account of his

      great age, he immediately issued orders for overthrowing the houses of the

      bishop of Mans and archdeacon of Rouen;[*] 17 and it was not till he

      had deliberately examined the matter, by those views which usually enter

      into the councils of princes, that he allowed that pontiff to exercise

      authority over any of his dominions.

     

      In England, the mild character and advanced years of Theobald, archbishop

      of Canterbury, together with his merits in refusing to put the crown on

      the head of Eustace, son of Stephen, prevented Henry, during the lifetime

      of that primate, from taking any measures against the multiplied

      encroachments of the clergy; but after his death, the king resolved to

      exert himself with more activity; and that he might be secure against any

      opposition, he advanced to that dignity Becket, his chancellor, on whose

      compliance he thought he could entirely depend.

     

      Thomas Ã  Becket, the first man of English descent who, since the Norman

      conquest, had, during the course of a whole century, risen to any

      considerable station, was born of reputable parents in the city of London;

      and being endowed both with industry and capacity, he early insinuated

      himself into the favor of Archbishop Theobald, and obtained from that

      prelate some preferments and offices. By their means he was enabled to

      travel for improvement to Italy, where he studied the civil and canon law

      at Bologna; and on his return he appeared to have made such proficiency in

      knowledge, that he was promoted by his patron to the archdeaconry of

      Canterbury, an office of considerable trust and profit. He was afterwards

      employed with success by Theobald in transacting business at Rome; and on

      Henry’s accession, he was recommended to that monarch as worthy of further

      preferment Henry, who knew that Becket had been instrumental in supporting

      that resolution of the archbishop, which had tended so much to facilitate

      his own advancement to the throne, was already prepossessed in his favor;

      and finding on further acquaintance, that his spirit and abilities

      entitled him to any trust he soon promoted him to the dignity of

      chancellor, one of the first civil offices in the kingdom. The chancellor,

      in that age, besides the custody of the great seal, had possession of all

      vacant prelacies and abbeys; he was the guardian of all such minors and

      pupils as were the king’s tenants; all baronies which escheated to the

      crown were under his administration; he was entitled to a place in

      council, even though he were not particularly summoned; and as he

      exercised also the office of secretary of state, and it belonged to him to

      countersign all commissions, writs, and letters patent, he was a kind of

      prime minister and was concerned in the despatch of every business of

      importance. Besides exercising this high office, Becket by the favor of

      the king or archbishop, was made provost of Beverley, dean of Hastings,

      and constable of the Tower: he was put in possession of the honors of Eye

      and Berkham large baronies that had escheated to the crown; and to

      complete his grandeur, he was intrusted with the education of Prince

      Henry, the king’s eldest son, and heir of the monarchy. The pomp of his

      retinue, the sumptuousness of his furniture, the luxury of his table, the

      munificence of his presents, corresponded to these great preferments; or

      rather exceeded any thing that England had ever before seen in any

      subject. His historian and secretary, Fitz-Stephens, mentions, among other

      particulars, that his apartments were every day in winter covered with

      clean straw or hay, and in summer with green rushes or boughs, lest the

      gentlemen who paid court to him and who could not, by reason of their

      great number, find a place at table, should soil their fine clothes by

      sitting on a dirty floor.[*] A great number of knights were retained in

      his service; the greatest barons were proud of being received at his

      table; his house was a place of education for the sons of the chief

      nobility; and the king himself frequently vouchsafed to partake of his

      entertainments. As his way of life was splendid and opulent, his

      amusements and occupations were gay, and partook of the cavalier spirit,

      which, as he had only taken deacon’s orders, he did not think unbefitting

      his character. He employed himself at leisure hours in hunting, hawking,

      gaming, and horsemanship; he exposed his person in several military

      actions; he carried over, at his own charge, seven hundred knights to

      attend the king in his wars at Toulouse; in the subsequent wars on the

      frontiers of Normandy, he maintained, during forty days, twelve hundred

      knights, and four thousand of their train; and in an embassy to France,

      with which he was intrusted, he astonished that court by the number and

      magnificence of his retinue.

     

      Henry, besides committing all his more important business to Becket’s

      management, honored him with his friendship and intimacy; and whenever he

      was disposed to relax himself by sports of any kind, he admitted his

      chancellor to the party. An instance of their familiarity is mentioned by

      Fitz-Stephens which, as it shows the manners of the age, it may not be

      improper to relate. One day, as the king and the chancellor were riding

      together in the streets of London, they observed a beggar, who was

      shivering with cold. “Would it not be very praiseworthy,” said the king,

      “to give that poor man a warm coat in this severe season?” “It would,

      surely,” replied the chancellor; “and you do well, sir, in thinking of

      such good actions.” “Then he shall have one presently,” cried the king;

      and seizing the skirt of the chancellor’s coat, which was scarlet, and

      lined with ermine, began to pull it violently. The chancellor defended

      himself for some time; and they had both of them like to have tumbled off

      their horses in the street, when Becket, after a vehement struggle, let go

      his coat; which the king bestowed on the beggar, who, being ignorant of

      the quality of the persons, was not a little surprised at the present.

     

      Becket, who, by his complaisance and good humor, had rendered himself

      agreeable, and by his industry and abilities useful, to his master,

      appeared to him the fittest person for supplying the vacancy made by the

      death of Theobold. As he was well acquainted with the king’s intentions of

      retrenching, or rather confining within the ancient bounds, all

      ecclesiastical privileges, and always showed a ready disposition to comply

      with them, Henry, who never expected any resistance from that quarter,

      immediately issued orders for electing him archbishop of Canterbury. But

      this resolution, which was taken contrary to the opinion of Matilda, and

      many of the ministers, drew after it very unhappy consequences; and never

      prince of so great penetration appeared, in the issue, to have so little

      understood the genius and character of his minister.

     

      No sooner was Becket installed in this high dignity, which rendered him

      for life the second person in the kingdom, with some pretensions of

      aspiring to be the first, than he totally altered his demeanor and

      conduct, and endeavored to acquire the character of sanctity, of which his

      former busy and ostentatious course of life might, in the eyes of the

      people, have naturally bereaved him. Without consulting the king, he

      immediately returned into his hands the commission of chancellor;

      pretending that he must thenceforth detach himself from secular affairs,

      and be solely employed in the exercise of his spiritual function; but in

      reality, that he might break off all connections with Henry, and apprise

      him that Becket, as primate of England, was now become entirely a new

      personage. He maintained, in his retinue and attendants alone, his ancient

      pomp and lustre, which was useful to strike the vulgar; in his own person

      he affected the greatest austerity and most rigid mortification, which he

      was sensible would have an equal or a greater tendency to the same end. He

      wore sackcloth next his skin, which, by his affected care to conceal it,

      was necessarily the more remarked by all the world: he changed it so

      seldom, that it was filled with dirt and vermin: his usual diet was bread;

      his drink water, which he even rendered further unpalatable by the mixture

      of unsavory herbs: he tore his back with the frequent discipline which he

      inflicted on it: he daily on his knees washed, in imitation of Christ, the

      feet of thirteen beggars, whom he afterwards dismissed with presents: he

      gained the affections of the monks by his frequent charities to the

      convents and hospitals: every one who made profession of sanctity, was

      admitted to his conversation, and returned full of panegyrics on the

      humility, as well as on the piety and mortification, of the holy primate:

      he seemed to be perpetually employed in reciting prayers and pious

      lectures, or in perusing religious discourses: his aspect wore the

      appearance of seriousness, and mental recollection, and secret devotion;

      and all men of penetration plainly saw that he was meditating some great

      design, and that the ambition and ostentation of his character had turned

      itself towards a new and a more dangerous object.

     

      1163.

     

      Becket waited not till Henry should commence those projects against the

      ecclesiastical power, which he knew had been formed by that prince: he was

      himself the aggressor, and endeavored to overawe the king by the

      intrepidity and boldness of his enterprises. He summoned the earl of Clare

      to surrender the barony of Tunbridge, which, ever since the conquest, had

      remained in the family of that nobleman, but which, as it had formerly

      belonged to the see of Canterbury, Becket pretended his predecessors were

      prohibited by the canons to alienate. The earl of Clare, besides the

      lustre which he derived from the greatness of his own birth and the extent

      of his possessions, was allied to all the principal families in the

      kingdom; his sister, who was a celebrated beauty, had further extended his

      credit among the nobility and was even supposed to have gained the king’s

      affections; and Becket could not better discover, than by attacking so

      powerful an interest, his resolution of maintaining with vigor the rights,

      real or pretended, of his see.

     

      William de Eynsford, a military tenant of the crown, was patron of a

      living which belonged to a manor that held of the archbishop of

      Canterbury; but Becket, without regard to William’s right, presented, on a

      new and illegal pretext, one Laurence to that living, who was violently

      expelled by Eynsford. The primate, making himself, as was usual in

      spiritual courts, both judge and party, issued in a summary manner the

      sentence of excommunication against Eynsford, who complained to the king,

      that he, who held “in capite” of the crown, should, contrary to the

      practice established by the Conqueror, and maintained ever since by his

      successors, be subjected to that terrible sentence without the previous

      consent of the sovereign. Henry, who had now broken off all personal

      intercourse with Becket, sent him, by a messenger, his orders to absolve

      Eynsford; but received for answer, that it belonged not for the king to

      inform him whom he should absolve and whom excommunicate; and it was not

      till after many remonstrances and menaces that Becket, though with the

      worst grace imaginable, was induced to comply with the royal mandate.

     

      Henry, though he found himself thus grievously mistaken in the character

      of the person whom he had promoted to the primacy, determined not to

      desist from his former intention of retrenching clerical usurpations. He

      was entirely master of his extensive dominions: the prudence and vigor of

      his administration, attended with perpetual success, had raised his

      character above that of any of his predecessors: the papacy seemed to be

      weakened by a schism which divided all Europe; and he rightly judged that,

      if the present favorable opportunity were neglected, the crown must, from

      the prevalent superstition of the people, be in danger of falling into

      entire subordination under the mitre.

     

      The union of the civil and ecclesiastical power serves extremely, in every

      civilized government, to the maintenance of peace and order; and prevents

      those mutual encroachments which, as there can be no ultimate judge

      between them, are often attended with the most dangerous consequences

      Whether the supreme magistrate who unites these powers receives the

      appellation of prince or prelate, is not material. The superior weight

      which temporal interests commonly bear in the apprehensions of men above

      spiritual, renders the civil part of his character most prevalent; and in

      time prevents those gross impostures and bigoted persecutions which, in

      all false religions, are the chief foundation of clerical authority. But

      during the progress of ecclesiastical usurpations, the state, by the

      resistance of the civil magistrate, is naturally thrown into convulsions;

      and it behoves the prince, both for his own interest and for that of the

      public, to provide in time sufficient barriers against so dangerous and

      insidious a rival. This precaution had hitherto been much neglected in

      England, as well as in other Catholic countries; and affairs at last

      seemed to have come to a dangerous crisis: a sovereign of the greatest

      abilities was now on the throne: a prelate of the most inflexible and

      intrepid character was possessed of the primacy: the contending powers

      appeared to be armed with their full force and it was natural to expect

      some extraordinary event to result from their conflict.

     

      Among their other inventions to obtain money, the clergy had inculcated

      the necessity of penance as an atonement for sin; and having again

      introduced the practice of paying them large sums as a commutation, or

      species of atonement for the remission of those penances, the sins of the

      people, by these means, had become a revenue to the priests; and the king

      computed, that by this invention alone they levied more money upon his

      subjects than flowed, by all the funds and taxes, into the royal

      exchequer. That he might ease the people of so heavy and arbitrary an

      imposition, Henry required that a civil officer of his appointment should

      be present in all ecclesiastical courts, and should, for the future, give

      his consent to every composition which was made with sinners for their

      spiritual offences.

     

      The ecclesiastics in that age had renounced all immediate subordination to

      the magistrate: they openly pretended to an exemptior, in criminal

      accusations, from a trial before courts of justice; and were gradually

      introducing a like exemption in civil causes: spiritual penalties alone

      could be inflicted on their offences; and as the clergy had extremely

      multiplied in England, and many of them were consequently of very low

      characters, crimes of the deepest dye—murders, robberies,

      adulteries, rapes—were daily committed with impunity by the

      ecclesiastics. It had been found, for instance, on inquiry, that no less

      than a hundred murders had, since the king’s accession, been perpetrated

      by men of that profession, who had never been called to account for these

      offences; and holy orders were become a full protection for all

      enormities. A clerk in Worcestershire, having debauched a gentleman’s

      daughter, had, at this time, proceeded to murder the father; and the

      general indignation against this crime moved the king to attempt the

      remedy of an abuse which was become so palpable, and to require that the

      clerk should be delivered up, and receive condign punishment from the

      magistrate. Becket insisted on the privileges of the church; confined the

      criminal in the bishop’s prison, lest he should be seized by the king’s

      officers; maintained that no greater punishment could be inflicted on him

      than degradation; and when the king demanded that, immediately after he

      was degraded, he should be tried by the civil power, the primate asserted

      that it was iniquitous to try a man twice upon the same accusation, and

      for the same offence.

     

      Henry, laying hold of so plausible a pretence, resolved to push the clergy

      with regard to all their privileges, which they had raised to an enormous

      height, and to determine at once those controversies which daily

      multiplied between the civil and the ecclesiastical jurisdictions. He

      summoned an assembly of all the prelates in England; and he put to them

      this concise and decisive question, whether or not they were willing to

      submit to the ancient laws and customs of the kingdom? The bishops

      unanimously replied, that they were willing, “saving their own order;” a

      device by which they thought to elude the present urgency of the king’s

      demand, yet reserve to themselves, on a favorable opportunity, the power

      of resuming all their pretensions. The king was sensible of the artifice,

      and was provoked to the highest indignation. He left the assembly with

      visible marks of his displeasure: he required the primate instantly to

      surrender the honors and castles of Eye and Berkham: the bishops were

      terrified, and expected still further effects of his resentment. Becket

      alone was inflexible; and nothing but the interposition of the pope’s

      legate and almoner, Philip, who dreaded a breach with so powerful a prince

      at so unseasonable a juncture, could have prevailed on him to retract the

      saving clause, and give a general and absolute promise of observing the

      ancient customs.

     

      But Henry was not content with a declaration in these general terms; he

      resolved, ere it was too late, to define expressly those customs with

      which he required compliance, and to put a stop to clerical usurpations,

      before they were fully consolidated, and could plead antiquity, as they

      already did a sacred authority, in their favor. The claims of the church

      were open and visible. After a gradual and insensible progress during many

      centuries, the mask had at last been taken off, and several ecclesiastical

      councils, by their canons, which were pretended to be irrevocable and

      infallible, had positively defined those privileges and immunities which

      gave such general offence, and appeared so dangerous to the civil

      magistrate. Henry, therefore, deemed it necessary to define with the same

      precision the limits of the civil power; to oppose his legal customs to

      their divine ordinances; to determine the exact boundaries of the rival

      jurisdictions; and for this purpose he summoned a general council of the

      nobility and prelates at Clarendon, to whom he submitted this great and

      important question. [15th Jan. 1164.]

     

      The barons were all gained to the king’s party, either by the reasons

      which he urged, or by his superior authority. The bishops were overawed by

      the general combination against them; and the following laws, commonly

      called the “Constitutions of Clarendon,” were voted without opposition by

      this assembly. It was enacted, that all suits concerning the advowson and

      presentation of churches should be determined in the civil courts: that

      the churches, belonging to the king’s fee, should not be granted in

      perpetuity without his consent; that clerks, accused of any crime, should

      be tried in the civil courts: that no person, particularly no clergyman of

      any rank, should depart the kingdom without the king’s license: that

      excommunicated persons should not be bound to give security for continuing

      in their present place of abode: that laics should not be accused in

      spiritual courts, except by legal and reputable promoters and witnesses:

      that no chief tenant of the crown should be excommunicated, nor his lands

      be put under an interdict, except with the king’s consent: that all

      appeals in spiritual causes should be carried from the archdeacon to the

      bishop, from the bishop to the primate, from him to the king; and should

      be carried no farther without the king’s consent: that if any lawsuit

      arose between a layman and a clergyman concerning a tenant, and it be

      disputed whether the land be a lay or an ecclesiastical fee, it should

      first be determined by the verdict of twelve lawful men to what class it

      belonged; and if it be found to be a lay fee, the cause should finally be

      determined in the civil courts: that no inhabitant in demesne should be

      excommunicated for non-appearance in a spiritual court, till the chief

      officer of the place where he resides be consulted, that he may compel him

      by the civil authority to give satisfaction to the church: that the

      archbishops, bishops, and other spiritual dignitaries, should be regarded

      as barons of the realm; should possess the privileges and be subjected to

      the burdens belonging to that rank; and should be bound to attend the king

      in his great councils, and assist at all trials, till the sentence, either

      of death or loss of members, be given against the criminal: that the

      revenue of vacant sees should belong to the king; the chapter, or such of

      them as he pleases to summon, should sit in the king’s chapel till they

      made the new election with his consent, and that the bishop elect should

      do homage to the crown: that if any baron or tenant “in capite” should

      refuse to submit to the spiritual courts, the king should employ his

      authority in obliging him to make such submissions; if any of them throw

      off his allegiance to the king, the prelates should assist the king with

      their censures in reducing him: that goods forfeited to the king should

      not be protected in churches or churchyards: that the clergy should no

      longer pretend to the right of enforcing payment of debts contracted by

      oath or promise; but should leave these lawsuits, equally with others, to

      the determination of the civil courts; and that the sons of villains

      should not be ordained clerks, without the consent of their lord.

     

      These articles, to the number of sixteen, were calculated to prevent the

      chief abuses which had prevailed in ecclesiastical affairs, and to put an

      effectual stop to the usurpations of the church, which, gradually stealing

      on, had threatened the total destruction of the civil power. Henry,

      therefore, by reducing those ancient customs of the realm to writing, and

      by collecting them in a body, endeavored to prevent all future dispute

      with regard to them; and by passing so many ecclesiastical ordinances in a

      national and civil assembly, he fully established the superiority of the

      legislature above all papal decrees or spiritual canons, and gained a

      signal victory over the ecclesiastics. But as he knew that the bishops,

      though overawed by the present combination of the crown and the barons,

      would take the first favorable opportunity of denying the authority which

      had enacted these constitutions, he resolved that they should all set

      their seal to them, and give a promise to observe them. None of the

      prelates dared to oppose his will, except Becket, who, though urged by the

      earls of Cornwall and Leicester, the barons of principal authority in the

      kingdom, obstinately withheld his assent. At last, Richard de Hastings,

      grand prior of the templars in England, threw himself on his knees before

      him, and with many tears entreated him, if he paid any regard either to

      his own safety or that of the church, not to provoke, by a fruitless

      opposition, the indignation of a great monarch, who was resolutely bent on

      his purpose, and who was determined to take full revenge on every one that

      should dare to oppose him. Becket, finding himself deserted by all the

      world, even by his own brethren, was at last obliged to comply; and he

      promised, “legally, with good faith, and without fraud or reserve,” to

      observe the constitutions; and he took an oath to that purpose. The king,

      thinking that he had now finally prevailed in this great enterprise, sent

      the constitutions to Pope Alexander, who then resided in France; and he

      required that pontiff’s ratification of them; but Alexander, who, though

      he had owed the most important obligations to the king, plainly saw that

      these laws were calculated to establish the independency of England on the

      papacy, and of the royal power on the clergy, condemned them in the

      strongest terms; abrogated, annulled, and rejected them. There were only

      six articles, the least important, which, for the sake of peace, he was

      willing to ratify.

     

      Becket, when he observed that he might hope for support in an opposition,

      expressed the deepest sorrow for his compliance; and endeavored to engage

      all the other bishops in a confederacy to adhere to their common rights,

      and to the ecclesiastical privileges, in which he represented the interest

      and honor of God to be so deeply concerned. He redoubled his austerities

      in order to punish himself for his criminal assent to the constitutions of

      Clarendon: he proportioned his discipline to the enormity of his supposed

      offence: and he refused to exercise any part of his archiepiscopal

      function, till he should receive absolution from the pope, which was

      readily granted him. Henry, informed of his present dispositions, resolved

      to take vengeance for this refractory behavior; and he attempted to crush

      him by means of that very power which Becket made such merit in

      supporting. He applied to the pope that he should grant the commission of

      legate in his dominions to the archbishop of York; but Alexander, as

      politic as he, though he granted the commission, annexed a clause, that it

      should not empower the legate to execute any act in prejudice of the

      archbishop of Canterbury: and the king, finding how fruitless such an

      authority would prove, sent back the commission by the same messenger that

      brought it.

     

      The primate, however, who found himself still exposed to the king’s

      indignation, endeavored twice to escape secretly from the kingdom; but was

      as often detained by contrary winds: and Henry hastened to make him feel

      the effects of an obstinacy which he deemed so criminal. He instigated

      John, mareschal of the exchequer, to sue Becket in the archiepiscopal

      court for some lands, part of the manor of Pageham; and to appeal thence

      to the king’s court for justice. On the day appointed for trying the

      cause, the primate sent four knights to represent certain irregularities

      in John’s appeal; and at the same time to excuse himself, on account of

      sickness, for not appearing personally that day in the court. This slight

      offence (if it even deserve the name) was represented as a grievous

      contempt; the four knights were menaced, and with difficulty escaped being

      sent to prison, as offering falsehoods to the court;[*] 18 and

      Henry, being determined to prosecute Becket to the utmost, summoned at

      Northampton a great council, which he purposed to make the instrument of

      his vengeance against the inflexible prelate.

     

      [* See note R, at the end of the volume.]

     

      The king had raised Becket from a low station to the highest offices, had

      honored him with his countenance and friendship, had trusted to his

      assistance in forwarding his favorite project against the clergy; and when

      he found him become of a sudden his most rigid opponent, while every one

      beside complied with his will, rage at the disappointment, and indignation

      against such signal ingratitude, transported him beyond all bounds of

      moderation; and there seems to have entered more of passion than of

      justice, or even of policy, in this violent prosecution. The barons,

      notwithstanding, in the great council voted whatever sentence he was

      pleased to dictate to them; and the bishops themselves, who undoubtedly

      bore a secret favor to Becket, and regarded him as the champion of their

      privileges, concurred with the rest in the design of oppressing their

      primate. In vain did Becket urge that his court was proceeding with the

      utmost regularity and justice in trying the mareschal’s cause; which,

      however, he said, would appear, from the sheriff’s testimony, to be

      entirely unjust and iniquitous: that he himself had discovered no contempt

      of the king’s court; but, on the contrary, by sending four knights to

      excuse his absence, had virtually acknowledged its authority: that he

      also, in consequence of the king’s summons, personally appeared at present

      in the great council, ready to justify his cause against the mareschal,

      and to submit his conduct to their inquiry and jurisdiction: that even

      should it be found that he had been guilty of non-appearance, the laws had

      affixed a very slight penalty to that offence; and that as he was an

      inhabitant of Kent, where his archiepiscopal palace was seated, he was by

      law entitled to some greater indulgence than usual in the rate of his

      fine. Notwithstanding these pleas, he was condemned as guilty of a

      contempt of the king’s court, and as wanting in the fealty which he had

      sworn to his sovereign; all his goods and chattels were confiscated; and

      that this triumph over the church might be carried to the utmost, Henry,

      bishop of Winchester, the prelate who had been so powerful in the former

      reign, was in spite of his remonstrances, obliged, by order of the court,

      to pronounce the sentence against him. The primate submitted to the

      decree; and all the prelates, except Folliot, bishop of London, who paid

      court to the king by this singularity, became sureties for him. It is

      remarkable, that several Norman barons voted in this council; and we may

      conclude, with some probability, that a like practice had prevailed in

      many of the great councils summoned since the conquest. For the

      contemporary historian, who has given us a full account of these

      transactions, does not mention this circumstance as anywise singular; and

      Becket, in all his subsequent remonstrances with regard to the severe

      treatment which he had met with, never founds any objection on an

      irregularity, which to us appears very palpable and flagrant. So little

      precision was there at that time in the government and constitution!

     

      The king was not content with this sentence, however violent and

      oppressive. Next day he demanded of Becket the sum of three hundred

      pounds, which the primate had levied upon the honors of Eye and Berkham,

      while in his possession. Becket, after premising that he was not obliged

      to answer to this suit, because it was not contained in his summons; after

      remarking that he had expended more than that sum in the repairs of those

      castles, and of the royal palace at London, expressed, however, his

      resolution, that money should not be any ground of quarrel between him and

      his sovereign; he agreed to pay the sum, and immediately gave sureties for

      it. In the subsequent meeting, the king demanded five hundred marks,

      which, he affirmed, he had lent Becket during the war at Toulouse; and

      another sum to the same amount, for which that prince had been surety for

      him to a Jew. Immediately after these two claims, he preferred a third, of

      still greater importance; he required him to give in the accounts of his

      administration while chancellor, and to pay the balance due from the

      revenues of all the prelacies, abbeys, and baronies, which had, during

      that time, been subjected to his management.[*] Becket observed that, as

      this demand was totally unexpected, he had not come prepared to answer it;

      but he required a delay, and promised in that case to give satisfaction.

      The king insisted upon sureties; and Becket desired leave to consult his

      suffragans in a case of such importance.[**]

     

      It is apparent, from the known character of Henry, and from the usual

      vigilance of his government, that, when he promoted Becket to the see of

      Canterbury, he was, on good grounds, well pleased with his administration

      in the former high office with which he had intrusted him; and that, even

      if that prelate had dissipated money beyond the income of his place, the

      king was satisfied that his expenses were not blamable, and had in the

      main been calculated for his service.[***] Two years had since elapsed; no

      demand had during that time been made upon him; it was not till the

      quarrel arose concerning ecclesiastical privileges, that the claim was

      started, and the primate was, of a sudden, required to produce accounts of

      such intricacy and extent before a tribunal which had shown a determined

      resolution to ruin and oppress him. To find sureties that he should answer

      so boundless and uncertain a claim, which in the king’s estimation

      amounted to forty-four thousand marks,[****] was impracticable; and

      Becket’s suffragans were extremely at a loss what counsel to give him in

      such a critical emergency. By the advice of the bishop of Winchester he

      offered two thousand marks as a general satisfaction for all demands; but

      this offer was rejected by the king,[*****] Some prelates exhorted him to

      resign his see, on condition of receiving an acquittal; others were of

      opinion that he ought to submit himself entirely to the king’s

      mercy;[******] but the primate, thus pushed to the utmost, had too much

      courage to sink under oppression; he determined to brave all his enemies,

      to trust to the sacredness of his character for protection, to involve his

      cause with that of God and religion, and to stand the utmost efforts of

      royal indignation.

     

      After a few days spent in deliberation Becket went to church, and said

      mass, where he had previously ordered that the entroit to the communion

      service should begin with these words, “Princes sat and spake against me;”

       the passage appointed for the martyrdom of St. Stephen, whom the primate

      thereby tacitly pretended to resemble in his sufferings for the sake of

      righteousness. He went thence to court arrayed in his sacred vestments: as

      soon as he arrived within the palace gate, he took the cross into his own

      hands, bore it aloft as his protection, and marched in that posture into

      the royal apartments.[*] The king, who was in an inner room, was

      astonished at this parade, by which the primate seemed to menace him and

      his court with the sentence of excommunication; and he sent some of the

      prelates to remonstrate with him on account of such audacious behavior.

      These prelates complained to Becket, that, by subscribing himself to the

      constitutions of Clarendon, he had seduced them to imitate his example;

      and that now, when it was too late, he pretended to shake off all

      subordination to the civil power, and appeared desirous of involving them

      in the guilt which must attend any violation of those laws, established by

      their consent and ratified by their subscriptions.[**]

     

      Becket replied, that he had indeed subscribed the constitutions of

      Clarendon, “legally, with good faith, and without fraud or reserve;” but

      in these words was virtually implied a salvo for the rights of their

      order, which, being connected with the cause of God and his church, could

      never be relinquished by their oaths and engagements: that if he and they

      had erred in resigning the ecclesiastical privileges, the best atonement

      they could now make was to retract their consent, which in such a case

      could never Be obligatory, and to follow the pope’s authority, who had

      solemnly annulled the constitutions of Clarendon, and had absolved them

      from all oaths which they had taken to observe them: that a determined

      resolution was evidently embraced to oppress the church; the storm had

      first broken upon him; for a slight offence, and which too was falsely

      imputed to him, he had been tyrannically condemned to a grievous penalty;

      a new and unheard-of claim was since started, in which he could expect no

      justice; and he plainly saw that he was the destined victim, who, by his

      ruin, must prepare the way for the abrogation of all spiritual immunities:

      that he strictly prohibited them who were his suffragans from assisting at

      any such trial, or giving their sanction to any sentence against him; he

      put himself and his see under the protection of the supreme pontiff; and

      appealed to him against any penalty which his iniquitous judges might

      think proper to inflict upon him; and that, however terrible the

      indignation of so great a monarch as Henry, his sword could only kill the

      body; while that of the church, intrusted into the hands of the primate,

      could kill the soul, and throw the disobedient into infinite and eternal

      perdition.[*]

     

      Appeals to the pope, even in ecclesiastical causes, had been abolished by

      the constitutions of Clarendon, and were become criminal by law but an

      appeal in a civil cause, such as the king’s demand upon Becket, was a

      practice altogether new and unprecedented; it tended directly to the

      subversion of the government, and could receive no color of excuse, except

      from the determined resolution, which was but too apparent to Henry and

      the great council, to effectuate, without justice, but under color of law,

      the total ruin of the inflexible primate. The king, having now obtained a

      pretext so much more plausible for his violence, would probably have

      pushed the affair to the utmost extremity against him; but Becket gave him

      no leisure to conduct the prosecution. He refused so much as to hear the

      sentence which the barons, sitting apart from the bishops, and joined to

      some sheriffs and barons of the second rank,[**] had given upon the king’s

      claim; he departed from the palace; asked Henry’s immediate permission to

      leave Northampton; and upon meeting with a refusal, he withdrew secretly,

      wandered about in disguise for some time, and at last took shipping and

      arrived safely at Gravelines.

     

      The violent and unjust prosecution of Becket had a natural tendency to

      turn the public favor on his side, and to make men overlook his former

      ingratitude towards the king and his departure from all oaths and

      engagements, as well as the enormity of those ecclesiastical privileges,

      of which he affected to be the champion. There were many other reasons

      which procured him countenance and protection in foreign countries.

      Philip, earl of Flanders,[*] and Lewis, king of France,[**] jealous of the

      rising greatness of Henry, were well pleased to give him disturbance in

      his government; and forgetting that this was the common cause of princes,

      they affected to pity extremely the condition of the exiled primate; and

      the latter even honored him with a visit at Soissons, in which city he had

      invited him to fix his residence.[***]

     

      The pope, whose interests were more immediately concerned in supporting

      him, gave a cold reception to a magnificent embassy which Henry sent to

      accuse him; while Becket himself, who had come to Sens in order to justify

      his cause before the sovereign pontiff was received with the greatest

      marks of distinction. The king in revenge, sequestered the revenues of

      Canterbury; and by conduct which might be esteemed arbitrary, had there

      been at that time any regular check on royal authority, he banished all

      the primate’s relations and domestics, to the number of four hundred, whom

      he obliged to swear, before their departure, that they would instantly

      join their patron. But this policy, by which Henry endeavored to reduce

      Becket sooner to necessity, lost its effect; the pope, when they arrived

      beyond sea, absolved them from their oath, and distributed them among the

      convents in Franc? and Flanders; a residence was assigned to Becket

      himself, in the convent of Pontigny, where he lived for some years in

      great magnificence, partly from a pension granted him on the revenues of

      that abbey, partly from remittances made him by the French monarch.

     

      1165.

     

      The more to ingratiate himself with the pope, Becket resigned into his

      hands the see of Canterbury, to which, he affirmed, he had been

      uncanonically elected, by the authority of the royal mandate; and

      Alexander, in his turn, besides investing him anew with that dignity,

      pretended to abrogate by a bull, the sentence which the great council of

      England had passed against him. Henry, after attempting in vain to procure

      a conference with the pope, who departed soon after for Rome, whither the

      prosperous state of his affairs now invited him, made provisions against

      the consequences of that breach which impended between his kingdom and the

      apostolic see. He issued orders to his justiciaries, inhibiting, under

      severe penalties, all appeals to the pope or archbishop, forbidding any

      one to receive any mandates from them, or apply in any case to their

      authority; declaring it treasonable to bring from either of them an

      interdict upon the kingdom, and punishable in secular clergymen, by the

      loss of their eyes and by castration, in regulars by amputation of their

      feet, and in laies with death; and menacing with sequestration and

      banishment the persons themselves, as well as their kindred, who should

      pay obedience to any such interdict; and he further obliged all his

      subjects to swear to the observance of those orders.[*] These were edicts

      of the utmost importance, affected the lives and properties of all the

      subjects, and even changed, for the time, the national religion, by

      breaking off all communication with Rome; yet were they enacted by the

      sole authority of the king, and were derived entirely from his will and

      pleasure.

     

      The spiritual powers, which, in the primitive church, were, in a great

      measure, dependent on the civil, had, by a gradual progress, reached an

      equality and independence; and though the limits of the two jurisdictions

      were difficult to ascertain or define, it was not impossible but, by

      moderation on both sides, government might still have been conducted in

      that imperfect and irregular manner which attends all human institutions

      But as the ignorance of the age encouraged the ecclesiastics daily to

      extend their privileges, and even to advance maxims totally incompatible

      with civil government,[**] Henry had thought it high time to put an end to

      their pretensions, and formally, in a public council, to fix those powers

      which belonged to the magistrate, and which he was for the future

      determined to maintain. In this attempt he was led to reestablish customs

      which, though ancient, were beginning to be abolished by a contrary

      practice, and which were still more strongly opposed by the prevailing

      opinions and sentiments of the age.

     

      Principle, therefore, stood on the one side, power on the other; and if

      the English had been actuated by conscience more than by present interest,

      the controversy must soon, by the general defection of Henry’s subjects,

      have been decided against him, Becket, in order to forward this event,

      filled all places with exclamations against the violence which he had

      suffered. He compared himself to Christ, who had been condemned by a lay

      tribunal,[*] and who was crucified anew in the present oppressions under

      which his church labored: he took it for granted, as a point

      incontestable, that his cause was the cause of God:[**] he assumed the

      character of champion for the patrimony of the divinity: he pretended to

      be the spiritual father of the king and all the people of England:[***] he

      even told Henry that kings reign solely by the authority of the

      church,[****] and though he had thus torn off the veil more openly on the

      one side than that prince had on the other, he seemed still, from the

      general favor borne him by the ecclesiastics, to have all the advantage in

      the argument. The king, that he might employ the weapons of temporal power

      remaining in his hands, suspended the payment of Peter’s pence; he made

      advances towards an alliance with the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, who was

      at that time engaged in violent wars with Pope Alexander; he discovered

      some intentions of acknowledging Pascal III., the present antipope, who

      was protected by that emperor; and by these expedients he endeavored to

      terrify the enterprising though prudent pontiff from proceeding to

      extremities against him.

     

      1166.

     

      But the violence of Becket, still more than the nature of the controversy,

      kept affairs from remaining long in suspense between the parties. That

      prelate, instigated by revenge, and animated by the present glory

      attending his situation, pushed matters to a decision, and issued a

      censure excommunicating the king’s chief ministers by name, and

      comprehending in general all those who favored or obeyed the constitutions

      of Clarendon: these constitutions he abrogated and annulled; he absolved

      all men from the oaths which they had taken to observe them; and he

      suspended the spiritual thunder over Henry himself only that the prince

      might avoid the blow by a timely repentance.[*****]

     

      The situation of Henry was so unhappy, that he could employ no expedient

      for saving his ministers from this terrible censure, but by appealing to

      the pope himself, and having recourse to a tribunal whose authority he had

      himself attempted to abridge in this very article of appeals, and which he

      knew was so deeply engaged on the side of his adversary. But even this

      expedient was not likely to be long effectual. Becket had obtained from

      the pope a legantine commission over England; and in virtue of that

      authority, which admitted of no appeal, he summoned the bishops of London,

      Salisbury, and others to attend him, and ordered, under pain of

      excommunication, the ecclesiastics, sequestered on his account, to be

      restored in two months to all their benefices. But John of Oxford, the

      king’s agent with the pope, had the address to procure orders for

      suspending this sentence; and he gave the pontiff such hopes of a speedy

      reconcilement between the king and Becket, that two legates, William of

      Pavia and Otho, were sent to Normandy, where the king then resided, and

      they endeavored to find expedients for that purpose. But the pretensions

      of the parties were as yet too opposite to admit of an accommodation: the

      king required that all the constitutions of Clarendon should be ratified;

      Becket, that previously to any agreement, he and his adherents should be

      restored to their possessions; and as the legates had no power to

      pronounce a definite sentence on either side, the negotiation soon after

      came to nothing. The cardinal of Pavia also, being much attached to Henry,

      took care to protract the negotiation; to mitigate the pope by the

      accounts which he sent of that prince’s conduct, and to procure him every

      possible indulgence from the see of Rome. About this time, the king had

      also the address to obtain a dispensation for the marriage of his third

      son, Geoffrey, with the heiress of Brittany; a concession which,

      considering Henry’s demerits towards the church, gave great scandal both

      to Becket, and to his zealous patron, the king of France.

     

      1167.

     

      The intricacies of the feudal law had, in that age, rendered the

      boundaries of power between the prince and his vassals, and between one

      prince and another, as uncertain as those between the crown and the mitre;

      and all wars took their origin from disputes, which, had there been any

      tribunal possessed of power to enforce their decrees, ought to have been

      decided only before a court of judicature. Henry, in prosecution of some

      controversies in which he was involved with the count of Auvergne, a

      vassal of the duchy of Guienne, bad invaded the territories of that

      nobleman; who had recourse to the king of France, his superior lord, for

      protection, and thereby kindled a war between the two monarchs. Bur the

      war was, as usual, no less feeble in its operations than it wail frivolous

      in its cause and object; and after occasioning some mutual

      depredations,[*] and some insurrections among the barons of Poictou and

      Guienne, was terminated by a peace. The terms of this peace were rather

      disadvantageous to Henry, and prove that that prince had, by reason of his

      contest with the church, lost the superiority which he had hitherto

      maintained over the crown of France; an additional motive to him for

      accommodating those differences.

     

      The pope and the king began at last to perceive that, in the present

      situation of affairs, neither of them could expect a final and decisive

      victory over the other, and that they had more to fear than to hope from

      the duration of the controversy. Though the vigor of Henry’s government

      had confirmed his authority in all his dominions, his throne might be

      shaken by a sentence of excommunication; and if England itself could, by

      its situation, be more easily guarded against the contagion of

      superstitious prejudices, his French provinces at least, whose

      communication was open with the neighboring states, would be much exposed,

      on that account, to some great revolution or convulsion, He could not,

      therefore, reasonably imagine that the pope, while he retained such a

      check upon him, would formally recognize the constitutions of Clarendon,

      which both put an end to papal pretensions in England,[**] and would give

      an example to other states of asserting a like independency.[***]

     

      Pope Alexander, on the other hand, being still engaged in dangerous wars

      with the emperor Frederic, might justly apprehend that Henry, rather than

      relinquish claims of such importance, would join the party of his enemy;

      and as the trials hitherto made of the spiritual weapons by Becket had not

      succeeded to his expectation, and every thing had remained quiet in all

      the king’s dominions, nothing seemed impossible to the capacity and

      vigilance of so great a monarch. The disposition of minds on both sides,

      resulting from these circumstances, produced frequent attempts towards an

      accommodation; but as both parties knew that the essential articles of the

      dispute could not then be terminated, they entertained a perpetual

      jealousy of each other, and were anxious not to lose the least advantage

      in the negotiation. The nuncios, Gratian and Vivian, having received a

      commission to endeavor a reconciliation, met with the king in Normandy;

      and after all differences seemed to be adjusted, Henry offered to sign the

      treaty, with a salvo to his royal dignity; which gave such umbrage to

      Becket, that the negotiation in the end became fruitless, and the

      excommunications were renewed against the king’s ministers. Another

      negotiation was conducted at Montmirail, in presence of the king of France

      and the French prelates where Becket also offered to make his submissions,

      with a salvo to the honor of God and the liberties of the church; which,

      for a like reason, was extremely offensive to the king, and rendered the

      treaty abortive,

     

      1169.

     

      A third conference, under the same mediation, was broken off, by Becket’s

      insisting on a like reserve in his submissions; and even in a fourth

      treaty, when all the terms were adjusted, and when the primate expected to

      be introduced to the king, and to receive the kiss of peace, which it was

      usual for princes to grant in those times, and which was regarded as a

      sure pledge of forgiveness, Henry refused him that honor, under pretence

      that, during his anger, he had made a rash vow to that purpose. This

      formality served, among such jealous spirits, to prevent the conclusion of

      the treaty; and though the difficulty was attempted to be overcome by a

      dispensation which the pope granted to Henry from his vow, that prince

      could not be pre vailed on to depart from the resolution which he had

      taken.

     

      In one of these conferences, at which the French king was present, Henry

      said to that monarch, “There have been many kings of England, some of

      greater, some of less authority than myself: there have also been many

      archbishops of Canterbury, holy and good men, and entitled to every kind

      of respect: let Becket but act towards me with the same submission which

      the greatest of his predecessors have paid to the least of mine, and there

      shall be no controversy between us.” Lewis was so struck with this state

      of the case, and with an offer which Henry made to submit his cause to the

      French clergy, that he could not forbear condemning the primate, and

      withdrawing his friendship from him during some time; but the bigotry of

      that prince, and their common animosity against Henry, soon produced a

      renewal of their former good correspondence.

     

      1170.

     

      All difficulties were at last adjusted between the parties; and the king

      allowed Becket to return, on conditions which may be esteemed both

      honorable and advantageous to that prelate. He was not required to give up

      any rights of the church, or resign any of those pretensions which had

      been the original ground of the controversy. It was agreed that all these

      questions should be buried in oblivion; but that Becket and his adherents

      should, without making further submission, be restored to all their

      livings, and that even the possessors of such benefices as depended on the

      see of Canterbury and had been filled during the primate’s absence, should

      be expelled, and Becket have liberty to supply the vacancies.[*] In return

      for concessions which intrenched so deeply on the honor and dignity of the

      crown, Henry reaped only the advantage of seeing his ministers absolved

      from the sentence of excommunication pronounced against them, and of

      preventing the interdict, which, if these hard conditions had not been

      complied with, was ready to be laid on all his dominions.[**] It was easy

      to see how much he dreaded that event, when a prince of so high a spirit

      could submit to terms so dishonorable, in order to prevent it. So anxious

      was Henry to accommodate all differences, and to reconcile himself fully

      with Becket, that he took the most extraordinary steps to flatter his

      vanity, and even on one occasion humiliated himself so far as to hold the

      stirrup of that haughty prelate while he mounted.[***]

     

      But the king attained not even that temporary tranquillity which he had

      hoped to reap from these expedients. During the heat of his quarrel with

      Becket, while he was every day expecting an interdict to be laid on his

      kingdom, and a sentence of excommunication to be fulminated against his

      person, he had thought it prudent to have his son. Prince Henry,

      associated with him in the royalty, and to make him be crowned king, by

      the hands of Roger, archbishop of York. By this precaution, he both

      insured the succession of that prince, which, considering the many past

      irregularities in that point, could not but be esteemed somewhat

      precarious; and he preserved at least his family on the throne, if the

      sentence of excommunication should have the effect which he dreaded, and

      should make his subjects renounce their allegiance to him. Though his

      design was conducted with expedition and secrecy, Becket, before it was

      carried into execution, had got intelligence of it, and being desirous of

      obstructing all Henry’s measures, as well as anxious to prevent this

      affront to himself, who pretended to the sole right, as archbishop of

      Canterbury, to officiate in the coronation, he had inhibited all the

      prelates of England from assisting at this ceremony, had procured from the

      pope a mandate to the same purpose, and had incited the king of France to

      protest against the coronation of young Henry, unless the princess,

      daughter of that monarch, should at the same time receive the royal

      unction. There prevailed in that age an opinion which was akin to its

      other superstitions, that the royal unction was essential to the exercise

      of royal power: it was therefore natural, both for the king of France,

      careful of his daughter’s establishment and for Becket, jealous of his own

      dignity, to demand, in the treaty with Henry, some satisfaction in this

      essential point. Henry, after apologizing to Lewis for the omission with

      regard to Margaret, and excusing it on account of the secrecy and despatch

      requisite for conducting that measure, promised that the ceremony should

      be renewed in the persons both of the prince and princess; and he assured

      Becket, that besides receiving the acknowledgments of Roger and the other

      bishops for the seeming affront put on the see of Canterbury, the primate

      should, as a further satisfaction, recover his rights by officiating in

      this coronation. But the violent spirit of Becket, elated by the power of

      the church, and by the victory which he had already obtained over his

      sovereign, was not content with this voluntary compensation, but resolved

      to make the injury, which he pretended to have suffered, a handle for

      taking revenge on all his enemies. On his arrival in England, he met the

      archbishop of York and the bishops of London and Salisbury, who were on

      their journey to the king in Normandy. He notified to the archbishop the

      sentence of suspension, and to the two bishops that of excommunication,

      which, at his solicitation, the pope had pronounced against them. Reginald

      de Warrenne and Gervase de Cornhill, two of the king’s ministers, who were

      employed on their duty in Kent, asked him, on hearing of this bold attempt

      whether he meant to bring fire and sword into the kingdom. But the

      primate, heedless of the reproof, proceeded in the most ostentatious

      manner to take possession of his diocese in Rochester and all the towns

      through which he passed, he was received with the shouts and acclamations

      of the populace. As he approached Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of

      all ranks and ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated with hymns of

      joy his triumphant entrance. And though he was obliged, by order of the

      young prince, who resided at Woodstock, to return to his diocese, he found

      that he was not mistaken, when he reckoned upon the highest veneration of

      the public towards his person and his dignity. He proceeded, therefore,

      with the more courage to dart his spiritual thunders. He issued the

      sentence of excommunication against Robert de Broc and Nigel de Sackville,

      with many others, who either had assisted at the coronation of the prince,

      or been active in the late persecution of the exiled clergy. This violent

      measure, by which he, in effect, denounced war against the king himself,

      is commonly ascribed to the vindictive disposition and imperious character

      of Becket; but as this prelate was also a man of acknowledged abilities,

      we are not in his passions alone to look for the cause of his conduct,

      when he proceeded to these extremities against his enemies. His sagacity

      had led him to discover all Henry’s intentions; and he proposed, by this

      bold and unexpected assault, to prevent the execution of them.

     

      The king, from his experience of the dispositions of his people, was

      become sensible that his enterprise had been too bold, in establishing the

      constitutions of Clarendon, in defining all the branches of royal power,

      and in endeavoring to extort from the church of England, as well as from

      the pope, an express avowal of these disputed prerogatives. Conscious also

      of his own violence in attempting to break or subdue the inflexible

      primate, he was not displeased to undo that measure which had given his

      enemies such advantage against him, and he was contented that the

      controversy should terminate in that ambiguous manner, which was the

      utmost that princes, in those ages, could hope to attain in their disputes

      with the see of Rome. Though he dropped for the present the prosecution of

      Becket, he still reserved to himself the right of maintaining, that the

      constitutions of Clarendon, the original ground of the quarrel, were both

      the ancient customs and the present law of the realm; and though he knew

      that the papal clergy asserted them to be impious in themselves, as well

      as abrogated by the sentence of the sovereign pontiff, he intended, in

      spite of their clamors, steadily to put those laws in execution, and to

      trust to his own abilities, and to the course of events, for success in

      that perilous enterprise. He hoped that Becket’s experience of a six

      years’ exile would, after his pride was fully gratified by his

      restoration, be sufficient tc teach him more reserve in his opposition; or

      if any controversy arose, he expected thenceforth to engage in a more

      favorable cause, and to maintain with advantage, while the primate was now

      in his power, the ancient and undoubted customs of the kingdom against the

      usurpations of the clergy. But Becket, determined not to betray the

      ecclesiastical privileges by his connivance, and apprehensive lest a

      prince of such profound policy, if allowed to proceed in his own way,

      might probably in the end prevail, resolved to take all the advantage

      which his present victory gave him, and to disconcert the cautious

      measures of the king, by the vehemence and rigor of his own conduct.

      Assured of support from Rome, he was little intimidated by dangers which

      his courage taught him to despise, and which, even if attended with the

      most fatal consequences, would serve only to gratify his ambition and

      thirst of glory.

     

      When the suspended and excommunicated prelates arrived at Baieux, where

      the king then resided, and complained to him of the violent proceedings of

      Becket, he instantly perceived the consequences; was sensible that his

      whole plan of operations was overthrown; foresaw that the dangerous

      contest between the civil and spiritual powers, a contest which he himself

      had first roused, but which he had endeavored, by all his late

      negotiations and concessions, to appease, must come to an immediate and

      decisive issue; and he was thence thrown into the most violent commotion.

      The archbishop of York remarked to him, that so long as Becket lived, he

      could never expect to enjoy peace or tranquillity. The king himself, being

      vehemently agitated, burst forth into an exclamation against his servants,

      whose want of zeal, he said, had so long left him exposed to the

      enterprises of that ungrateful and imperious prelate. Four gentlemen of

      his household, Reginald Fitz-Urse, William de Traci, Hugh de Moreville,

      and Richard Brito, taking these passionate expressions to be a hint for

      Becket’s death, immediately communicated their thoughts to each other; and

      swearing to avenge their prince’s quarrel secretly withdrew from court.

      Some menacing expressions which they had dropped, gave a suspicion of

      their design; and the king despatched a messenger after them, charging

      them to attempt nothing against the person of the primate; but these

      orders arrived too late to prevent their fatal purpose. The four

      assassins, though they took different roads to England, arrived nearly

      about the same time at Saltwoode, near Canterbury; and being there joined

      by some assistants, they proceeded in a great haste to the archiepiscopal

      palace. They found the primate, who trusted entirely to the sacredness of

      his character, very slenderly attended; and though they threw out many

      menaces and reproaches against him, he was so incapable of fear, that,

      without using any precautions against their violence, he immediately went

      to St. Benedict’s church, to hear vespers. They followed him thither,

      attacked him before the altar, and having cloven his head with many blows,

      retired without meeting any opposition. This was the tragical end of

      Thomas Ã  Becket, a prelate of the most lofty, intrepid, and inflexible

      spirit, who was able to cover to the world, and probably to himself, the

      enterprises of pride and ambition, under the disguise of sanctity, and of

      zeal for the interests of religion; an extraordinary personage, surely,

      had he been allowed to remain in his first station, and had directed the

      vehemence of his character to the support of law and justice; instead of

      being engaged, by the prejudices of the times, to sacrifice all private

      duties and public connections to ties which he imagined, or represented,

      as superior to every civil and political consideration. But no man, who

      enters into the genius of that age, can reasonably doubt of this prelate’s

      sincerity. The spirit of superstition was so prevalent, that it infallibly

      caught every careless reasoner, much more every one whose interest, and

      honor, and ambition were engaged to support it. All the wretched

      literature of the times was enlisted on that side. Some faint glimmerings

      of common sense might sometimes pierce through the thick cloud of

      ignorance, or, what was worse, the illusions of perverted science, which

      had blotted out the sun, and enveloped the face of nature; but those who

      preserved themselves untainted by the general contagion, proceeded on no

      principles which they could pretend to justify; they were more indebted to

      their total want of instruction than to their knowledge, if they still

      retained some share of understanding; folly was possessed of all the

      schools as well as all the churches; and her votaries assumed the garb of

      philosophers, together with the ensigns of spiritual dignities. Throughout

      that large collection of letters which bears the name of St. Thomas, we

      find, in all the retainers of that aspiring prelate, no less than in

      himself, a most entire and absolute conviction of the reason and piety of

      their own party, and a disdain of their antagonists; nor is there less

      cant and grimace in their style, when they address each other, than when

      they compose manifestoes for the perusal of the public. The spirit of

      revenge, violence, and ambition which accompanied their conduct, instead

      of forming a presumption of hypocrisy, are the surest pledges of their

      sincere attachment to a cause which so much flattered these domineering

      passions.

     

      Henry, on the first report of Becket’s violent measures, had purposed to

      have him arrested, and had already taken some steps towards the execution

      of that design; but the intelligence of his murder threw the prince into

      great consternation; and he was immediately sensible of the dangerous

      consequences which he had reason to apprehend from so unexpected an event.

      An archbishop of reputed sanctity assassinated before the altar, in the

      exercise of his functions, and on account of his zeal in maintaining

      ecclesiastical privileges, must attain the highest honors of martyrdom;

      while his murderer would be ranked among the most bloody tyrants that ever

      were exposed to the hatred and detestation of mankind. Interdicts and

      excommunications, weapons in themselves so terrible, would, he foresaw, be

      armed with double force, when employed in a cause so much calculated to

      work on the human passions, and so peculiarly adapted to the eloquence of

      popular preachers and declaimers. In vain would he plead his own

      innocence, and even his total ignorance of the fact; he was sufficiently

      guilty, if the church thought proper to esteem him such; and his

      concurrence in Becket’s martyrdom, becoming a religious opinion, would be

      received with all the implicit credit which belonged to the most

      established articles of faith. These considerations gave the king the most

      unaffected concern; and as it was extremely his interest to clear himself

      from all suspicion, he took no care to conceal the depth of his

      affliction. He shut himself up from the light of day, and from all

      commerce with his servants; he even refused, during three days, all food

      and sustenance; the courtiers, apprehending dangerous effects from his

      despair were at last obliged to break in upon his solitude; and they

      employed every topic of consolation, induced him to accept of nourishment,

      and occupied his leisure in taking precautions against the consequences

      which he so justly apprehended from the murder of the primate.

     

      1171.

     

      The point of chief importance to Henry was to convince the pope of his

      innocence; or rather, to persuade him that he would reap greater

      advantages from the submissions of England than from proceeding to

      extremities against that kingdom. The archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of

      Worcester and Evreux, with five persons of inferior quality, were

      immediately despatched to Rome, and orders were given them to perform

      their journey with the utmost expedition. Though the name and authority of

      the court of Rome were so terrible in the remote countries of Europe,

      which were sunk in profound ignorance, and were entirely unacquainted with

      its character and conduct, the pope was so little revered at home, that

      his inveterate enemies surrounded the gates of Rome itself, and even

      controlled his government in that city; and the ambassadors, who, from a

      distant extremity of Europe, carried to him the humble, or rather abject

      submissions of the greatest potentate of the age, found the utmost

      difficulty to make their way to him and to throw themselves at his feet.

      It was at length agreed that Richard Barre, one of their number, should

      leave the rest behind, and run all the hazards of the passage, in order to

      prevent the fatal consequences which might ensue from any delay in giving

      satisfaction to his holiness. He found, on his arrival, that Alexander was

      already wrought up to the greatest rage against the king, that Becket’s

      partisans were daily stimulating him to revenge, that the king of France

      had exhorted him to fulminate the most dreadful sentence against England,

      and that the very mention of Henry’s name before the sacred college, was

      received with every expression of horror and execration.

     

      The Thursday before Easter was now approaching, when it is customary for

      the pope to denounce annual curses against all his enemies; and it was

      expected that Henry should, with all the preparations peculiar to the

      discharge of that sacred artillery, be solemnly comprehended in the

      number. But Barre found means to appease the pontiff, and to deter him

      from a measure which, if it failed of success, could not afterwards be

      easily recalled: the anathemas were only levelled in general against all

      the actors, accomplices and abettors of Becket’s murder. The abbot of

      Valasse, and the archdeacons of Salisbury and Lisieux, with others of

      Henry’s ministers, who soon after arrived, besides asserting their

      prince’s innocence, made oath before the whole consistory, that he would

      stand to the pope’s judgment in the affair, and make every submission that

      should be required of him. The terrible blow was thus artfully eluded; the

      cardinals Albert and Theodin were appointed legates to examine the cause,

      and were ordered to proceed to Normandy for that purpose; and though

      Henry’s foreign dominions were already laid under an interdict by the

      archbishop of Sens, Becket’s great partisan, and the pope’s legate in

      France, the general expectation that the monarch would easily exculpate

      himself from any concurrence in the guilt, kept every one in suspense, and

      prevented all the bad consequences which might be dreaded from that

      sentence.

     

      The clergy, meanwhile, though their rage was happily diverted from falling

      on the king, were not idle in magnifying the sanctity of Becket, in

      extolling the merits of his martyrdom, and in exalting him above all that

      devoted tribe who, in several ages, had, by their blood, cemented the

      fabric of the temple. Other saints had only borne testimony by their

      sufferings to the general doctrines of Christianity; but Becket had

      sacrificed his life to the power and privileges of the clergy; and this

      peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a suitable acknowledgment to

      his memory. Endless were the panegyrics on his virtues; and the miracles

      wrought by his relics were more numerous, more nonsensical, and more

      impudently attested than those which ever filled the legend of any

      confessor or martyr. Two years after his death, he was canonized by Pope

      Alexander; a solemn jubilee was established for celebrating his merits;

      his body was removed to a magnificent shrine, enriched with presents from

      all parts of Christendom; pilgrimages were performed to obtain his

      intercession with Heaven, and it was computed, that in one year above a

      hundred thousand pilgrims arrived in Canterbury, and paid their devotions

      at his tomb. It is indeed a mortifying reflection to those who are

      actuated by the love of fame, so justly denominated the last infirmity of

      noble minds, that the wisest legislator and most exalted genius that ever

      reformed or enlightened the world, can never expect such tributes of

      praise an are lavished on the memory of pretended saints, whose whole

      conduct was probably to the last degree odious or contemptible, and whose

      industry was entirely directed to the pursuit of objects pernicious to

      mankind. It is only a conqueror, a personage no less entitled to our

      hatred, who can pretend to the attainment of equal renown and glory.

     

      It may not be amiss to remark, before we conclude this subject of Thomas Ã 

      Becket, that the king, during his controversy with that prelate, was on

      every occasion more anxious than usual to express his zeal for religion,

      and to avoid all appearance of a profane negligence on that head. He gave

      his consent to the imposing of a tax on all his dominions, for the

      delivery of the Holy Land, now threatened by the famous Salad me: this tax

      amounted to twopence a pound for one year, and a penny a pound for the

      four subsequent.[*] Almost all the princes of Europe laid a like

      imposition on their subjects, which received the name of Saladine’s tax.

      During this period there came over from Germany about thirty heretics of

      both sexes, under the direction of one Gerard, simple, ignorant people,

      who could give no account of their faith, but declared themselves ready to

      suffer for the tenets of their master. They made only one convert in

      England, a woman as ignorant as themselves; yet they gave such umbrage to

      the clergy, that they were delivered over to the secular arm, and were

      punished by being burned on the forehead, and then whipped through the

      streets. They seemed to exult in their sufferings, and as they went along

      sung the beatitude, “Blessed are ye, when men hate you and persecute

      you.”[**]

     

      After they were whipped, they were thrust out almost naked in the midst of

      winter, and perished through cold and hunger; no one daring, or being

      willing, to give them the least relief. We are ignorant of the particular

      tenets of these people; for it would be imprudent to rely on the

      representations left of them by the clergy, who affirm, that they denied

      the efficacy of the sacraments and the unity of the church. It is probable

      that their departure from the standard of orthodoxy was still more subtile

      and minute. They seem to have been the first that ever suffered for heresy

      in England.

     

      As soon as Henry found that he was in no immediate danger from the

      thunders of the Vatican, he undertook an expedition against Ireland; a

      design which he had long projected, and by which he hoped to recover his

      credit, somewhat impaired by his late transactions with the hierarchy
