IN the progress and settlement of the feudal law, the male succession to

      fiefs had taken place some time before the female was admitted; and

      estates, being considered as military benefices, not as property, were

      transmitted to such only as could serve in the armies, and perform in

      person the conditions upon which they were originally granted. But when

      the continuance of rights, during some generations, in the same family,

      had, in a great measure, obliterated the primitive idea, the females were

      gradually admitted to the possession of feudal property; and the same

      revolution of principles which procured them the inheritance of private

      estates, naturally introduced their succession to government and

      authority. The failure, therefore, of male heirs to the kingdom of England

      and duchy of Normandy, seemed to leave the succession open, without a

      rival, to the empress Matilda; and as Henry had made all his vassals in

      both states swear fealty to her, he presumed that they would not easily be

      induced to depart at once from her hereditary right, and from their own

      reiterated oaths and engagements. But the irregular manner in which he

      himself had acquired the crown might have instructed him, that neither his

      Norman nor English subjects were as yet capable of adhering to a strict

      rule of government; and as every precedent of this kind seems to give

      authority to new usurpations, he had reason to dread, even from his own

      family, some invasion of his daughter’s title, which he had taken such

      pains to establish.

     

      Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror, had been married to Stephen,

      count of Blois, and had brought him several sons; among whom Stephen and

      Henry, the two youngest, had been invited over to England by the late king

      and had received great honors, riches, and preferment, from the zealous

      friendship which that prince bore to every one that had been so fortunate

      as to acquire his favor and good opinion. Henry, who had betaken himself

      to the ecclesiastical profession, was created abbot of Glastonbury and

      bishop of Winchester; and though these dignities were considerable,

      Stephen had, from his uncle’s liberality, attained establishments still

      more solid and durable.[*] The king had married him to Matilda, who was

      daughter and heir of Eustace, count of Boulogne, and who brought him,

      besides that feudal sovereignty in France, an immense property in England,

      which, in the distribution of lands, had been conferred by the Conqueror

      on the family of Boulogne. Stephen also by this marriage acquired a new

      connection with the royal family of England, as Mary, his wife’s mother,

      was sister to David, the reigning king of Scotland, and to Matilda, the

      first wife of Henry, and mother of the empress. The king, still imagining

      that he strengthened the interests of his family by the aggrandizement of

      Stephen, took pleasure in enriching him by the grant of new possessions;

      and he conferred on him the great estate forfeited by Robert Mallet in

      England, and that forfeited by the earl of Mortaigne in Normandy. Stephen,

      in return, professed great attachment to his uncle, and appeared so

      zealous for the succession of Matilda, that, when the barons swore fealty

      to that princess, he contended with Robert, earl of Glocester, the king’s

      natural son, who should first be admitted to give her this testimony of

      devoted zeal and fidelity.[**] Meanwhile he continued to cultivate, by

      every art of popularity, the friendship of the English nation; and many

      virtues with which he seemed to be endowed, favored the success of his

      intentions. By his bravery, activity, and vigor, he acquired the esteem of

      the barons; by his generosity, and by an affable and familiar address,

      unusual in that age among men of his high quality, he obtained the

      affections of the people, particularly of the Londoners.[***] And though

      he dared not to take any steps towards his further grandeur, lest he

      should expose himself to the jealousy of so penetrating a prince as Henry,

      he still hoped that, by accumulating riches and power, and by acquiring

      popularity, he might in time be able to open his way to the throne.

     

      No sooner had Henry breathed his last, than Stephen, insensible to all the

      ties of gratitude and fidelity, and blind to danger, gave full reins to

      his criminal ambition; and trusted that, even without any previous

      intrigue, the celerity of his enterprise, and the boldness of his attempt,

      might overcome the weak attachment which the English and Normans in that

      age bore to the laws and to the rights of their sovereign. He hastened

      over to England, and though the citizens of Dover and those of Canterbury,

      apprised of his purpose, shut their gates against him, he stopped not till

      he arrived at London, where some of the lower rank, instigated by his

      emissaries, as well as moved by his general popularity, immediately

      saluted him king. His next point was to acquire the good will of the

      clergy; and by performing the ceremony of his coronation, to put himself

      in possession of the throne, from which he was confident it would not be

      easy afterwards to expel him. His brother, the bishop of Winchester, was

      useful to him in these capital articles; having gained Roger, bishop of

      Salisbury, who, though he owed a great fortune and advancement to the

      favor of the late king, preserved no sense of gratitude to that prince’s

      family, he applied, in conjunction with that prelate, to William,

      archbishop of Canterbury, and required him, in virtue of his office, to

      give the royal unction to Stephen. The primate, who, as all the others,

      had sworn fealty to Matilda, refused to perform this ceremony; but his

      opposition was overcome by an expedient equally dishonorable with the

      other steps by which this revolution was effected. Hugh Bigod, steward of

      the household, made oath before the primate, that the late king, on his

      death-bed, had shown a dissatisfaction with his daughter Matilda, and had

      expressed his intention of leaving the count of Boulogne heir to all his

      dominions.[*] William, either believing or feigning to believe Bigod’s

      testimony, anointed Stephen, and put the crown upon his head; and from

      this religious ceremony, that prince, without any shadow, either of

      hereditary title or consent of the nobility or people, was allowed to

      proceed to the exercise of sovereign authority. Very few barons attended

      his coronation;[**] but none opposed his usurpation, however unjust or

      flagrant.

     

      The sentiment of religion which, if corrupted into superstition, has often

      little efficacy in fortifying the duties of civil society, was not

      affected by the multiplied oaths taken in favor of Matilda, and only

      rendered the people obedient to a prince who was countenanced by the

      clergy, and who had received from the primate the rite of royal unction

      and consecration.[*]

     

      Stephen, that he might further secure his tottering throne passed a

      charter, in which he made liberal promises to all orders of men; to the

      clergy, that he would speedily fill all vacant benefices, and would never

      levy the rents of any of them during the vacancy; to the nobility, that he

      would reduce the royal forests to their ancient boundaries, and correct

      all encroachments; and to the people, that he would remit the tax of

      danegelt, and restore the laws of King Edward.[**] The late king had a

      great treasure at Winchester, amounting to a hundred thousand pounds; and

      Stephen, by seizing this money, immediately turned against Henry’s family

      the precaution which that prince had employed for their grandeur and

      security; an event which naturally attends the policy of amassing

      treasures. By means of this money, the usurper insured the compliance,

      though not the attachment, of the principal clergy and nobility; but not

      trusting to this frail security, he invited over from the continent,

      particularly from Brittany and Flanders, great numbers of those bravoes,

      or disorderly soldiers, with whom every country in Europe, by reason of

      the general ill police and turbulent government, extremely abounded.[***]

      These mercenary troops guarded his throne by the terrors of the sword; and

      Stephen, that he might also overawe all malecontents by new and additional

      terrors of religion, procured a bull from Rome, which ratified his title,

      and which the pope, seeing this prince in possession of the throne, and

      pleased with an appeal to his authority in secular controversies, very

      readily granted him.[****]

     

      1136.

     

      Matilda and her husband Geoffrey were as unfortunate in Normandy as they

      had been in England. The Norman nobility, moved by an hereditary animosity

      against the Angevins, first applied to Theobold, count of Blois, Stephen’s

      elder brother for protection and assistance; but hearing afterwards that

      Stephen had got possession of the English crown, and having, many of them,

      the same reasons as formerly for desiring a continuance of their union

      with that kingdom, they transferred their allegiance to Stephen, and put

      him in possession of their government. Lewis the younger, the reigning

      king of France, accepted the homage of Eustace, Stephen’s eldest son, for

      the duchy; and the more to corroborate his connections with that family,

      he betrothed his sister Constantia to the young prince. The count of Blois

      assigned all his pretensions, and received in lieu of them an annual

      pension of two thousand marks; and Geoffrey himself was obliged to

      conclude a truce for two years with Stephen, on condition of the king’s

      paying him, during that time, a pension of five thousand.[*] Stephen, who

      had taken a journey to Normandy, finished all these transactions in

      person, and soon after returned to England.

     

      Robert, earl of Glocester, natural son of the late king, was a man of

      honor and abilities; and as he was much attached to the interests of his

      sister Matilda, and zealous for the lineal succession, it was chiefly from

      his intrigues and resistance that the king had reason to dread a new

      revolution of government. This nobleman, who was in Normandy when he

      received intelligence of Stephen’s accession, found himself much

      embarrassed concerning the measures which he should pursue in that

      difficult emergency. To swear allegiance to the usurper appeared to him

      dishonorable, and a breach of his oath to Matilda: to refuse giving this

      pledge of his fidelity was to banish himself from England, and be totally

      incapacitated from serving the royal family, or contributing to their

      restoration.[**] He offered Stephen to do him homage, and to take the oath

      of fealty; but with an express condition, that the king should maintain

      all his stipulations, and should never invade any of Robert’s rights or

      dignities; and Stephen, though sensible that this reserve, so unusual in

      itself, and so unbefitting the duty of a subject, was meant only to afford

      Robert a pretence for a revolt on the first favorable opportunity, was

      obliged by the numerous friends and retainers of that nobleman, to receive

      him on those terms.[***]

     

      The clergy, who could scarcely at this time be deemed subjects to the

      crown, imitated that dangerous example: they annexed to their oaths of

      allegiance this condition, that they were only bound so long as the king

      defended the ecclesiastical liberties, and supported the discipline of the

      church.[*] The barons, in return for their submission, exacted terms still

      more destructive of public peace, as well as of royal authority. Many of

      them required the right of fortifying their castles, and of putting

      themselves in a posture of defence; and the king found himself totally

      unable to refuse his consent to this exorbitant demand.[**] All England

      was immediately filled with those fortresses, which the noblemen

      garrisoned either with their vassals, or with licentious soldiers, who

      flocked to them from all quarters. Unbounded rapine was exercised upon the

      people for the maintenance of these troops; and private animosities, which

      had with difficulty been restrained by law, now breaking out without

      control, rendered England a scene of uninterrupted violence and

      devastation. Wars between the nobles were carried on with the utmost fury

      in every quarter; the barons even assumed the right of coining money, and

      of exercising, without appeal, every act of jurisdiction; [***] and the

      inferior gentry, as well as the people, finding no defence from the laws

      during this total dissolution of sovereign authority, were obliged, for

      their immediate safety, to pay court to some neighboring chieftain, and to

      purchase his protection, both by submitting to his exactions, and by

      assisting him in his rapine upon others. The erection of one castle proved

      the immediate cause of building many others; and even those who obtained

      not the king’s permission, thought that they were entitled, by the great

      principle of self-preservation, to put themselves on an equal footing with

      their neighbors, who commonly were also their enemies and rivals. The

      aristocratical power, which is usually so oppressive in the Feudal

      governments, had now risen to its utmost height, during the reign of a

      prince who, though endowed with vigor and abilities, had usurped the

      throne without the pretence of a title, and who was necessitated to

      tolerate in others the same violence to which he himself had been holden

      for his sovereignty.

     

      But Stephen was not of a disposition to submit long to these usurpations,

      without making some effort for the recovery of royal authority. Finding

      that the legal prerogatives of the crown were resisted and abridged, he

      was also tempted to make his power the sole measure of his conduct, and to

      violate all those concessions which he himself had made on his

      accession,[*] as well as the ancient privileges of his subjects. The

      mercenary soldiers, who chiefly supported his authority, having exhausted

      the royal treasure, subsisted by depredations; and every place was filled

      with the best grounded complaints against the government. The earl of

      Glocester, having now settled with his friends the plan of an

      insurrection, retired beyond sea, sent the king a defiance, solemnly

      renounced his allegiance, and upbraided him with the breach of those

      conditions which had been annexed to the oath of fealty sworn by that

      nobleman.[**]

     

      1137.

     

      David, king of Scotland, appeared at the head of an army in defence of his

      niece’s title, and penetrating into Yorkshire, committed the most

      barbarous devastations on that country.

     

      1138.

     

      The fury of his massacres and ravages enraged the northern nobility, who

      might otherwise have been inclined to join him; and William, earl of

      Albemarle, Robert de Ferrers, William Piercy, Robert de Brus, Roger

      Moubray, Ilbert Lacy, Walter l’Espee, powerful barons in those parts,

      assembled an army, with which they encamped at North Allerton, and awaited

      the arrival of the enemy. A great battle was here fought, called the

      battle of the Standard, from a high crucifix, erected by the English on a

      wagon, and carried along with the army as a military ensign. The king of

      Scots was defeated; and he himself, as well as his son Henry, narrowly

      escaped falling into the hands of the English. This success overawed the

      malecontents in England, and might have given some stability to Stephen’s

      throne, had he not been so elated with prosperity as to engage in a

      controversy with the clergy, who were at that time an overmatch for any

      monarch.

     

      Though the great power of the church, in ancient times, weakened the

      authority of the crown, and interrupted the course of the laws, it may be

      doubted whether, in ages of such violence and outrage, it was not rather

      advantageous that some limits were set to the power of the sword, both in

      the hands of the prince and nobles, and that men were taught to pay regard

      to some principles and privileges.

     

      1139.

     

      The chief misfortune was, that the prelates, on some occasions, acted

      entirely as barons, employed military power against their sovereign or

      their neighbors, and thereby often increased those disorders which it was

      their duty to repress. The bishop of Salisbury, in imitation of the

      nobility, had built two strong castles, one at Sherborne, another at the

      Devizes, and had laid the foundations of a third at Malmsbury: his nephew;

      Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, had erected a fortress at Newark; and

      Stephen, who was now sensible from experience of the mischiefs attending

      these multiplied; citadels, resolved to begin with destroying those of the

      clergy, who by their function seemed less entitled than the barons to such

      military securities.[*] Making pretence of a fray, which had arisen in

      court between the retinue of the bishop of Salisbury and that of the earl

      of Brittany, he seized both that prelate and the bishop of Lincoln, threw

      them into prison, and obliged them by menaces to deliver up those places

      of strength which they had lately erected.[**]

     

      Henry, bishop of Winchester, the king’s brother, being armed with a

      legantine commission, now conceived himself to be an ecclesiastical

      sovereign no less powerful than the civil; and forgetting the ties of

      blood which connected him with the king, he resolved to vindicate the

      clerical privileges which, he pretended, were here openly violated. He

      assembled a synod at Westminster, and there complained of the impiety of

      Stephen’s measures, who had employed violence against the dignitaries of

      the church, and had not awaited the sentence of a spiritual court, by

      which alone, he affirmed, they could lawfully be tried and condemned, if

      their conduct had anywise merited censure or punishment.[***] The synod,

      ventured to send a summons to the king, charging him to appear before

      them, and to justify his measures;[****] and Stephen, instead of resenting

      this indignity, sent Aubrey de Vere to plead his cause before that

      assembly. De Vere accused; the two prelates of treason and sedition; but

      the synod refused, to try the cause, or examine their conduct, till those

      castles of which they had been dispossessed, were previously restored to

      them.[*****] The bishop of Salisbury declared, that he would appeal to the

      pope; and had not Stephen and his partisans employed menaces, and even

      shown a disposition of executing violence by the hands of the soldiery,

      affairs had instantly come to extremity between the crown and the

      mitre.[******]

     

      While this quarrel, joined to so many other grievances, increased the

      discontents among the people, the empress, invited by the opportunity, and

      secretly encouraged by the legate himself, landed in England, with Robert,

      earl of Glocester, and a retinue of a hundred and forty knights. She fixed

      her residence at Arundel Castle, whose gates were opened to her by

      Adelais, the queen dowager, now married to William de Albini, earl of

      Sussex; and she excited, by messengers, her partisans to take arms in

      every county of England. Adelais, who had expected that her

      daughter-in-law would have invaded the kingdom with a much greater force,

      became apprehensive of danger; and Matilda, to ease her of her fears,

      removed first to Bristol, which belonged to her brother Robert, thence to

      Glocester, where she remained under the protection of Milo, a gallant

      nobleman in those parts, who had embraced her cause. Soon after, Geoffrey

      Talbot, William Mohun, Ralph Lovell, William Fitz-John, William Fitz-Alan,

      Paganell, and many other barons, declared for her; and her party, which

      was generally favored in the kingdom, seemed every day to gain ground upon

      that of her antagonist.

     

      Were we to relate all the military events transmitted to us by

      contemporary and authentic historians, it would be easy to swell our

      accounts of this reign into a large volume; but those incidents, so little

      memorable in themselves, and so confused both in time and place, could

      afford neither instruction nor entertainment to the reader. It suffices to

      say, that the war was spread into every quarter; and that those turbulent

      barons, who had already shaken off, in a great measure, the restraint of

      government, having now obtained the pretence of a public cause, carried on

      their devastations with redoubled fury, exercised implacable vengeance on

      each other, and set no bounds to their oppressions over the people. The

      castles of the nobility were become receptacles of licensed robbers, who,

      sallying forth day and night, committed spoil on the open country, on the

      villages, and even on the cities; put the captives to torture, in order to

      make them reveal their treasures; sold their persons to slavery; and set

      fire to their houses, after they had pillaged them of every thing

      valuable. The fierceness of their disposition, leading them to commit

      wanton destruction, frustrated their rapacity of its purpose; and the

      property and persons even of the ecclesiastics, generally so much revered,

      were at last, from necessity, exposed to the same outrage which had laid

      waste the rest of the kingdom. The land was left untilled; the instruments

      of husbandry were destroyed or abandoned; and a grievous famine, the

      natural result of those disorders, affected equally both parties, and

      reduced the spoilers, as well as the defenceless people, to the most

      extreme want and indigence.[*]

     

      1140.

     

      After several fruitless negotiations and treaties of peace, which never

      interrupted these destructive hostilities, there happened at last an event

      which seemed to promise some end of the public calamities. Ralph, earl of

      Chester, and his half-brother, William de Roumara, partisans of Matilda,

      had surprised the Castle of Lincoln; but the citizens, who were better

      affected to Stephen, having invited him to their aid, that prince laid

      close siege to the castle, in hopes of soon rendering himself master of

      the place, either by assault or by famine. The earl of Glocester hastened

      with an army to the relief of his friends; and Stephen, informed of his

      approach, took the field with a resolution of giving him battle.

     

      1141.

     

      After a violent shock, the two wings of the royalists were put to flight;

      and Stephen himself, surrounded by the enemy, was at last, after exerting

      great efforts of valor, borne down by numbers and taken prisoner. He was

      conducted to Glocester; and though at first treated with humanity, was

      soon after, on some suspicion, thrown into prison, and loaded with irons.

     

      Stephen’s party was entirely broken by the captivity of their leader, and

      the barons came in daily from all quarters, and did homage to Matilda. The

      princess, however, amidst all her prosperity, knew that she was not secure

      of success, unless she could gain the confidence of the clergy; and as the

      conduct of the legate had been of late very ambiguous, and showed his

      intentions to have rather aimed at humbling his brother, than totally

      ruining him, she employed every endeavor to fix him in her interests. She

      held a conference with him in an open plain near Winchester; where she

      promised upon oath, that if he would acknowledge her for sovereign, would

      recognize her title as the sole descendant of the late king, and would

      again submit to the allegiance which he, as well as the rest of the

      kingdom, had sworn to her, he should in return be entire master of the

      administration, and in particular should, at his pleasure, dispose of all

      vacant bishoprics and abbeys. Earl Robert, her brother, Brian Fitz-Count,

      Milo of Glocester, and other great men, became guaranties for her

      observing these engagements;[*] and the prelate was at last induced to

      promise her allegiance, but that still burdened with the express

      condition, that she should on her part fulfil her promises. He then

      conducted her to Winchester, led her in procession to the cathedral, and

      with great solemnity, in the presence of many bishops and abbots,

      denounced curses against all those who cursed her, poured out blessings on

      those who blessed her granted absolution to such as were obedient to her,

      and excommunicated such as were rebellious.[**] Theobald, archbishop of

      Canterbury, soon after came also to court, and swore allegiance to the

      empress.[***]

     

      Matilda, that she might further insure the attachment of the clergy, was

      willing to receive the crown from their hands; and instead of assembling

      the states of the kingdom, the measure which the constitution, had it been

      either fixed or regarded, seemed necessarily to require, she was content

      that the legate should summon an ecclesiastical synod, and that her title

      to the throne should there be acknowledged. The legate, addressing himself

      to the assembly, told them, that in the absence of the empress, Stephen,

      his brother, had been permitted to reign, and, previously to his ascending

      the throne, had seduced them by many fair promises, of honoring and

      exalting the church, of maintaining the laws, and of reforming all abuses;

      that it grieved him to observe how much that prince had in every

      particular been wanting to his engagements; public peace was interrupted,

      crimes were daily committed with impunity, bishops were thrown into prison

      and forced to surrender their possessions, abbeys were put to sale,

      churches were pillaged and the most enormous disorders prevailed in the

      administration; that he himself, in order to procure a redress of these

      grievances, had formerly summoned the king before a council of bishops;

      but instead of inducing him to amend his conduct, had rather offended him

      by that expedient; that, how much soever misguided, that prince was still

      his brother, and the object of his affections; but his interests, however,

      must be regarded as subordinate to those of their heavenly Father, who had

      now rejected him, and thrown him into the hands of his enemies; that it

      principally belonged to the clergy to elect and ordain kings; he had

      summoned them together for that purpose; and having invoked the divine

      assistance, he now pronounced Matilda, the only descendant of Henry, their

      late sovereign, queen of England. The whole assembly, by their

      acclamations or silence, gave or seemed to give, their assent to this

      declaration.[*]

     

      The only laymen summoned to this council, which decided the fate of the

      crown, were the Londoners; and even these were required not to give their

      opinion, but to submit to the decrees of the synod. The deputies of

      London, however, were not so passive; they insisted that their king should

      be delivered from prison; but were told by the legate, that it became not

      the Londoners, who were regarded as noblemen in England, to take part with

      those barons who had basely forsaken their lord in battle, and who had

      treated holy church with contumely. It is with reason that the citizens of

      London assumed so much authority, if it be true, what is related by

      Fitz-Stephen, a contemporary author, that that city should at this time

      bring into the field no less than eighty thousand combatants.[**]

     

      London, notwithstanding its great power, and its attachment to Stephen,

      was at length obliged to submit to Matilda; and her authority, by the

      prudent conduct of Earl Robert, seemed to be established over the whole

      kingdom; but affairs remained not long in this situation. That princess,

      besides the disadvantages of her sex, which weakened her influence over a

      turbulent and martial people, was of a passionate, imperious spirit, and

      knew not how to temper with affability the harshness of a refusal.

      Stephen’s queen, seconded by many of the nobility, petitioned for the

      liberty of her husband; and offered, that, on this condition, he should

      renounce the crown, and retire into a convent. The legate desired that

      Prince Eustace, his nephew, might inherit Boulogne and the other

      patrimonial estates of his father.[*] The Londoners applied for the

      establishment of King Edward’s laws, instead of those of King Henry,

      which, they said, were grievous and oppressive.[**] All these petitions

      were rejected in the most haughty and peremptory manner.

     

      The legate, who had probably never been sincere in his compliance with

      Matilda’s government, availed himself of the ill humor excited by this

      imperious conduct, and secretly instigated the Londoners to a revolt. A

      conspiracy was entered into to seize the person of the empress, and she

      saved herself from the danger by a precipitate retreat. She fled to

      Oxford: soon after she went to Winchester, whither the legate, desirous to

      save appearances, and watching the opportunity to ruin her cause, had

      retired. But having assembled all his retainers, he openly joined his

      force to that of the Londoners, and to Stephen’s mercenary troops, who had

      not yet evacuated the kingdom; and he besieged Matilda in Winchester. The

      princess, being hard pressed by famine, made her escape; but in the

      flight, Earl Robert, her brother, fell into the hands of the enemy. This

      nobleman, though a subject, was as much the life and soul of his own

      party, as Stephen was of the other: and the empress, sensible of his merit

      and importance, consented to exchange the prisoners on equal terms. The

      civil war was again kindled with greater fury than ever.

     

      1142.

     

      Earl Robert, finding the successes on both sides nearly balanced, went

      over to Normandy, which, during Stephen’s captivity, had submitted to the

      earl of Anjou; and he persuaded Geoffrey to allow his eldest son, Henry, a

      young prince of great hopes, to take a journey into England, and appear at

      the head of his partisans.

     

      1143.

     

      This expedient, however, produced nothing decisive. Stephen took Oxford

      after a long siege: he was defeated by Earl Robert at Wilton; and the

      empress, though of a masculine spirit, yet being harassed with a variety

      of good and bad fortune, and alarmed with continual dangers to her person

      and family, at last retired into Normandy,

     

      1146.

     

      whither she had sent her son some time before. The death of her brother,

      which happened nearly about the same time, would have proved fatal to her

      interests, hail not some incidents occurred which checked the course of

      Stephen’s prosperity. This prince, finding that the castles built by the

      noblemen of his own party encouraged the spirit of independence, and were

      little less dangerous than those which remained in the hands of the enemy,

      endeavored to extort from them a surrender of those fortresses and he

      alienated the affections of many of them by this equitable demand. The

      artillery, also, of the church, which his brother had brought over to his

      side, had, after some interval, joined the other party. Eugenius III. had

      mounted the papal throne; the bishop of Winchester was deprived of the

      legantine commission, which was conferred on Theobald, archbishop of

      Canterbury, the enemy and rival of the former legate. That pontiff, also,

      having summoned a general council at Rheims, in Champagne, instead of

      allowing the church of England, as had been usual, to elect its own

      deputies, nominated five English bishops to represent that church, and

      required their attendance in the council. Stephen, who, notwithstanding

      his present difficulties, was jealous of the rights of his crown, refused

      them permission to attend;[*] and the pope, sensible of his advantage in

      contending with a prince who reigned by a disputed title, took revenge by

      laying all Stephen’s party under an interdict.[**]

     

      1147.

     

      The discontents of the royalists at being thrown into this situation, were

      augmented by a comparison with Matilda’s party, who enjoyed all the

      benefits of the sacred ordinances; and Stephen was at last obliged, by

      making proper submissions to the see of Rome, to remove the reproach from

      his party.[***]

     

      1148.

     

      The weakness of both sides, rather than any decrease of mutual animosity,

      having produced a tacit cessation of arms in England, many of the

      nobility, Roger de Moubray, William de Warrenne, and others, finding no

      opportunity to exert their military ardor at home, enlisted themselves in

      a new crusade, which, with surprising success after former disappointments

      and misfortunes, was now preached by St. Barnard.[****] But an event soon

      after happened which threatened a revival of hostilities in England.

      Prince Henry, who had reached his sixteenth year, was desirous of

      receiving the honor of knighthood; a ceremony which every gentleman in

      that age passed through before he was admitted to the use of arms, and

      which was even deemed requisite for the greatest princes.

     

      He intended to receive his admission from his great-uncle, David, king of

      Scotland; and for that purpose he passed through England with a great

      retinue, and was attended by the most considerable of his partisans. He

      remained some time with the king of Scotland, made incursions into

      England, and by his dexterity and vigor in all manly exercises, by his

      valor in war, and his prudent conduct in every occurrence, he roused the

      hopes of his party, and gave symptoms of those great qualities which he

      afterwards displayed when he mounted the throne of England.

     

      1150.

     

      Soon after his return to Normandy, he was, by Matilda’s consent, invested

      in that duchy, and upon the death of his father Geoffrey, which happened

      in the subsequent year, he took possession both of Anjou and Maine, and

      concluded a marriage which brought him a great accession of power, and

      rendered him extremely formidable to his rival. Eleanor, the daughter and

      heir of William, duke of Guienne, and earl of Poictou, had been married

      sixteen years to Lewis VII., king of France, and had attended him in a

      crusade which that monarch conducted against the infidels; but having

      there lost the affections of her husband, and even fallen under some

      suspicion of gallantry with a handsome Saracen, Lewis, more delicate than

      politic, procured a divorce from her, and restored her those rich

      provinces, which, by her marriage, she had annexed to the crown of France.

      Young Henry, neither discouraged by the inequality of years, nor by the

      reports of Eleanor’s gallantries, made successful courtship to that

      princess, and espousing her six weeks after her divorce, got possession of

      all her dominions as her dowry.

     

      1152.

     

      The lustre which he received from this acquisition, and the prospect of

      his rising fortune, had such an elect in England, that when Stephen,

      desirous to insure the crown to his son Eustace, required the archbishop

      of Canterbury to anoint that prince as his successor, the primate refused

      compliance, and made his escape beyond sea, to avoid the violence and

      resentment of Stephen.

     

      1153.

     

      Henry, informed of these dispositions in the people, made an invasion on

      England: having gained some advantage over Stephen at Malmsbury, and

      having taken that place, he proceeded thence to throw succors into

      Wallingford, which the king had advanced with a superior army to besiege.

      A decisive action was every day expected, when the great men of both

      sides, terrified at the prospect of further bloodshed and confusion,

      interposed with their good offices, and set on foot a negotiation between

      the rival princes, The death of Eustace, during the course of the treaty,

      facilitated its conclusion: an accommodation was settled, by which it was

      agreed that Stephen should possess the crown during his lifetime, that

      justice should be administered in his name, even in the provinces which

      had submitted to Henry, and that this latter prince should, on Stephen’s

      demise, succeed to the kingdom, and William, Stephen’s son, to Boulogne

      and his patrimonial estate. After all the barons had sworn to the

      observance of this treaty, and done homage to Henry, as to the heir of the

      crown, that prince evacuated the kingdom; and the death of Stephen which

      happened next year, [October 25, 1154,] after a short illness, prevented

      all those quarrels and jealousies which were likely to have ensued in so

      delicate a situation.

     

      England suffered great miseries during the reign of this prince: but his

      personal character, allowing for the temerity and injustice of his

      usurpation, appears not liable to any great exception; and he seems to

      have been well qualified, had he succeeded by a just title, to have

      promoted the happiness and prosperity of his subjects.[*] He was possessed

      of industry, activity, and courage, to a great degree; though not endowed

      with a sound judgment, he was not deficient in abilities; he had the

      talent of gaining men’s affections, and notwithstanding his precarious

      situation, he never indulged himself in the exercise of any cruelty or

      revenge. His advancement to the throne procured him neither tranquillity

      nor happiness; and though the situation of England prevented the

      neighboring states from taking any durable advantage of her confusions,

      her intestine disorders were to the last degree ruinous and destructive.

      The court of Rome was also permitted, during those civil wars, to make

      further advances in her usurpations; and appeals to the pope, which had

      always been strictly prohibited by the English laws, became now common in

      every ecclesiastical controversy
