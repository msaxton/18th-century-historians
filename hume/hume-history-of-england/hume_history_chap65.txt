Since the restoration, England had attained a situation which had never

been experienced in any former period of her government, and which seemed

the only one that could fully insure, at once, her tranquillity and her

liberty: the king was in continual want of supply from the parliament, and

he seemed willing to accommodate himself to that dependent situation.

Instead of reviving those claims of prerogative, so strenuously insisted

on by his predecessors, Charles had strictly confined himself within the

limits of law, and had courted, by every art of popularity, the affections

of his subjects. Even the severities, however blamable, which he had

exercised against nonconformists, are to be considered as expedients by

which he strove to ingratiate himself with that party which predominated

in parliament. But notwithstanding these promising appearances, there were

many circumstances which kept the government from resting steadily on that

bottom on which it was placed. The crown, having lost almost all its

ancient demesnes, relied entirely on voluntary grants of the people; and

the commons, not fully accustomed to this new situation, were not yet

disposed to supply, with sufficient liberality, the necessities of the

crown. They imitated too strictly the example of their predecessors in a

rigid frugality of public money; and neither sufficiently considered the

indigent condition of their prince, nor the general state of Europe, where

every nation, by its increase both of magnificence and force, had made

great additions to all public expenses. Some considerable sums, indeed,

were bestowed on Charles; and the patriots of that age, tenacious of

ancient maxims, loudly upbraided the commons with prodigality; but if we

may judge by the example of a later period, when the government has become

more regular, and the harmony of its parts has been more happily adjusted,

the parliaments of this reign seem rather to have merited a contrary

reproach.

 

The natural consequence of the poverty of the crown was besides feeble,

irregular transactions in foreign affairs, a continual uncertainty in its

domestic administration. No one could answer with any tolerable assurance

for the measures of the house of commons. Few of the members were attached

to the court by any other band than that of inclination. Royalists indeed

in their principles, but unexperienced in business, they lay exposed to

every rumor or insinuation; and were driven by momentary gusts or

currents, no less than the populace themselves. Even the attempts made to

gain an ascendant over them by offices, and, as it is believed, by bribes

and pensions, were apt to operate in a manner contrary to what was

intended by the ministers. The novelty of the practice conveyed a general,

and indeed a just alarm; while, at the same time, the poverty of the crown

rendered this influence very limited and precarious.

 

The character of Charles was ill fitted to remedy those defects in the

constitution. He acted in the administration of public affairs, as if

government were a pastime, rather than a serious occupation; and, by the

uncertainty of his conduct he lost that authority which could alone bestow

constancy on the fluctuating resolutions of the parliament. His expenses,

too, which sometimes, perhaps, exceeded the proper bounds, were directed

more by inclination than by policy; and while they increased his

dependence on the parliament, they were not calculated fully to satisfy

either the interested or disinterested part of that assembly.

 

The parliament met after a long adjournment, and the king promised himself

every thing from the attachment of the commons. All his late measures had

been calculated to acquire the good will of his people; and, above all,

the triple league, it was hoped, would be able to efface all the

disagreeable impressions left by the unhappy conclusion of the Dutch war.

But a new attempt made by the court, and a laudable one, too, lost him for

a time the effect of all these endeavors. Buckingham, who was in great

favor with the king, and carried on many intrigues among the commons, had

also endeavored to support connections with the nonconformists; and he now

formed a scheme, in concert with the lord keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman,

and the chief justice, Sir Matthew Hale, two worthy patriots, to put an

end to those severities under which these religionists had so long

labored. It was proposed to reconcile the Presbyterians by a

comprehension, and to grant a toleration to the Independents and other

sectaries Favor seems not, by this scheme, as by others embraced during

the present reign, to have been intended the Catholics: yet were the

zealous commons so disgusted, that they could not be prevailed on even to

give the king thanks for the triple league, however laudable that measure

was then, and has ever since been esteemed. They immediately voted an

address for a proclamation against conventicles. Their request was

complied with; but as the king still dropped some hints of his desire to

reconcile his Protestant subjects, the commons passed a very unusual vote,

that no man should bring into the house any bill of that nature. The king

in vain reiterated his solicitations for supply; represented the necessity

of equipping a fleet; and even offered, that the money which they should

grant should be collected and issued for that purpose by commissioners

appointed by the house. Instead of complying, the commons voted an inquiry

into all the miscarriages during the late war; the slackening of sail

after the duke’s victory from false orders delivered by Brounker the

miscarriage at Bergen, the division of the fleet under Prince Rupert and

Albemarle, the disgrace at Chatham. Brounker was expelled the house, and

ordered to be impeached. Commissioner Pet, who had neglected orders issued

for the security of Chatham, met with the same fate. These impeachments

were never prosecuted. The house at length, having been indulged in all

their prejudices, were prevailed with to vote the king three hundred and

ten thousand pounds, by an imposition on wine and other liquors; after

which they were adjourned.

 

Public business, besides being retarded by the disgust of the commons

against the tolerating maxims of the court, met with obstructions this

session from a quarrel between the two houses. Skinner, a rich merchant in

London, having suffered some injuries from the East India Company, laid

the matter by petition before the house of lords, by whom he was relieved

in costs and damages to the amount of five thousand pounds. The commons

voted, that the lords, in taking cognizance of this affair, originally,

without any appeal from inferior courts, had acted in a manner not

agreeable to the laws of the land, and tending to deprive the subject of

the right, ease, and benefit due to him by these laws; and that Skinner,

in prosecuting the suit after this manner, had infringed the privileges of

the commons; for which offence they ordered him to be taken into custody.

Some conferences ensued between the houses where the lords were tenacious

of their right of judicature, and maintained, that the method in which

they had exercised it was quite regular. The commons rose into a great

ferment; and went so far as to vote, that “whoever should be aiding or

assisting in putting in execution the order or sentence of the house of

lords, in the case of Skinner against the East India Company, should be

deemed a betrayer of the rights and liberties of the commons of England,

and an infringer of the privileges of the house of commons.” They rightly

judged, that it would not be easy, after this vote, to find any one who

would venture to incur their indignation. The proceedings indeed of the

lords seem in this case to have been unusual and without precedent.

 

1669

 

The king’s necessities obliged him again to assemble the parliament, who

showed some disposition to relieve him. The price, however, which he must

pay for this indulgence, was his yielding to new laws against

conventicles. His complaisance in this particular contributed more to gain

the commons, than all the pompous pretences of supporting the triple

alliance, that popular measure by which he expected to make such

advantage. The quarrel between the two houses was revived; and as the

commons had voted only four hundred thousand pounds, with which the king

was not satisfied, he thought proper, before they had carried their vote

into a law, to prorogue them. The only business finished this short

session, was the receiving of the report of the committee appointed for

examining the public accounts. On the first inspection of this report,

there appears a great sum, no less than a million and a half, unaccounted

for; and the natural inference is, that the king had much abused the trust

reposed in him by parliament But a more accurate inspection of particulars

serves, in a great measure, to remove this imputation. The king indeed

went so far as to tell the parliament from the throne, “that he had fully

informed himself of that matter, and did affirm, that no part of those

moneys which they had given him had been diverted to other uses; but, on

the contrary, besides all those supplies, a very great sum had been raised

out of his standing revenue and credit, and a very great debt contracted;

and all for the war.” Though artificial pretences have often been employed

by kings in their speeches to parliament, and by none more than Charles,

it is somewhat difficult to suspect him of a direct lie and falsehood. He

must have had some reasons, and perhaps not unplausible ones, for this

affirmation, of which all his hearers, as they had the accounts lying

before them, were at that time competent judges.[*] 2
 

The method which all parliaments had hitherto followed, was to vote a

particular sum for the supply, without any distinction, or any

appropriation to particular services. So long as the demands of the crown

were small and casual, no great inconveniencies arose from this practice.

But as all the measures of government were now changed, it must be

confessed that, if the king made a just application of public money, this

inaccurate method of proceeding, by exposing him to suspicion, was

prejudicial to him. If he were inclined to act otherwise, it was equally

hurtful to the people. For these reasons, a contrary practice, during all

the late reigns, has constantly been followed by the commons.

 

1670

 

When the parliament met after the prorogation, they entered anew upon the

business of supply, and granted the king an additional duty, during eight

years, of twelve pounds on each tun of Spanish wine imported, eight on

each tun of French. A law also passed, empowering him to sell the fee-farm

rents; the last remains of the demesnes, by which the ancient kings of

England had been supported. By this expedient, he obtained some supply for

his present necessities, but left the crown, if possible, still more

dependent than before. How much money might be raised by these sales is

uncertain; but it could not be near one million eight hundred thousand

pounds, the sum assigned by some writers.[*]

 

The act against conventicles passed, and received the royal assent. It

bears the appearance of mitigating the former persecuting laws; but if we

may judge by the spirit which had broken out almost every session during

this parliament, it was not intended as any favor to the nonconformists.

Experience probably had taught, that laws over rigid and severe could not

be executed. By this act, the hearer in a conventicle (that is, in a

dissenting assembly, where more than five were present, besides the

family) was fined five shillings for the first offence, ten for the

second; the preacher, twenty pounds for the first offence, forty for the

second. The person in whose house the conventicle met, was amerced a like

sum with the preacher. One clause is remarkable; that if any dispute

should arise the judges should always explain the doubt in the sense least

favorable to conventicles, it being the intention of parliament entirely

to suppress them. Such was the zeal of the commons, that they violated the

plainest and most established maxims of civil policy, which require that

in all criminal prosecutions favor should always be given to the prisoner.

 

The affair of Skinner still remained a ground of quarrel between the two

houses; but the king prevailed with the peers to accept of the expedient

proposed by the commons, that a general razure should be made of all the

transactions with regard to that disputed question.

 

Some attempts were made by the king to effect a union between England and

Scotland; though they were too feeble to remove all the difficulties which

obstructed that useful and important undertaking. Commissioners were

appointed to meet, in order to regulate the conditions: but the design,

chiefly by the intrigues of Lauderdale, soon after came to nothing.

 

The king about this time began frequently to attend the debates of the

house of peers. He said, that they amused him, and that he found them no

less entertaining than a play. But deeper designs were suspected. As he

seemed to interest himself extremely in the cause of Lord Roos, who had

obtained a divorce from his wife on the accusation of adultery, and

applied to parliament for leave to marry again, people imagined that

Charles intended to make a precedent of the case, and that some other

pretence would be found for getting rid of the queen. Many proposals to

this purpose, it is said, were made him by Buckingham; but the king, how

little scrupulous soever in some respects, was incapable of any action

harsh or barbarous; and he always rejected every scheme of this nature. A

suspicion, however, of such intentions, it was observed, had at this time

begotten a coldness between the two royal brothers.

 

We now come to a period when the king’s counsels, which had hitherto in

the main been good, though negligent and fluctuating, became, during some

time, remarkably bad, or even criminal; and breeding incurable jealousies

in all men, were followed by such consequences as had almost terminated in

the ruin both of prince and people. Happily, the same negligence still

attended him; and, as it had lessened the influence of the good, it also

diminished the effect of the bad measures which he embraced.

 

It was remarked, that the committee of council established for foreign

affairs was entirely changed; and that Prince Rupert the duke of Ormond,

Sectary Trevor, and Lord Keeper Bridgeman, men in whose honor the nation

had great confidence, were never called to any deliberations. The whole

secret was intrusted to five persons, Clifford, Ashley, Buckingham,

Arlington, and Lauderdale. These men were known by the appellation of the

“cabal,” a word which the initial letters of their names happened to

compose. Never was there a more dangerous ministry in England, nor one

more noted for pernicious counsels.

 

Lord Ashley, soon after known by the name of earl of Shaftesbury, was one

of the most remarkable characters of the age, and the chief spring of all

the succeeding movements. During his early youth, he had engaged in the

late king’s party; but being disgusted with some measures of Prince

Maurice, he soon deserted to the parliament. He insinuated himself into

the confidence of Cromwell; and as he had great influence with the

Presbyterians, he was serviceable in supporting, with his party, the

authority of that usurper. He employed the same credit in promoting the

restoration; and on that account both deserved and acquired favor with the

king. In all his changes, he still maintained the character of never

betraying those friends whom he deserted; and whichever party he joined,

his great capacity and singular talents soon gained him their confidence,

and enabled him to take the lead among them. No station could satisfy his

ambition, no fatigues were insuperable to his industry. Well acquainted

with the blind attachment of faction, he surmounted all sense of shame;

and relying on the subtilty of his contrivances, he was not startled with

enterprises the most hazardous and most criminal. His talents, both of

public speaking and private insinuation, shone out in an eminent degree;

and amidst all his furious passions, he possessed a sound judgment of

business, and still more of men. Though fitted by nature for beginning and

pushing the greatest undertakings, he was never able to conduct any to a

happy period; and his eminent abilities, by reason of his insatiable

desires, were equally dangerous to himself, to the prince, and to the

people.

 

The duke of Buckingham possessed all the advantages which a graceful

person, a high rank, a splendid fortune, and a lively wit could bestow;

but by his wild conduct, unrestrained either by prudence or principle, he

found means to render himself in the end odious, and even insignificant.

The least interest could make him abandon his honor; the smallest pleasure

could seduce him from his interest; the most frivolous caprice was

sufficient to counterbalance his pleasure*[**missing period] By his want

of secrecy and constancy, he destroyed his character in public life; by

his contempt of order and economy, he dissipated his private fortune; by

riot and debauchery, he ruined his health; and he remained at last as

incapable of doing hurt, as he had ever been little desirous of doing good

to mankind.

 

The earl, soon after created duke of Lauderdale, was not defective in

natural, and still less in acquired talents; but neither was his address

graceful, nor his understanding just. His principles, or, more properly

speaking, his prejudices, were obstinate, but unable to restrain his

ambition: his ambition was still less dangerous than the tyranny and

violence of his temper. An implacable enemy, but a lukewarm friend;

insolent to his inferiors, but abject to his superiors; though in his

whole character and deportment he was almost diametrically opposite to the

king, he had the fortune, beyond any other minister, to maintain, during

the greater part of his reign, an ascendant over him.

 

The talents of parliamentary eloquence and intrigue had raised Sir Thomas

Clifford; and his daring, impetuous spirit gave him weight in the king’s

councils. Of the whole cabal, Arlington was the least dangerous, either by

his vices or his talents. His judgment was sound, though his capacity was

but moderate; and his intentions were good, though he wanted courage and

integrity to persevere in them. Together with Temple and Bridgeman, he had

been a great promoter of the triple league; but he threw himself with

equal alacrity into opposite measures, when he found them agreeable to his

master. Clifford and he were secretly Catholics: Shaftesbury, though

addicted to astrology, was reckoned a deist: Buckingham had too little

reflection to embrace any steady principles: Lauderdale had long been a

bigoted and furious Presbyterian; and the opinions of that sect still kept

possession of his mind, how little soever they appeared in his conduct.

 

The dark counsels of the cabal, though from the first they gave anxiety to

all men of reflection, were not thoroughly known but by the event. Such

seem to have been the views which they, in concurrence with some Catholic

courtiers who had the ear of their sovereign, suggested to the king and

the duke, and which these princes too greedily embraced. They said, that

the parliament, though the spirit of party, for the present, attached them

to the crown, were still more attached to those powers and privileges

which their predecessors had usurped from the sovereign: that after the

first flow of kindness was spent, they had discovered evident symptoms of

discontent; and would be sure to turn against the king all the authority

which they yet retained, and still more those pretensions which it was

easy for them in a moment to revive: that they not only kept the king in

dependence by means of his precarious revenue, but had never discovered a

suitable generosity, even in those temporary supplies which they granted

him: that it was high time for the prince to rouse himself from his

lethargy, and to recover that authority which his predecessors, during so

many ages, had peaceably enjoyed; that the great error or misfortune of

his father was, the not having formed any close connection with foreign

princes, who, on the breaking out of the rebellion, might have found their

interest in supporting him: that the present alliances, being entered into

with so many weaker potentates, who themselves stood in need of the king’s

protection, could never serve to maintain much less augment, the royal

authority: that the French monarch alone, so generous a prince, and by

blood so nearly allied to the king, would be found both able and willing,

if gratified in his ambition, to defend the common cause of kings against

usurping subjects: that a war undertaken against Holland by the united

force of two such mighty potentates, would prove an easy enterprise, and

would serve all the purposes which were aimed at: that, under pretence of

that war, it would not be difficult to levy a military force, without

which, during the prevalence of republican principles among his subjects,

the king would vainly expect to defend his prerogative; that his naval

power might be maintained, partly by the supplies which on other pretences

would previously be obtained from parliament; partly by subsidies from

France; partly by captures, which might easily be made on that opulent

republic: that, in such a situation, attempts to recover the lost

authority of the crown would be attended with success; nor would any

malecontents dare to resist a prince fortified by so powerful an alliance;

or, if they did, they would only draw more certain ruin on themselves and

on their cause; and that by subduing the states, a great step would be

made towards a reformation of the government; since it was apparent, that

that republic, by its fame and grandeur, fortified in his factious

subjects their attachment to what they vainly termed their civil and

religious liberties.

 

These suggestions happened fatally to concur with all the inclinations and

prejudices of the king; his desire of more extensive authority, his

propensity to the Catholic religion, his avidity for money. He seems,

likewise, from the very beginning of his reign, to have entertained great

jealousy of his own subjects, and, on that account, a desire of fortifying

himself by an intimate alliance with France. So early as 1664, he had

offered the French monarch to allow him without opposition to conquer

Flanders, provided that prince would engage to furnish him with ten

thousand infantry, and a suitable number of cavalry, in case of any

rebellion in England.[*] As no dangerous symptoms at that time appeared,

we are left to conjecture, from this incident, what opinion Charles had

conceived of the factious disposition of his people.

 

Even during the time when the triple alliance was the most zealously

cultivated, the king never seems to have been entirely cordial in those

salutary measures, but still to have cast a longing eye towards the French

alliance. Clifford, who had much of his confidence, said imprudently,

“Notwithstanding all this joy, we must have a second war with Holland.”

 The accession of the emperor to that alliance had been refused by England

on frivolous pretences. And many unfriendly cavils were raised against the

states with regard to Surinam and the conduct of the East India

Company.[**] 3

But about April, 1669 the strongest symptoms appeared of those fatal

measure which were afterwards more openly pursued.

 

De Wit at that time came to Temple, and told him, that he paid him a visit

as a friend, not as a minister. The occasion was, to acquaint him with a

conversation which he had lately had with Puffendorf, the Swedish agent,

who had passed by the Hague in the way from Paris to his own country. The

French ministers, Puffendorf said, had taken much pains to persuade him,

that the Swedes would very ill find their account in those measures which

they had lately embraced: that Spain would fail them in all her promises

of subsidies; nor would Holland alone be able to support them: that

England would certainly fail them, and had already adopted counsels

directly opposite to those which by the triple league she had bound

herself to pursue: and that the resolution was not the less fixed and

certain, because the secret was as yet communicated to very few either in

the French or English court. When Puffendorf seemed incredulous, Turenne

showed him a letter from Colbert de Crossy, the French minister at London;

in which after mentioning the success of his negotiations, and the

favorable disposition of the chief ministers there, he added, “And I have

at last made them sensible of the full extent of his majesty’s bounty.”[*]

From this incident it appears, that the infamous practice of selling

themselves to foreign princes, a practice which, notwithstanding the

malignity of the vulgar, is certainly rare among men in high office, had

not been scrupled by Charles’s ministers, who even obtained their master’s

consent to this dishonorable corruption.

 

But while all men of penetration, both abroad and at home were alarmed

with these incidents, the visit which the king received from his sister,

the duchess of Orleans, was the foundation of still stronger suspicions.

Lewis, knowing the address and insinuation of that amiable princess, and

the great influence which she had gained over her brother, had engaged her

to employ all her good offices in order to detach Charles from the triple

league, which, he knew, had fixed such unsurmountable barriers to his

ambition; and he now sent her to put the last hand to the plan of their

conjunct operations. That he might the better cover this negotiation, he

pretended to visit his frontiers, particularly the great works which he

had undertaken at Dunkirk: and he carried the queen and the whole court

along with him. While he remained on the opposite shore, the duchess of

Orleans went over to England; and Charles met her at Dover, where they

passed ten days together in great mirth and festivity. By her artifices

and caresses, she prevailed on Charles to relinquish the most settled

maxims of honor and policy, and to finish his engagements with Lewis for

the destruction of Holland, as well as for the subsequent change of

religion in England.

 

But Lewis well knew Charles’s character, and the usual fluctuations of his

counsels. In order to fix him in the French interests, he resolved to bind

him by the ties of pleasure, the only ones which with him were

irresistible; and he made him a present of a French mistress, by whose

means he hoped for the future to govern him. The duchess of Orleans

brought with her a young lady of the name of Querouaille, whom the king

carried to London, and soon after created duchess of Portsmouth. He was

extremely attached to her during the whole course of his life; and she

proved a great means of supporting his connections with her native

country.

 

The satisfaction which Charles reaped from his new alliance received a

great check by the death of his sister, and still more by those melancholy

circumstances which attended it. Her death was sudden, after a few days’

illness; and she was seized with the malady upon drinking a glass of

succory water. Strong suspicions of poison arose in the court of France,

and were spread all over Europe; and as her husband had discovered many

symptoms of jealousy and discontent on account of her conduct, he was

universally believed to be the author of the crime. Charles himself,

during some time, was entirely convinced of his guilt; but upon receiving

the attestation of physicians, who, on opening her body, found no

foundation for the general rumor, he was, or pretended to be, satisfied.

The duke of Orleans indeed did never, in any other circumstance of his

life, betray such dispositions as might lead him to so criminal an action;

and a lady, it is said, drank the remains of the same glass, without

feeling any inconvenience. The sudden death of princes is commonly

accompanied with these dismal surmises; and therefore less weight is in

this case to be laid on the suspicions of the public.

 

Charles, instead of breaking with France upon this incident, took

advantage of it to send over Buckingham, under pretence of condoling with

the duke of Orleans, but in reality to concert further measures for the

projected war. Never ambassador received greater caresses. The more

destructive the present measures were to the interests of England, the

more natural was it for Lewis to load with civilities, and even with

favors, those whom he could engage to promote them.

 

The journey of Buckingham augmented the suspicions in Holland, which every

circumstance tended still further to confirm. Lewis made a sudden

irruption into Lorraine; and though he missed seizing the duke himself,

who had no surmise of the danger, and who narrowly escaped, he was soon

able, without resistance, to make himself master of the whole country. The

French monarch was so far unhappy, that, though the most tempting

opportunities offered themselves, he had not commonly so much as the

pretence of equity and justice to cover his ambitious measures. This

acquisition of Lorraine ought to have excited the jealousy of the

contracting powers in the triple league, as much as an invasion of

Flanders itself; yet did Charles turn a deaf ear to all remonstrances made

him upon that subject.

 

But what tended chiefly to open the eyes of De Wit and the states with

regard to the measures of England, was the sudden recall of Sir William

Temple. This minister had so firmly established his character of honor and

integrity, that he was believed incapable even of obeying his master’s

commands in promoting measures which he esteemed pernicious to his

country; and so long as he remained in employment, De Wit thought himself

assured of the fidelity of England. Charles was so sensible of this

prepossession, that he ordered Temple to leave his family at the Hague,

and pretended that that minister would immediately return, after having

conferred with the king about some business where his negotiation had met

with obstructions. De Wit made the Dutch resident inform the English

court, that he should consider the recall of Temple as an express

declaration of a change of measures in England; and should even know what

interpretation to put upon any delay of his return.

 

While these measures were secretly in agitation, the parliament met,

according to adjournment. The king made a short speech, and left the

business to be enlarged upon by the keeper. That minister much insisted on

the king’s great want of supply; the mighty increase of the naval power of

France, now triple to what it was before the last war with Holland; the

decay of the English navy; the necessity of fitting out next year a fleet

of fifty sail; the obligations which the king lay under by several

treaties to exert himself for the common good of Christendom. Among other

treaties, he mentioned the triple alliance, and the defensive league with

the states.

 

The artifice succeeded. The house of commons, entirely satisfied with the

king’s measures, voted him considerable supplies. A laud tax for a year

was imposed of a shilling a pound; two shillings a pound on two thirds of

the salaries of offices; fifteen shillings on every hundred pounds of

bankers’ money and stock; an additional excise upon beer for six years,

and certain impositions upon law proceedings for nine years. The

parliament had never before been in a more liberal humor; and never surely

was it less merited by the counsels of the king and of his ministers.[*]

 

The commons passed another bill, for laying a duty on tobacco, Scotch

salt, glasses, and some other commodities. Against this bill the merchants

of London appeared by petition before the house of lords. The lords

entered into their reasons, and began to make amendments on the bill sent

up by the commons. This attempt was highly resented by the lower house as

an encroachment on the right, which they pretended to possess alone, of

granting money to the crown. Many remonstrances passed between the two

houses; and by their altercations the king was obliged to prorogue the

parliament; and he thereby lost the money which was intended him.

 

1671

 

This is the last time that the peers have revived any pretensions of that

nature. Ever since, the privilege of the commons, in all other places

except in the house of peers, has passed for uncontroverted.

 

There was another private affair transacted about this time, by which the

king was as much exposed to the imputation of a capricious lenity, as he

was here blamed for unnecessary severity. Blood, a disbanded officer of

the protector’s, had been engaged in the conspiracy for raising an

insurrection in Ireland; and on account of this crime, he himself had been

attainted, and some of his accomplices capitally punished. The daring

villain meditated revenge upon Ormond, the lord lieutenant. Having by

artifice drawn off the duke’s footmen, he attacked his coach in the night

time, as it drove along St. James’s Street in London; and he made himself

master of his person. He might here have finished the crime, had he not

meditated refinements in his vengeance: he was resolved to hang the duke

of Tyburn and for that purpose bound him and mounted him on horseback

behind one of his companions. They were advanced a good way into the

fields, when the duke, making efforts for his liberty, threw himself to

the ground, and brought down with him the assassin to whom he was

fastened. They were struggling together in the mire, when Ormond’s

servants, whom the alarm had reached, came and saved him. Blood and his

companions, firing their pistols in a hurry at the duke, rode off, and

saved themselves by means of the darkness.

 

Buckingham was at first, with some appearances of reason, suspected to be

the author of this attempt. His profligate character, and his enmity

against Ormond, exposed him to that imputation; Ossory soon after came to

court, and seeing Buckingham stand by the king, his color rose, and he

could not forbear expressing himself to this purpose: “My lord, I know

well that you are at the bottom of this late attempt upon my father: but I

give you warning; if by any means he come to a violent end, I shall not be

at a loss to know the author: I shall consider you as the assassin: I

shall treat you as such; and wherever I meet you, I shall pistol you,

though you stood behind the king’s chair; and I tell it you in his

majesty’s presence, that you may be sure I shall not fail of

performance.”[*] If there was here any indecorum, it was easily excused in

a generous youth, when his father’s life was exposed to danger.

 

A little after, Blood formed a design of carrying off the crown and

regalia from the Tower; a design to which he was prompted, as well by the

surprising boldness of the enterprise, as by the views of profit. He was

near succeeding. He had bound and wounded Edwards, the keeper of the

jewel-office, and had gotten out of the Tower with his prey; but was

overtaken and seized, with some of his associates. One of them was known

to have been concerned in the attempt upon Ormond; and Blood was

immediately concluded to be the ring-leader. When questioned, he frankly

avowed the enterprise; but refused to tell his accomplices. “The fear of

death,” he said, “should never engage him either to deny a guilt or betray

a friend.” All these extraordinary circumstances made him the general

subject of conversation; and the king was moved by an idle curiosity to

see and speak with a person so noted for his courage and his crimes. Blood

might now esteem himself secure of pardon; and he wanted not address to

improve the opportunity. He told Charles, that he had been engaged, with

others, in a design to kill him with a carabine above Battersea, where his

majesty often went to bathe: that the cause of this resolution was the

severity exercised over the consciences of the godly, in restraining the

liberty of their religious assemblies: that when he had taken his stand

among the reeds, full of these bloody resolutions, he found his heart

checked with an awe of majesty; and he not only relented himself, but

diverted his associates from their purpose: that he had long ago brought

himself to an entire indifference about life, which he now gave for lost;

yet could he not forbear warning the king of the danger which might attend

his execution: that his associates had bound themselves by the strictest

oaths to revenge the death of any of the confederacy; and that no

precaution or power could secure any one from the effects of their

desperate resolutions.

 

Whether these considerations excited fear or admiration in the king, they

confirmed his resolution of granting a pardon to Blood; but he thought it

a point of decency first to obtain the duke of Ormond’s consent. Arlington

came to Ormond in the king’s name, and desired that he would not prosecute

Blood, for reasons which he was commanded to give him. The duke replied,

that his majesty’s commands were the only reason that could be given, and

being sufficient, he might therefore spare the rest. Charles carried his

kindness to Blood still further: he granted him an estate of five hundred

pounds a year in Ireland; he encouraged his attendance about his person;

he showed him great countenance; and many applied to him for promoting

their pretensions at court. And while old Edwards, who had bravely

ventured his life, and had been wounded, in defending the crown and

regalia, was forgotten and neglected, this man, who deserved only to be

stared at and detested as a monster, became a kind of favorite.

 

Errors of this nature in private life have often as bad an influence as

miscarriages in which the public is more immediately concerned. Another

incident happened this year, which infused a general displeasure, and

still greater apprehensions, into all men. The duchess of York died; and

in her last sickness, she made open profession of the Romish religion, and

finished her life in that communion. This put an end to that thin disguise

which the duke had hitherto worn and he now openly declared his conversion

to the church of Rome. Unaccountable terrors of Popery, ever since the

accession of the house of Stuart, had prevailed throughout the nation; but

these had formerly been found so groundless, and had been employed to so

many bad purposes, that surmises of this nature were likely to meet with

the less credit among all men of sense; and nothing but the duke’s

imprudent bigotry could have convinced the whole nation of his change of

religion. Popery, which had hitherto been only a hideous spectre, was now

become a real ground of terror being openly and zealously embraced by the

heir to the crown a prince of industry and enterprise; while the king

himself was not entirely free from like suspicions.

 

It is probable that the new alliance with France inspired the duke with

the courage to make open profession of his religion, and rendered him more

careless of the affections and esteem of the English. This alliance became

every day more apparent. Temple was declared to be no longer ambassador to

the states, and Downing, whom the Dutch regarded as the inveterate enemy

of their republic, was sent over in his stead. A ground of quarrel was

sought by means of a yacht, despatched for Lady Temple. The captain sailed

through the Dutch fleet, which lay on their own coasts; and he had orders

to make them strike, to fire on them, and to persevere till they should

return his fire. The Dutch admiral, Van Ghent, surprised at this bravado,

came on board the yacht, and expressed his willingness to pay respect to

the British flag, according to former practice: but that a fleet on their

own coasts should strike to a single vessel, and that not a ship of war,

was, he said, such an innovation, that he durst not without express orders

agree to it. The captain, thinking it dangerous, as well as absurd, to

renew firing in the midst of the Dutch fleet, continued his course; and

for that neglect of orders was committed to the Tower.

 

This incident, however, furnished Downing with a new article to increase

those vain pretences on which it was purposed to ground the intended

rupture. The English court delayed several months before they complained;

lest, if they had demanded satisfaction more early, the Dutch might have

had time to grant it. Even when Downing delivered his memorial, he was

bound by his instructions not to accept of any satisfaction after a

certain number of days: a very imperious manner of negotiating, and

impracticable in Holland, where the forms of the republic render delays

absolutely unavoidable. An answer, however, though refused by Downing, was

sent over to London; with an ambassador extraordinary, who had orders to

use every expedient that might give satisfaction to the court of England.

That court replied, that the answer of the Hollanders was ambiguous and

obscure; but they would not specify the articles or expressions which were

liable to that objection. The Dutch ambassador desired the English

ministry to draw the answer in what terms they pleased; and he engaged to

sign it: the English ministry replied, that it was not their business to

draw papers for the Dutch. The ambassador brought them the draught of an

article, and asked them whether it were satisfactory: the English

answered, that when he had signed and delivered it, they would tell him

their mind concerning it. The Dutchman resolved to sign it at a venture;

and on his demanding a new audience, an hour was appointed for that

purpose: but when he attended, the English refused to enter upon business,

and told him that the season for negotiating was now past.[*]

 

1672

 

Long and frequent prorogations were made of the parliament; lest the

houses should declare themselves with vigor against counsels so opposite

to the inclination as well as interests of the public. Could we suppose

that Charles, in his alliance against Holland, really meant the good of

his people, that measure must pass for an extraordinary, nay, a romantic

strain of patriotism, which could lead him, in spite of all difficulties,

and even in spite of themselves, to seek the welfare of the nation. But

every step which he took in this affair became a proof to all men of

penetration, that the present war was intended against the religion and

liberties of his own subjects, even more than against the Dutch

themselves. He now acted in every thing as if he were already an absolute

monarch, and was never more to lie under the control of national

assemblies.

 

The long prorogations of parliament, if they freed the king from the

importunate remonstrances of that assembly, were, however, attended with

this inconvenience, that no money could be procured to carry on the

military preparations against Holland. Under pretence of maintaining the

triple league, which at that very time he had firmly resolved to break,

Charles had obtained a large supply from the commons; but this money was

soon exhausted by debts and expenses. France had stipulated to pay two

hundred thousand pounds a year during the war; but that supply was

inconsiderable, compared to the immense charge of the English navy. It

seemed as yet premature to venture on levying money without consent of

parliament; since the power of taxing themselves was the privilege of

which the English were with reason particularly jealous. Some other

resource must be fallen on. The king had declared, that the staff of

treasurer was ready for any one that could find an expedient for supplying

the present necessities. Shaftesbury dropped a hint to Clifford, which the

latter immediately seized, and carried to the king, who granted him the

promised reward, together with a peerage. This expedient was the shutting

up of the exchequer and the retaining of all the payments which should be

made into it.

 

It had been usual for the bankers to carry their money to the exchequer,

and to advance it upon security of the funds, by which they were

afterwards reimbursed when the money was levied on the public. The bankers

by this traffic got eight, sometimes ten per cent., for sums which either

had been consigned to them without interest, or which they had borrowed at

six per cent.; profits which they dearly paid for by this egregious breach

of public faith. The measure was so suddenly taken, that none had warning

of the danger. A general confusion prevailed in the city, followed by the

ruin of many. The bankers stopped payment; the merchants could answer no

bills; distrust took place every where, with a stagnation of commerce, by

which the public was universally affected. And men, full of dismal

apprehensions, asked each other what must be the scope of those mysterious

counsels, whence the parliament and all men of honor were excluded, and

which commenced by the forfeiture of public credit, and an open violation

of the most solemn engagements, both foreign and domestic.

 

Another measure of the court contains something laudable, when considered

in itself; but if we reflect on the motive whence it proceeded, as well as

the time when it was embraced, it will furnish a strong proof of the

arbitrary and dangerous counsels pursued at present by the king and his

ministry. Charles resolved to make use of his supreme power in

ecclesiastical matters; a power, he said, which was not only inherent in

him, but which had been recognized by several acts of parliament. By

virtue of this authority, he issued a proclamation, suspending the penal

laws enacted against all nonconformists or recusants whatsoever; and

granting to the Protestant dissenters the public exercise of their

religion, to the Catholics the exercise of it in private houses. A

fruitless experiment of this kind, opposed by the parliament, and

retracted by the king, had already been made a few years after the

restoration; but Charles expected that the parliament, whenever it should

meet, would now be tamed to greater submission, and would no longer dare

to control his measures. Meanwhile the dissenters, the most inveterate

enemies of the court, were mollified by these indulgent maxims: and the

Catholics, under their shelter, enjoyed more liberty than the laws had

hitherto allowed them.

 

At the same time, the act of navigation was suspended by royal will and

pleasure; a measure which, though a stretch of prerogative, seemed useful

to commerce, while all the seamen were employed on board the royal navy. A

like suspension had been granted during the first Dutch war, and was not

much remarked; because men had at that time entertained less jealousy of

the crown. A proclamation was also issued, containing rigorous clauses in

favor of pressing; another full of menaces against those who presumed to

speak undutifully of his majesty’s measures, and even against those who

heard such discourse, unless they informed in due time against the

offenders; another against importing or vending any sort of painted

earthenware, “except those of China, upon pain of being grievously fined,

and suffering the utmost punishment which might be lawfully inflicted upon

contemners of his majesty’s royal authority.” An army had been levied; and

it was found that discipline could not be enforced without the exercise of

martial law, which was therefore established by order of council, though

contrary to the petition of right. All these acts of power, how little

important soever in themselves, savored strongly of arbitrary government;

and were nowise suitable to that legal administration which the

parliament, after such violent convulsions and civil wars, had hoped to

have established in the kingdom.

 

It may be worth remarking, that the lord keeper refused to affix the great

seal to the declaration for suspending the penal laws; and was for that

reason, though under other pretences removed from his office. Shaftesbury

was made chancellor in his place; and thus another member of the cabal

received the reward of his counsels.

 

Foreign transactions kept pace with these domestic occurrences. An

attempt, before the declaration of war, was made on the Dutch Smyrna fleet

by Sir Robert Holmes. This fleet consisted of seventy sail, valued at a

million and a half; and the hopes of seizing so rich a prey had been a

great motive for engaging Charles in the present war, and he had

considered that capture as a principal resource for supporting his

military enterprises. Holmes, with nine frigates and three yachts, had

orders to go on this command; and he passed Sprague in the Channel, who

was returning with a squadron from a cruize in the Mediterranean. Sprague

informed him of the near approach of the Hollanders; and had not Holmes,

from a desire of engrossing the honor and profit of the enterprise, kept

the secret of his orders, the conjunction of these squadrons had rendered

the success infallible. When Holmes approached the Dutch, he put on an

amicable appearance, and invited the admiral Van Ness, who commanded the

convoy, to come on board of him: one of his captains gave a like insidious

invitation to the rear-admiral. But these officers were on their guard.

They had received an intimation of the hostile intentions of the English,

and had already put all the ships of war and merchantmen in an excellent

posture of defence. Three times were they valiantly assailed by the

English; and as often did they valiantly defend themselves. In the third

attack, one of the Dutch ships of war was taken; and three or four of

their most inconsiderable merchantmen fell into the enemies’ hands. The

rest, fighting with skill and courage, continued their course; and,

favored by a mist, got safe into their own harbors. This attempt is

denominated perfidious and piratical by the Dutch writers, and even by

many of the English. It merits at least the appellation of irregular; and

as it had been attended with bad success, it brought double shame upon the

contrivers. The English ministry endeavored to apologize for the action,

by pretending that it was a casual rencounter, arising from the obstinacy

of the Dutch in refusing the honors of the flag: but the contrary was so

well known, that even Holmes himself had not the assurance to persist in

this asseveration.

 

Till this incident, the states, notwithstanding all the menaces and

preparations of the English, never believed them thoroughly in earnest;

and had always expected, that the affair would terminate, either in some

demands of money, or in some proposals for the advancement of the prince

of Orange. The French themselves had never much reckoned on assistance

from England; and scarcely could believe that their ambitious projects

would, contrary to every maxim of honor and policy, be forwarded by that

power which was most interested and most able to oppose them. But Charles

was too far advanced to retreat. He immediately issued a declaration of

war against the Dutch; and surely reasons more false and frivolous never

were employed to justify a flagrant violation of treaty. Some complaints

are there made of injuries done to the East India Company, which yet that

company disavowed: the detention of some English in Surinam is mentioned;

though it appears that these persons had voluntarily remained there: the

refusal of a Dutch fleet on their own coasts to strike to an English

yacht, is much aggravated: and to piece up all these pretensions, some

abusive pictures are mentioned, and represented as a ground of quarrel.

The Dutch were long at a loss what to make of this article, till it was

discovered that a portrait of Cornelius de Wit, brother to the pensionary,

painted by order of certain magistrates of Dort, and hung up in a chamber

of the town-house, had given occasion to the complaint. In the perspective

of this portrait, the painter had drawn some ships on fire in a harbor.

This was construed to be Chatham, where De Wit had really distinguished

himself, and had acquired honor; but little did he imagine that, while the

insult itself committed in open war, had so long been forgiven, the

picture of it should draw such severe vengeance upon his country. The

conclusion of this manifesto, where the king still professed his

resolution of adhering to the triple alliance, was of a piece with the

rest of it.

 

Lewis’s declaration of war contained more dignity, if undisguised violence

and injustice could merit that appellation. He pretended only, that the

behavior of the Hollanders had been such, that it did not consist with his

glory any longer to bear.

 

That monarch’s preparations were in great forwardness; and his ambition

was flattered with the most promising views of success. Sweden was

detached from the triple league; the bishop of Munster was engaged by the

payment of subsidies to take part with France; the elector of Cologne had

entered into the same alliance; and having consigned Bonne and other towns

into the hands of Lewis, magazines were there erected; and it was from

that quarter that France purposed to invade the United Provinces. The

standing force of that kingdom amounted to a hundred and eighty thousand

men; and with more than half of this great army was the French king now

approaching to the Dutch frontiers. The order, economy, and industry of

Colbert, equally subservient to the ambition of the prince and happiness

of the people, furnished unexhausted treasures: these, employed by the

unrelenting vigilance of Louvois, supplied every military preparation, and

facilitated all the enterprises of the army: CondÃ©, Turenne, seconded by

Luxembourg, Crequi, and the most renowned generals of the age, conducted

this army, and by their conduct and reputation inspired courage into every

one. The monarch himself, surrounded with a brave nobility, animated his

troops by the prospect of reward, or, what was more valued, by the hopes

of his approbation. The fatigues of war gave no interruption to gayety:

its dangers furnished matter for glory; and in no enterprise did the

genius of that gallant and polite people ever break out with more

distinguished lustre.

 

Though De Wit’s intelligence in foreign courts was not equal to the

vigilance of his domestic administration, he had long before received many

surmises of this fatal confederacy; but he prepared not for defence so

early, or with such industry, as the danger required. A union of England

with France was evidently, he saw, destructive to the interests of the

former kingdom; and therefore, overlooking or ignorant of the humors and

secret views of Charles, he concluded it impossible that such pernicious

projects could ever really be carried into execution. Secure in this

fallacious reasoning, he allowed the republic to remain too long in that

defenceless situation into which many concurring accidents had conspired

to throw her.

 

By a continued and successful application to commerce, the people were

become unwarlike, and confided entirely for their defence in that

mercenary army which they maintained. After the treaty of Westphalia, the

states, trusting to their peace with Spain, and their alliance with

France, had broken a great part of this army, and did not support with

sufficient vigilance the discipline of the troops which remained. When the

aristocratic party prevailed, it was thought prudent to dismiss many of

the old, experienced officers, who were devoted to the house of Orange;

and their place was supplied by raw youths, the sons or kinsmen of

burgomasters, by whose interest the party was supported. These new

officers, relying on the credit of their friends and family, neglected

their military duty; and some of them, it is said, were even allowed to

serve by deputies, to whom they assigned a small part of their pay. During

the war with England, all the forces of that nation had been disbanded:

Lewis’s invasion of Flanders, followed by the triple league, occasioned

the dismission of the French regiments: and the place of these troops,

which had ever had a chief share in the honor and fortune of all the wars

in the Low Countries, had not been supplied by any new levies.

 

De Wit, sensible of this dangerous situation, and alarmed by the reports

which came from all quarters, exerted himself to supply those defects to

which it was not easy of a sudden to provide a suitable remedy. But every

proposal which he could make met with opposition from the Orange party,

now become extremely formidable. The long and uncontrolled administration

of this statesman had begotten envy; the present incidents roused up his

enemies and opponents, who ascribed to his misconduct alone the bad

situation of the republic; and above all, the popular affection to the

young prince, which had so long been held in violent constraint, and had

thence acquired new accession of force, began to display itself, and to

threaten the commonwealth with some great convulsion. William III., prince

of Orange, was in the twenty-second year of his age, and gave strong

indications of those great qualities by which his life was afterwards so

much distinguished. De Wit himself, by giving him an excellent education,

and instructing him in all the principles of government and sound policy,

had generously contributed to make his rival formidable. Dreading the

precarious situation of his own party, he was always resolved, he said, by

conveying to the prince the knowledge of affairs, to render him capable of

serving his country, if any future emergence should ever throw the

administration into his hands. The conduct of William had hitherto been

extremely laudable. Notwithstanding his powerful alliances with England

and Brandenburgh, he had expressed his resolution of depending entirely on

the states for his advancement; and the whole tenor of his behavior suited

extremely the genius of that people. Silent and thoughtful given to hear

and to inquire; of a sound and steady understanding; firm in what he once

resolved, or once denied; strongly intent on business, little on pleasure;

by these virtues he engaged the attention of all men And the people,

sensible that they owed their liberty and very existence to his family,

and remembering that his great-uncle Maurice had been able, even in more

early youth, to defend them against the exorbitant power of Spain, were

desirous of raising this prince to all the authority of his ancestors; and

hoped, from his valor and conduct alone, to receive protection against

those imminent dangers with which they were at present threatened.

 

While these two powerful factions struggled for superiority, every scheme

for defence was opposed, every project retarded What was determined with

difficulty, was executed without vigor. Levies, indeed, were made, and the

army completed to seventy thousand men;[*] the prince was appointed both

general and admiral of the commonwealth, and the whole military power was

put into his hands. But new troops could not of a sudden acquire

discipline and experience: and the partisans of the prince were still

unsatisfied, as long as the perpetual edict (so it was called) remained in

force; by which he was excluded from the stadtholdership, and from all

share in the civil administration.

 

It had always been the maxim of De Wit’s party to cultivate naval affairs

with extreme care, and to give the fleet a preference above the army,

which they represented as the object of an unreasonable partiality la the

princes of Orange. The two violent wars which had of late been waged with

England, had exercised the valor and improved the skill of the sailors.

And, above all, De Ruyter, the greatest sea commander of the age, was

closely connected with the Lovestein party; and every one was disposed,

with confidence and alacrity, to obey him. The equipment of the fleet was

therefore hastened by De Wit; in hopes that, by striking at first a

successful blow, he might inspire courage into the dismayed states, and

support his own declining authority. He seems to have been, in a peculiar

manner, incensed against the English; and he resolved to take revenge on

them for their conduct, of which, he thought, he himself and his country

had such reason to complain. By ihe offer of a close alliance for mutual

defence, they had seduced the republic to quit the alliance of France; but

no sooner had she embraced these measures, than they formed leagues for

her destruction, with that very power which they had treacherously engaged

her to offend. In the midst of full peace, nay, during an intimate union,

they attacked her commerce, her only means of subsistence; and, moved by

shameful rapacity, had invaded that property which, from a reliance on

their faith, they had hoped to find unprotected and defenceless. Contrary

to their own manifest interest, as well as to their honor, they still

retained a malignant resentment for her successful conclusion of the

former war; a war which had at first sprung from their own wanton

insolence and ambition. To repress so dangerous an enemy would, De Wit

imagined, give peculiar pleasure, and contribute to the future security of

his country, whose prosperity was so much the object of general envy.

 

Actuated by like motives and views, De Ruyter put to sea with a formidable

fleet, consisting of ninety-one ships of war and forty-four fireships.

Cornelius De Wit was on board, as deputy from the states. They sailed in

quest of the English, who were under the command of the duke of York, and

who had already joined the French under Mareschal D’EtrÃ©es. The combined

fleets lay at Solebay in a very negligent posture, and Sandwich, being an

experienced officer, had given the duke warning of the danger, but

received, it is said, such an answer as intimated that there was more of

caution than of courage in his apprehensions. Upon the appearance of the

enemy, every one ran to his post with precipitation; and many ships were

obliged to cut their cables, in order to be in readiness. Sandwich

commanded the van; and though determined to conquer or to perish, he so

tempered his courage with prudence, that the whole fleet was visibly

indebted to him for its safety. He hastened out of the bay, where it had

been easy for De Ruyter with his fireships to have destroyed the combined

fleets, which were crowded together; and by this wise measure, he gave

time to the duke of York, who commanded the main body, and to Mareschal

D’EtrÃ©es, admiral of the rear, to disengage themselves. He himself

meanwhile rushed into battle with the Hollanders; and by presenting

himself to every danger, had drawn upon him all the bravest of the enemy,

He killed Van Ghent, a Dutch admiral, and beat off his ship: he sunk

another ship, which ventured to lay him aboard: he sunk three fireships,

which endeavored to grapple with him: and though his vessel was torn in

pieces with shot, and of a thousand men she contained, near six hundred

were laid dead upon the deck, he continued still to thunder with all his

artillery in the midst of the enemy. But another fireship, more fortunate

than the preceding, having laid hold of his vessel, her destruction was

now inevitable. Warned by Sir Edward Haddock, his captain, he refused to

make his escape; and bravely embraced death, as a shelter from that

ignominy which a rash expression of the duke’s, he thought, had thrown

upon him.

 

During this fierce engagement with Sandwich, De Ruyter remained not

inactive. He attacked the duke of York, and fought him with such fury for

above two hours, that of two and thirty actions in which that admiral had

been engaged, he declared this combat to be the most obstinately disputed.

The duke’s ship was so shattered, that he was obliged to leave her, and

remove his flag to another. His squadron was overpowered with numbers,

till Sir Joseph Jordan, who had succeeded to Sandwich’s command, came to

his assistance; and the fight, being more equally balanced, was continued

till night, when the Dutch retired, and were not followed by the English.

The loss sustained by the fleets of the two maritime powers was nearly

equal, if it did not rather fall more heavy on the English. The French

suffered very little, because they had scarcely been engaged in the

action; and as this backwardness is not their national character, it was

concluded, that they had received secret orders to spare their ships,

while the Dutch and English should weaken each other by their mutual

animosity. Almost all the other actions during the present war tended to

confirm this suspicion.

 

It might be deemed honorable for the Dutch to have fought with some

advantage the combined fleets of two such powerful nations; but nothing

less than a complete victory could serve the purpose of De Wit, or save

his country from those calamities which from every quarter threatened to

overwhelm her. He had expected, that the French would make their attack on

the side of Maestricht, which was well fortified, and provided with a good

garrison; but Lewis, taking advantage of his alliance with Cologne,

resolved to invade the enemy on that frontier, which he knew to be more

feeble and defenceless. The armies of that elector, and those of Munster,

appeared on the other side of the Rhine, and divided the force and

attention of the states. The Dutch troops, too weak to defend so extensive

a frontier, were scattered into so many towns, that no considerable body

remained in the field and a strong garrison was scarcely to be found in

any fortress Lewis passed the Meuse at Viset; and laying siege to Orsoi, a

town of the elector of Brandenburgh’s, but garrisoned by the Dutch, he

carried it in three days. He divided his army, and invested at once Burik,

Wesel, Emerik, and Rhimberg, four places regularly fortified, and not

unprovided with troops: in a few days, all these places were surrendered.

A general astonishment had seized the Hollanders, from the combination of

such powerful princes against the republic; and nowhere was resistance

made suitable to the ancient glory or present greatness of the state.

Governors without experience commanded troops without discipline; and

despair had universally extinguished that sense of honor, by which alone

men in such dangerous extremities can be animated to a valorous defence.

 

Lewis advanced to the banks of the Rhine, which he prepared to pass. To

all the other calamities of the Dutch was added the extreme drought of the

season, by which the greatest rivers were much diminished, and in some

places rendered fordable. The French cavalry, animated by the presence of

their prince, full of impetuous courage, but ranged in exact order, flung

themselves into the river: the infantry passed in boats: a few regiments

of Dutch appeared on the other side, who were unable to make resistance.

And thus was executed without danger, but not without glory, the passage

of the Rhine so much celebrated at that time by the flattery of the French

courtiers, and transmitted to posterity by the more durable flattery of

their poets.

 

Each success added courage to the conquerors, and struck the vanquished

with dismay. The prince of Orange, though prudent beyond his age, was but

newly advanced to the command, unacquainted with the army, unknown to

them; and all men, by reason of the violent factions which prevailed, were

uncertain of the authority on which they must depend. It was expected that

the fort of Skink, famous for the sieges which it had formerly sustained,

would make some resistance; but it yielded to Turenne in a few days. The

same general made himself master of Arnheim, Knotzembourg, and Nimeguen,

as soon as he appeared before them. Doesbourg at the same time opened its

gates to Lewis: soon after, Harderwic, Amersfort, Campen, Rhenen, Viane,

Elbe g, Zwol. Cuilemberg, Wageninguen, Lochem, Woerden, fe into the

enemy’s hands. Groll and Deventer surrendered to the mareschal Luxembourg,

who commanded the troops of Munster. And every hour brought to the states

news of the rapid progress of the French, and of the cowardly defence of

their own garrisons.

 

The prince of Orange, with his small and discouraged army, retired into

the province of Holland; where he expected, from the natural strength of

the country, since all human art and courage failed, to be able to make

some resistance. The town and province of Utrecht sent deputies, and

surrendered themselves to Lewis Naerden, a place within three leagues of

Amsterdam, was seized by the marquis of Rochfort; and had he pushed on to

Muyden, he had easily gotten possession of it. Fourteen stragglers of his

army having appeared before the gates of that town, the magistrates sent

them the keys; but a servant maid, who was alone in the castle, having

raised the drawbridge, kept them from taking possession of that fortress.

The magistrates afterwards, finding the party so weak, made them drunk,

and took the keys from them. Muyden is so near to Amsterdam, thai its

cannon may infest the ships which enter that city.

 

Lewis with a splendid court made a solemn entry into Utrecht, full of

glory, because every where attended with success; though more owing to the

cowardice and misconduct of his enemies, than to his own valor or

prudence. Three provinces were already in his hands, Guelderland,

Overyssel, and Utrecht; Groninghen was threatened; Friezeland was exposed:

the only difficulty lay in Holland and Zealand; and the monarch

deliberated concerning the proper measures for reducing them. CondÃ© and

Turenne exhorted him to dismantle all the towns which he had taken, except

a few; and fortifying his main army by the garrisons, put himself in a

condition of pushing his conquests. Louvois, hoping that the other

provinces, weak and dismayed, would prove an easy prey, advised him to

keep possession of places which might afterwards serve to retain the

people in subjection. His counsel was followed though it was found, soon

after, to have been the most impolitic.

 

Meanwhile the people throughout the republic, instead of collecting a

noble indignation against the haughty conqueror discharged their rage upon

their own unhappy minister, on whose prudence and integrity every one

formerly bestowed the merited applause. The bad condition of the armies

was laid to his charge: the ill choice of governors was ascribed to his

partiality: as instances of cowardice multiplied, treachery was suspected;

and his former connections with France being remembered, the populace

believed, that he and his partisans had now combined to betray them to

their most mortal enemy. The prince of Orange, notwithstanding his youth

and inexperience, was looked on as the only savior of the state; and men

were violently driven by their fears into his party, to which they had

always been led by favor and inclination.

 

Amsterdam alone seemed to retain some courage; and by forming a regular

plan of defence, endeavored to infuse spirit into the other cities. The

magistrates obliged the burgesses to keep a strict watch: the populace,

whom want of employment might engage to mutiny, were maintained by regular

pay, and armed for the defence of the public. Some ships which lay useless

in the harbor, were refitted, and stationed to guard the city; and the

sluices being opened, the neighboring country, without regard to the

damage sustained, was laid under water. All the province followed the

example, and scrupled not, in this extremity, to restore to the sea those

fertile fields which with great art and expense had been won from it.

 

The states were assembled to consider whether any means were left to save

the remains of their lately flourishing and now distressed commonwealth.

Though they were surrounded with waters, which barred all access to the

enemy, their deliberations were not conducted with that tranquillity which

could alone suggest measures proper to extricate them from their present

difficulties. The nobles gave their vote, that, provided their religion,

liberty, and sovereignty could be saved, every thing else should without

scruple be sacrificed to the conqueror. Eleven towns concurred in the same

sentiments. Amsterdam singly declared against all treaty with insolent and

triumphant enemies: but notwithstanding that opposition, ambassadors were

despatched to implore the pity of the two combined monarchs. It was

resolved to sacrifice to Lewis, Maestricht and all the frontier towns

which lay without the bounds of the seven provinces; and to pay him a

large sum for the charges of the war.

 

Lewis deliberated with his ministers, Louvois and Pomponne, concerning the

measures which he should embrace in the present emergence; and fortunately

for Europe, he still preferred the violent counsels of the former. He

offered to evacuate his conquests, on condition that all duties lately

imposed on the commodities of France should be taken off: that the public

exercise of the Romish religion should be permitted in the United

Provinces; the churches shared with the Catholics; and their priests

maintained by appointments from the states: that all the frontier towns of

the republic should be yielded to him, together with Nimeguen, Skink,

Knotzembourg, and that part of Guelderland which lay on the other side of

the Rhine; as likewise the Isle of Bommel, that of Voorn, the fortress of

St. Andrew, those of Louvestein and Crevecoeur: that the states should pay

him the sum of twenty millions of livres for the charges of the war: that

they should every year send him a solemn embassy, and present him with a

golden medal, as an acknowledgment that they owed to him the preservation

of that liberty which, by the assistance of his predecessors, they had

formerly acquired: and that they should give entire satisfaction to the

king of England: and he allowed them but ten days for the acceptance of

these demands.

 

The ambassadors sent to London met with still worse reception: no minister

was allowed to treat with them; and they were retained in a kind of

confinement. But notwithstanding this rigorous conduct of the court, the

presence of the Dutch ambassadors excited the sentiments of tender

compassion, and even indignation, among the people in general, especially

among those who could foresee the aim and result of those dangerous

counsels. The two most powerful monarchs, they said, in Europe, the one by

land, the other by sea, have, contrary to the faith of solemn treaties,

combined to exterminate an illustrious republic: what a dismal prospect

does their success afford to the neighbors of the one, and to the subjects

of the other? Charles had formed the triple league, in order to restrain

the power of France; a sure proof that he does not now err from ignorance.

He had courted and obtained the applauses of his people by that wise

measure: as he now adopts contrary counsels, he must surely expect by

their means to render himself independent of his people, whose sentiments

are become so indifferent to him. During the entire submission of the

nation, and dutiful behavior of the parliament, dangerous projects,

without provocation, are formed to reduce them to subjection; and all the

foreign interests of the people are sacrificed, in order the more surely

to bereave them of their domestic liberties. Lest any instance of freedom

should remain within their view, the United Province; the real barrier of

England, must be abandoned to the most dangerous enemy of England; and by

a universal combination of tyranny against laws and liberty, all mankind,

who have retained in any degree their precious, though hitherto precarious

birthrights, are forever to submit to slavery and injustice.

 

Though the fear of giving umbrage to his confederate had engaged Charles

to treat the Dutch ambassadors with such rigor, he was not altogether

without uneasiness on account of the rapid and unexpected progress of the

French arms. Were Holland entirely conquered, its whole commerce and naval

force, he perceived, must become an accession to France; the Spanish Low

Countries must soon follow; and Lewis, now independent of his ally, would

no longer think it his interest to support him against his discontented

subjects. Charles, though he never carried his attention to very distant

consequences, could not but foresee these obvious events; and though

incapable of envy or jealousy, he was touched with anxiety, when he found

every thing yield to the French arms, while such vigorous resistance was

made to his own. He soon dismissed the Dutch ambassadors, lest they should

cabal among his subjects, who bore them great favor: but he sent over

Buckingham and Arlington, and soon after Lord Halifax, to negotiate anew

with the French king, in the present prosperous situation of that

monarch’s affairs.

 

These ministers passed through Holland; and as they were supposed to bring

peace to the distressed republic, they were every where received with the

loudest acclamations. “God bless the king of England! God bless the prince

of Orange! Confusion to the states!” This was every where the cry of the

populace. The ambassadors had several conferences with the states and the

prince of Orange; but made no reasonable advances towards an

accommodation. They went to Utrecht where they renewed the league with

Lewis, and agreed, that neither of the kings should make peace with

Holland but by common consent. They next gave in their pretensions, of

which the following are the principal articles: that the Dutch should give

up the honor of the flag, without the least reserve or limitation nor

should whole fleets, even on the coast of Holland, refuse to strike or

lower their topsails to the smallest ship carrying the British flag: that

all persons guilty of treason against the king, or of writing seditious

libels, should, on complaint, be banished forever the dominions of the

states; that the Dutch should pay the king a million sterling towards the

charges of the war, together with ten thousand pounds a year, for

permission to fish on the British seas: that they should share the Indian

trade with the English: that the prince of Orange and his descendants

should enjoy the sovereignty of the United Provinces; at least, that they

should be invested with the dignities of stadtholder, admiral, and

general, in as ample a manner as had ever been enjoyed by any of his

ancestors: and that the Isle of Walcheren, the city and castle of Sluis,

together with the isles of Cadsant, GorÃ©e, and Vorne, should be put into

the king’s hands, as a security for the performance of articles.

 

The terms proposed by Lewis bereaved the republic of all security against

any invasion by land from France: those demanded by Charles exposed them

equally to an invasion by sea from England; and when both were united,

they appeared absolutely intolerable, and reduced the Hollanders, who saw

no means of defence, to the utmost despair. What extremely augmented their

distress, were the violent factions with which they continued to be every

where agitated. De Wit, too pertinacious in defence of his own system of

liberty, while the very being of the commonwealth was threatened, still

persevered in opposing the repeal of the perpetual edict, now become the

object of horror to the Dutch populace. Their rage at last broke all

bounds, and bore every thing before it. They rose in an insurrection at

Dort, and by force constrained their burgomasters to sign the repeal so

much demanded. This proved a signal of a general revolt throughout all the

provinces.

 

At Amsterdam, the Hague, Middlebourg, Rotterdam, the people flew to arms,

and trampling under foot the authority of their magistrates, obliged them

to submit to the prince of Orange. They expelled from their office such as

displeased them: they required the prince to appoint others in their

place; and, agreeably to the proceedings of the populace in all ages,

provided they might wreak their vengeance on their superiors, they

expressed great indifference for the protection of their civil liberties.

 

The superior talents and virtues of De Wit made him on this occasion the

chief object of envy, and exposed him to the utmost rage of popular

prejudice. Four assassins, actuated by no other motive than mistaken zeal,

had assaulted him in the streets; and after giving him many wounds, had

left him for dead. One of them was punished: the others were never

questioned for the crime. His brother Cornelius, who had behaved with

prudence and courage on board the fleet, was obliged by sickness to come

ashore; and he was now confined to his house at Dort. Some assassins broke

in upon him; and it was with the utmost difficulty that his family and

servants could repel their violence. At Amsterdam, the house of the brave

De Ruyter, the sole resource of the distressed commonwealth, was

surrounded by the enraged populace; and his wife and children were for

some time exposed to the most imminent danger.

 

One Tichelaer, a barber, a man noted for infamy, accused Cornelius de Wit

of endeavoring by bribes to engage him in the design of poisoning the

prince of Orange. The accusation, though attended with the most

improbable, and even absurd circumstances, was greedily received by the

credulous multitude; and Cornelius was cited before a court of judicature.

The judges, either blinded by the same prejudices, or not daring to oppose

the popular torrent, condemned him to suffer the question. This man, who

had bravely served his country in war, and who had been invested with the

highest dignities, was delivered into the hands of the executioner, and

torn in pieces by the most inhuman torments. Amidst the severe agonies

which he endured, he still made protestations of his innocence, and

frequently repeated an ode of Horace, which contained sentiments suited to

his deplorable condition:—

 

Justum et tenacem propositi virum, etc.[*]

 

The judges, however, condemned him to lose his offices, and to be banished

the commonwealth. The pensionary, who had not been terrified from

performing the part of a kind brother and faithful friend during this

prosecution, resolved not to desert him on account of the unmerited infamy

which was endeavored to be thrown upon him. He came to his brothers

prison, determined to accompany him to the place of his exile. The signal

was given to the populace. They rose in arms: they broke open the doors of

the prison; they pulled out the two brothers; and a thousand hands vied

who should first be imbrued in their blood. Even their death did not

satiate the brutal rage of the multitude. They exercised on the dead

bodies of those virtuous citizens, indignities too shocking to be recited;

and till tired with their own fury, they permitted not the friends of the

deceased to approach, or to bestow on them the honors of a funeral, silent

and unattended.

 

The massacre of the De Wits put an end for the time to the remains of

their party; and all men, from fear, inclination, or prudence, concurred

in expressing the most implicit obedience to the prince of Orange. The

republic, though half subdued by foreign force, and as yet dismayed by its

misfortunes, was now firmly united under one leader, and began to collect

the remains of its pristine vigor. William, worthy of that heroic family

from which he sprang, adopted sentiments becoming the head of a brave and

free people. He bent all his efforts against the public enemy: he sought

not against his country any advantages which might be dangerous to civil

liberty. Those intolerable conditions demanded by their insolent enemies,

he exhorted the states to reject with scorn; and by his advice they put an

end to negotiations, which served only to break the courage of their

fellow-citizens, and delay the assistance of their allies. He showed them,

that the numbers and riches of the people, aided by the advantages of

situation, would still be sufficient, if they abandoned not themselves to

despair, to resist, at least retard, the progress of their enemies, and

preserve the remaining provinces, till the other nations of Europe,

sensible of the common danger, could come to their relief. He represented

that, as envy at their opulence and liberty had produced this mighty

combination against them they would in vain expect by concessions to

satisfy foes whose pretensions were as little bounded by moderation as by

justice He exhorted them to remember the generous valor of their

ancestors, who, yet in the infancy of the state, preferred liberty to

every human consideration; and rousing their spirits to an obstinate

defence, repelled all the power, riches, and military discipline of Spain.

And he professed himself willing to tread in the steps of his illustrious

predecessors, and hoped, that as they had honored him with the same

affection which their ancestors paid to the former princes of Orange, they

would second his efforts with the same constancy and manly fortitude.

 

The spirit of the young prince infused itself into his hearers. Those who

lately entertained thoughts of yielding their necks to subjection, were

now bravely determined to resist the haughty victor, and to defend those

last remains of their native soil, of which neither the irruptions of

Lewis, nor the inundation of waters, had as yet bereaved them. Should even

the ground fail them on which they might combat, they were still resolved

not to yield the generous strife; but, flying to their settlements in the

Indies, erect a new empire in those remote regions, and preserve alive,

even in the climates of slavery, that liberty of which Europe was become

unworthy. Already they concerted measures for executing this extraordinary

resolution; and found that the vessels contained in their harbors could

transport above two hundred thousand inhabitants to the East Indies.

 

The combined princes, finding at last some appearance of opposition, bent

all their efforts to seduce the prince of Orange, on whose valor and

conduct the fate of the commonwealth entirely depended. The sovereignty of

the province of Holland was offered him, and the protection of England and

France, to insure him, as well against the invasion of foreign enemies, as

the insurrection of his subjects. All proposals were generously rejected;

and the prince declared his resolution to retire into Germany, and to pass

his life in hunting on his lands there, rather than abandon the liberty of

his country, or betray the trust reposed in him. When Buckingham urged the

inevitable destruction which hung over the United Provinces, and asked him

whether he did not see that the commonwealth was ruined, “There is one

certain means,” replied the prince, “by which I can be sure never to see

my country’s ruin: I will die in the last ditch.”

  

The people in Holland had been much incited to espouse the prince’s party,

by the hopes that the king of England pleased with his nephew’s elevation,

would abandon those dangerous engagements into which he had entered, and

would afford his protection to the distressed republic. But all these

hopes were soon found to be fallacious. Charles still persisted in his

alliance with France; and the combined fleets approached the coast of

Holland with an English army on board, commanded by Count Schomberg. It is

pretended that an unusual tide carried them off the coast; and that

Providence thus interposed, in an extraordinary manner, to save the

republic from the imminent danger to which it was exposed. Very

tempestuous weather, it is certain, prevailed all the rest of the season;

and the combined fleets either were blown to a distance, or durst not

approach a coast which might prove fatal to them. Lewis, finding that his

enemies gathered courage behind their inundations, and that no further

success was likely for the present to attend his arms, had retired to

Versailles.

 

The other nations of Europe regarded the subjection of Holland as the

forerunner of their own slavery, and retained no hopes of defending

themselves, should such a mighty accession be made to the already

exorbitant power of France. The emperor, though he lay at a distance, and

was naturally slow in his undertakings, began to put himself in motion;

Brandenburgh showed a disposition to support the states; Spain had sent

some forces to their assistance; and by the present efforts of the prince

of Orange, and the prospect of relief from their allies, a different face

of affairs began already to appear. Groninghen was the first place that

stopped the progress of the enemy: the bishop of Munster was repulsed from

before that town, and obliged to raise the siege with loss and dishonor.

Naerden was attempted by the prince of Orange; but Mareschal Luxembourg,

breaking in upon his intrenchments with a sudden irruption, obliged him to

abandon the enterprise.

 

1673

 

There was no ally on whom the Dutch more relied for assistance, than the

parliament of England, which the king’s necessities at last obliged him to

assemble. The eyes of all men, both abroad and at home, were fixed on this

session, which met after prorogations continued for near two years. It was

evident how much the king dreaded the assembling of his parliament; and

the discontents universally excited by the bold measures entered into,

both in foreign and domestic administration, had given but too just

foundation for his apprehensions.

 

The king, however, in his speech, addressed them with all the appearance

of cordiality and confidence. He said, that he would have assembled them

sooner, had he not been desirous to allow them leisure for attending their

private affairs, as well as to give his people respite from taxes and

impositions: that since their last meeting, he had been forced into a war,

not only just, but necessary; necessary both for the honor and interest of

the nation: that in order to have peace at home, while he had war abroad,

he had issued his declaration of indulgence to dissenters, and had found

many good effects to result from that measure: that he heard of some

exceptions which had been taken to this exercise of power; but he would

tell them plainly, that he was resolved to stick to his declaration, and

would be much offended at any contradiction: and that though a rumor had

been spread, as if the new-levied army had been intended to control law

and property, he regarded that jealousy as so frivolous, that he was

resolved to augment his forces next spring, and did not doubt but they

would consider the necessity of them in their supplies. The rest of the

business he left to the chancellor.

 

The chancellor enlarged on the same topics, and added many extraordinary

positions of his own. He told them, that the Hollanders were the common

enemies of all monarchies, especially that of England, their only

competitor for commerce and naval power, and the sole obstacle to their

views of attaining a universal empire, as extensive as that of ancient

Rome: that, even during their present distress and danger, they were so

intoxicated with these ambitious projects, as to slight all treaty, nay,

to refuse all cessation of hostilities: that the king, in entering on this

war, did no more than prosecute those maxims which had engaged the

parliament to advise and approve of the last; and he might therefore

safely say, that it was their war: that the states being the eternal

enemies of England, both by interest and inclination, the parliament had

wisely judged it necessary to extirpate them, and had laid it down as an

eternal maxim, that “delenda est Carthago,” this hostile government by all

means is to be subverted: and that though the Dutch pretended to have

assurances that the parliament would furnish no supplies to the king, he

was confident that this hope, in which they extremely trusted, would soon

fail them.

 

Before the commons entered upon business, there lay before them an affair,

which discovered, beyond a possibility of doubt, the arbitrary projects of

the king; and the measures taken upon it, proved that the house was not at

present in a disposition to submit to them. It had been the constant,

undisputed practice, ever since the parliament in 1604, for the house, in

case of any vacancy, to issue out writs for new elections; and the

chancellor, who, before that time, had had some precedents in his favor,

had ever afterwards abstained from all exercise of that authority. This

indeed was one of the first steps which the commons had taken in

establishing and guarding their privileges; and nothing could be more

requisite than this precaution, in order to prevent the clandestine

issuing of writs, and to insure a fair and free election. No one but so

desperate a minister as Shaftesbury, who had entered into a regular plan

for reducing the people to subjection, could have entertained thoughts of

breaking in upon a practice so reasonable and so well established, or

could have hoped to succeed in so bold an enterprise. Several members had

taken their seats upon irregular writs issued by the chancellor; but the

house was no sooner assembled, and the speaker placed in the chair, than a

motion was made against them; and the members themselves had the modesty

to withdraw. Their election was declared null; and new writs, in the usual

form, were issued by the speaker.

 

The next step taken by the commons had the appearance of some more

complaisance; but in reality proceeded from the same spirit of liberty and

independence. They entered a resolution, that, in order to supply his

majesty’s extraordinary occasions, (for that was the expression employed,)

they would grant eighteen months’ assessment, at the rate of seventy

thousand pounds a month, amounting in the whole to one million two hundred

and sixty thousand pounds. Though unwilling to come to a violent breach

with the king, they would not express the least approbation of the war;

and they gave him the prospect of this supply, only that they might have

permission to proceed peaceably in the redress of the other grievances of

which they had such reason to complain.

 

No grievance was more alarming, both on account of the secret views from

which it proceeded, and the consequences which might attend it, than the

declaration of indulgence. A remonstrance was immediately framed against

that exercise of prerogative. The king defended his measure. The commons

persisted in their opposition to it; and they represented, that such a

practice, if admitted, might tend to interrupt the free course of the

laws, and alter the legislative power, which had always been acknowledged

to reside in the king and the two houses. All men were in expectation with

regard to the issue of this extraordinary affair. The king seemed engaged

in honor to support his measure; and in order to prevent all opposition,

he had positively declared that he would support it. The commons were

obliged to persevere, not only because it was dishonorable to be foiled,

where they could plead such strong reasons, but also because, if the king

prevailed in his pretensions, an end seemed to be put to all the legal

limitations of the constitution.

 

It is evident, that Charles was now come to that delicate crisis which he

ought at first to have foreseen, when he embraced those desperate

counsels; and his resolutions, in such an event, ought long ago to have

been entirely fixed and determined. Besides his usual guards, he had an

army encamped at Blackheath, under the command of Mareschal Schomberg, a

foreigner; and many of the officers were of the Catholic religion. His

ally, the French king, he might expect, would second him, if force became

requisite for restraining his discontented subjects, and supporting the

measures which, by common consent, they had agreed to pursue. But the king

was startled when he approached so dangerous a precipice as that which lay

before him. Were violence once offered, there could be no return, he saw,

to mutual confidence and trust with his people; the perils attending

foreign succors, especially from so mighty a prince, were sufficiently

apparent; and the success which his own arms had met with in the war, was

not so great as to increase his authority, or terrify the malecontents

from opposition. The desire of power, likewise, which had engaged Charles

in these precipitate measures, had less proceeded, we may observe, from

ambition than from love of ease. Strict limitations of the constitution

rendered the conduct of business complicated and troublesome; and it was

impossible for him, without much contrivance and intrigue, to procure the

money necessary for his pleasures, or even for the regular support of

government. When the prospect, therefore, of such dangerous opposition

presented itself, the same love of ease inclined him to retract what it

seemed so difficult to maintain; and his turn of mind, naturally pliant

and careless, made him find little objection to a measure which a more

haughty prince would have embraced with the utmost reluctance. That he

might yield with the better grace, he asked the opinion of the house of

peers, who advised him to comply with the commons. Accordingly the king

sent for the declaration, and with his own hands broke the seals. The

commons expressed the utmost satisfaction with this measure, and the most

entire duty to his majesty. Charles assured them, that he would willingly

pass any law offered him, which might tend to give them satisfaction in

all their just grievances.

 

Shaftesbury, when he found the king recede at once from so capital a

point, which he had publicly declared his resolution to maintain,

concluded, that all schemes for enlarging royal authority were vanished,

and that Charles was utterly incapable of pursuing such difficult and such

hazardous measures. The parliament, he foresaw, might push their inquiries

into those counsels which were so generally odious; and the king, from the

same facility of disposition, might abandon his ministers to their

vengeance. He resolved, therefore, to make his peace in time with that

party which was likely to predominate, and to atone for all his violences

in favor of monarchy by like violences in opposition to it. Never turn was

more sudden, or less calculated to save appearances. Immediately he

entered into all the cabals of the country party; and discovered to them,

perhaps magnified, the arbitrary designs of the court, in which he himself

had borne so deep a share. He was received with open arms by that party,

who stood in need of so able a leader; and no questions were asked with

regard to his late apostasy. The various factions into which the nation

had been divided, and the many sudden revolutions to which the public had

been exposed, had tended much to debauch the minds of men, and to destroy

the sense of honor and decorum in their public conduct.

 

But the parliament, though satisfied with the king’s compliance, had not

lost all those apprehensions to which the measures of the court had given

so much foundation. A law passed for imposing a test on all who should

enjoy any public office. Besides taking the oaths of allegiance and

supremacy, and receiving the sacrament in the established church, they

were obliged to abjure all belief in the doctrine of transubstantiation.

As the dissenters had seconded the efforts of the commons against the

king’s declaration of indulgence, and seemed resolute to accept of no

toleration in an illegal manner, they had acquired great favor with the

parliament; and a project was adopted to unite the whole Protestant

interest against the common enemy, who now began to appear formidable. A

bill passed the commons for the ease and relief of the Protestant

nonconformists; but met with some difficulties, at least delays, in the

house of peers.

 

The resolution for supply was carried into a law; as a recompense to the

king for his concessions. An act, likewise, of general pardon and

indemnity was passed, which screened the ministers from all further

inquiry. The parliament probably thought, that the best method of

reclaiming the criminals, was to show them that their case was not

desperate. Even the remonstrance which the commons voted of their

grievances, may be regarded as a proof that their anger was, for the time,

somewhat appeased. None of the capital points are there touched on; the

breach of the triple league, the French alliance, or the shutting up of

the exchequer. The sole grievances mentioned are, an arbitrary imposition

on coals for providing convoys, the exercise of martial law, the

quartering and pressing of soldiers: and they prayed that, after the

conclusion of the war, the whole army should be disbanded. The king gave

them a gracious, though an evasive answer. When business was finished, the

two houses adjourned themselves.

 

Though the king had receded from his declaration of indulgence, and

thereby had tacitly relinquished the dispensing power, he was still

resolved, notwithstanding his bad success both at home and abroad, to

persevere in his alliance with France, and in the Dutch war, and

consequently in all those secret views, whatever they were, which depended

on those fatal measures. The money granted by parliament sufficed to equip

a fleet, of which Prince Rupert was declared admiral; for the duke was set

aside by the test. Sir Edward Sprague and the earl of Ossory commanded

under the prince. A French squadron joined them, commanded by d’EtrÃ©es.

The combined fleets set sail towards the coast of Holland, and found the

enemy lying at anchor within the sands at Schonvelt. There is a natural

confusion attending sea fights, even beyond other military transactions;

derived from the precarious operations of winds and tides, as well as from

the smoke and darkness in which every thing is there involved. No wonder,

therefore, that accounts of those battles are apt to contain uncertainties

and contradictions; especially when delivered by writers of the hostile

nations, who take pleasure in exalting the advantages of their own

countrymen, and depressing those of the enemy. All we can say with

certainty of this battle is, that both sides boasted of the victory; and

we may thence infer, that the event was not decisive. The Dutch, being

near home, retired into their harbors. In a week, they were refitted, and

presented themselves again to the combined fleets. A new action ensued,

not more decisive than the foregoing. It was not fought with great

obstinacy on either side; but whether the Dutch or the allies first

retired, seems to be a matter of uncertainty. The loss in the former cf

these actions fell chiefly on the French, whom the English, diffident of

their intentions, took care to place under their own squadrons; and they

thereby exposed them to all the fire of the enemy. There seems not to have

been a ship lost on either side in the second engagement.

 

It was sufficient glory to De Ruyter, that, with a fleet much inferior to

the combined squadrons of France and England, he could fight them without

any notable disadvantage; and it was sufficient victory, that he could

defeat the project of a descent in Zealand, which, had it taken place, had

endangered, in the present circumstances, the total overthrow of the Dutch

commonwealth. Prince Rupert was also suspected not to favor the king’s

projects for subduing Holland, or enlarging his authority at home; and

from these motives he was thought not to have pressed so hard on the

enemy, as his well-known valer gave reason to expect. It is indeed

remarkable, that during this war, though the English with their allies

much overmatched the Hollanders, they were not able to gain any advantage

over them; while in the former war, though often overborne by numbers,

they still exerted themselves with the greatest courage, and always

acquired great renown, sometimes even signal victories. But they were

disgusted at the present measures, which they deemed pernicious to their

country; they were not satisfied in the justice of the quarrel; and they

entertained a perpetual jealousy of their confederates, whom, had they

been permitted, they would, with much more pleasure, have destroyed than

even the enemy themselves.

 

If Prince Rupert was not favorable to the designs of the court, he enjoyed

as little favor from the court, at least from the duke, who, though he

could no longer command the fleet still possessed the chief authority in

the admiralty. The prince complained of a total want of every thing,

powder shot, provisions, beer, and even water; and he went into harbor,

that he might refit his ships, and supply their numerous necessities.

After some weeks, he was refitted; and he again put to sea. The hostile

fleets met at the mouth of the Texel, and fought the last battle, which,

during the course of so many years, these neighboring maritime powers have

disputed with each other. De Ruyter, and under him Tromp, commanded the

Dutch in this action, as in the two former; for the prince of Orange had

reconciled these gallant rivals; and they retained nothing of their former

animosity, except that emulation which made them exert themselves with

more distinguished bravery against the enemies of their country. Brankert

was opposed to d’EtrÃ©es, De Ruyter to Prince Rupert, Tromp to Sprague. It

is to be remarked, that in all actions, these brave admirals last

mentioned had still selected each other as the only antagonists worthy

each other’s valor; and no decisive advantage had as yet been gained by

either of them. They fought in this battle, as if there were no mean

between death and victory.

 

D’EtrÃ©es and all the French squadron, except Rear-Admiral Martel, kept at

a distance; and Brankert, instead of attacking them, bore down to the

assistance of De Ruyter, who was engaged in furious combat with Prince

Rupert. On no occasion did the prince acquire more deserved honor: his

conduct, as well as valor, shone out with signal lustre. Having disengaged

his squadron from the numerous enemies with whom he was every where

surrounded, and having joined Sir John Chichely, his rear-admiral, who had

been separated from him, he made haste to the relief of Sprague, who was

hard pressed by Tromp’s squadron. The Royal Prince, in which Sprague first

engaged, was so disabled, that he was obliged to hoist his flag on board

the St. George; while Tromp was for a like reason obliged to quit his

ship, the Golden Lion, and go on board the Comet. The fight was renewed

with the utmost fury by these valorous rivals, and by the rear-admirals,

their seconds. Ossory, rear-admiral to Sprague, was preparing to board

Tromp, when he saw the St. George terribly torn, and in a manner disabled.

Sprague was leaving her, in order to hoist his flag on board a third ship,

and return to the charge, when a shot, which had passed through the St.

George, took his boat, and sunk her. The admiral was drowned, to the

regret of Tromp himself, who bestowed on his valor the deserved praises.

 

Prince Rupert found affairs in this dangerous situation, and saw most of

the ships in Sprague’s squadron disabled from fight. The engagement,

however, was renewed, and became very close and bloody. The prince threw

the enemy into disorder. To increase it, he sent among them two fireships,

and at the same time made a signal to the French to bear down; which if

they had done, a decisive victory must have ensued. But the prince, when

he saw that they neglected his signal, and observed that most of his ships

were in no condition to keep the sea long, wisely provided for their

safety by making easy sail towards the English coast. The victory in this

battle was as doubtful as in all the actions fought during the present

war.

 

The turn which the affairs of the Hollanders took by land was more

favorable. The prince of Orange besieged and took Naerden; and from this

success gave his country reason to hope for still more prosperous

enterprises. Montecuculi, who commanded the imperialists on the Upper

Rhine, deceived, by the most artful conduct, the vigilance and penetration

of Turenne, and making a sudden march, sat down before Bonne. The prince

of Orange’s conduct was no less masterly; while he eluded all the French

generals, and leaving them behind him, joined his army to that of the

imperialists. Bonne was taken in a few days: several other places in the

electorate of Cologne fell into the hands of the allies; and the

communication being thus cut off between France and the United Provinces,

Lewis was obliged to recall his forces, and to abandon all his conquests

with greater rapidity than he had at first made them. The taking of

Maestricht was the only advantage which he gained this campaign.

 

A congress was opened at Cologne under the mediation of Sweden; but with

small hopes of success. The demands of the two kings were such as must

have reduced the Hollanders to perpetual servitude. In proportion as the

affairs of the states rose, the kings sunk in their demands; but the

states still sunk lower in their offers; and it was found impossible for

the parties ever to agree on any conditions. After the French evacuated

Holland, the congress broke up; and the seizure of Prince William of

Furstenburg by the Imperialists, afforded the French and English a good

pretence for leaving Cologne. The Dutch ambassadors, in their memorials,

expressed all the haughtiness and disdain so natural to a free state,

which had met with such unmerited ill usage.

 

The parliament of England was now assembled, and discovered much greater

symptoms of ill humor than had appeared in the last session. They had seen

for some time a negotiation of marriage carried on between the duke of

York and the archduchess of Inspruc, a Catholic of the Austrian family;

and they had made no opposition. But when that negotiation failed, and the

duke applied to a princess of the house of Modena, then in close alliance

with France, this circumstance, joined to so many other grounds of

discontent, raised the commons into a flame; and they remonstrated with

the greatest zeal against the intended marriage. The king told them, that

their remonstrance came too late, and that the marriage was already agreed

on, and even celebrated by proxy. The commons still insisted; and

proceeding to the examination of the other parts of government, they voted

the standing army a grievance, and declared, that they would grant no more

supply unless it appeared that the Dutch were so obstinate as to refuse

all reasonable conditions of peace. To cut short these disagreeable

attacks, the king resolved to prorogue the parliament; and with that

intention he came unexpectedly to the house of peers, and sent the usher

to summon the commons. It happened that the speaker and the usher nearly

met at the door of the house; but the speaker being within, some of the

members suddenly shut the door, and cried, “To the chair, to the chair;”

 while others cried, “The black rod is at the door.” The speaker was

hurried to the chair; and the following motions were instantly made: That

the alliance with France is a grievance; that the evil counsellors about

the king are a grievance; that the duke of Lauderdale is a grievance, and

not fit to be trusted or employed. There was a general cry, “To the

question, to the question;” but the usher knocking violently at the door,

the speaker leaped from the chair, and the house rose in great confusion.

 

During the interval, Shaftesbury, whose intrigues with the malecontent

party were now become notorious, was dismissed from the office of

chancellor; and the great seal was given to Sir Heneage Finch, by the

title of lord keeper. The test had incapacitated Clifford; and the white

staff was conferred on Sir Thomas Osborne, soon after created earl of

Danby, a minister of abilities, who had risen by his parliamentary

talents. Clifford retired into the country, and soon after died.

The parliament had been prorogued, in order to give the duke leisure to

finish his marriage; but the king’s necessities soon obliged him again to

assemble them; and by some popular acts he paved the way for the session.

But all his efforts were in vain. The disgust of the commons was fixed in

foundations too deep to be easily removed. They began with applications

for a general fast; by which they intimated that the nation was in a very

calamitous condition: they addressed against the king’s guards, which they

represented as dangerous to liberty, and even as illegal, since they never

had yet received the sanction of parliament: they took some steps towards

establishing a new and more rigorous test against Popery: and what chiefly

alarmed the court, they made an attack on the members of the cabal, to

whose pernicious counsels they imputed all their present grievances.

Clifford was dead: Shaftesbury had made his peace with the country party,

and was become their leader: Buckingham was endeavoring to imitate

Shaftesbury; but his intentions were as yet known to very few. A motion

was therefore made in the house of commons for his impeachment: he desired

to be heard at the bar, but expressed himself in so confused and ambiguous

a manner, as gave little satisfaction. He was required to answer precisely

to certain queries which they proposed to him. These regarded all the

articles of misconduct above mentioned; and among the rest, the following

query seems remarkable: “By whose advice was the army brought up to

overawe the debates and resolutions of the house of commons?” This shows

to what length the suspicions of the house were at that time carried.

Buckingham, in all his answers, endeavored to exculpate himself, and to

load Arlington. He succeeded not in the former intention: the commons

voted an address for his removal. But Arlington, who was on many accounts

obnoxious to the house, was attacked. Articles were drawn up against him;

though the impeachment was never prosecuted.

 

The king plainly saw, that he could expect no supply from the commons for

carrying on a war so odious to them. He resolved, therefore, to make a

separate peace with the Dutch on the terms which they had proposed through

the channel of the Spanish ambassador. With a cordiality which, in the

present disposition on both sides, was probably but affected, but which

was obliging, he asked advice of the parliament. The parliament

unanimously concurred, both in thanks for this gracious condescension, and

in their advice for peace. Peace was accordingly concluded. The honor of

the flag was yielded by the Dutch in the most extensive terms: a

regulation of trade was agreed to: all possessions were restored to the

same condition as before the war: the English planters in Surinam were

allowed to remove at pleasure: and the states agreed to pay to the king

the sum of eight hundred thousand patacoons, near three hundred thousand

pounds. Four days after the parliament was prorogued, the peace was

proclaimed in London, to the great joy of the people. Spain had declared,

that she could no longer remain neuter, if hostilities were continued

against Holland; and a sensible decay of trade was foreseen, in case a

rupture should ensue with that kingdom. The prospect of this loss

contributed very much to increase the national aversion to the present

war, and to enliven the joy for its conclusion.

 

There was in the French service a great body of English, to the number of

ten thousand men, who had acquired honor in every action, and had greatly

contributed to the successes of Lewis. These troops, Charles said, he was

bound by treaty not to recall; but he obliged himself to the states by a

secret article not to allow them to be recruited. His partiality to France

prevented a strict execution of this engagement.
