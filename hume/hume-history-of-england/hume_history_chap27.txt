THE death of Henry VII. had been attended with as open and visible a joy

among the people as decency would permit; and the accession and coronation

of his son, Henry VIII., spread universally a declared and unfeigned

satisfaction. Instead of a monarch jealous, severe, and avaricious, who,

in proportion as he advanced in years, was sinking still deeper in those

unpopular vices, a young prince of eighteen had succeeded to the throne,

who, even in the eyes of men of sense, gave promising hopes of his future

conduct, much more in those of the people, always enchanted with novelty,

youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vigor of his person, accompanied

with dexterity in every manly exercise, was further adorned with a

blooming and ruddy countenance, with a lively air, with the appearance of

spirit and activity in all his demeanor.[*] His father, in order to remove

him from the knowledge of public business, had hitherto occupied him

entirely in the pursuits of literature; and the proficiency which he made

gave no bad prognostic of his parts and capacity.[**] Even the vices of

vehemence, ardor, and impatience, to which he was subject, and which

afterwards degenerated into tyranny, were considered only as faults

incident to unguarded youth, which would be corrected when time had

brought him to greater moderation and maturity. And as the contending

titles of York and Lancaster were now at last fully united in his person,

men justly expected, from a prince obnoxious to no party, that

impartiality of administration which had long been unknown in England.

 

These favorable prepossessions of the public were encouraged by the

measures which Henry embraced in the commencement of his reign. His

grandmother, the countess of Richmond and Derby, was still alive; and as

she was a woman much celebrated for prudence and virtue, he wisely showed

great deference to her opinion in the establishment of his new council.

The members were, Warham, archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor; the

earl of Shrewsbury, steward; Lord Herbert, chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel,

master of the wards and constable of the Tower; Sir Edward Poynings,

comptroller; Sir Henry Marney, afterwards Lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,

afterwards Lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of laws; and Sir Henry

Wyat.[*] These men had long been accustomed to business under the late

king, and were the least unpopular of all the ministers employed by that

monarch. But the chief competitors for favor and authority, under the new

king, were the earl of Surrey, treasurer, and Fox, bishop of Winchester,

secretary and privy seal. This prelate, who enjoyed great credit during

all the former reign, had acquired such habits of caution and frugality as

he could not easily lay aside; and he still opposed, by his remonstrances,

those schemes of dissipation and expense, which the youth and passions of

Henry rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a more dexterous courtier;

and though few had borne a greater share in the frugal politics of the

late king, he knew how to conform himself to the humor of his new master;

and no one was so forward in promoting that liberality, pleasure, and

magnificence, which began to prevail under the young monarch.[**] By this

policy, he ingratiated himself with Henry; he made advantage, as well as

the other courtiers, of the lavish disposition of his master; and he

engaged him in such a course of play and idleness as rendered him

negligent of affairs, and willing to intrust the government of the state

entirely into the hands of his ministers. The great treasures amassed by

the late king were gradually dissipated in the giddy expenses of Henry.

One party of pleasure succeeded to another: tilts, tournaments, and

carousals were exhibited with all the magnificence of the age; and as the

present tranquillity of the public permitted the court to indulge itself

in every amusement, serious business was but little attended to. Or, if

the king intermitted the course of his festivity, he chiefly employed

himself in an application to music and literature, which were his favorite

pursuits, and which were well adapted to his genius.

 

He had made such proficiency in the former art, as even to compose some

pieces of church music, which were sung in his chapel.[*] He was initiated

in the elegant learning of the ancients. And though he was so unfortunate

as to be seduced into a study of the barren controversies of the schools,

which were then fashionable, and had chosen Thomas Aquinas for his

favorite author, he still discovered a capacity fitted for more useful and

entertaining knowledge.

 

The frank and careless humor of the king, as it led him to dissipate the

treasures amassed by his father, rendered him negligent in protecting the

instruments whom that prince had employed in his extortions. A

proclamation being issued to encourage complaints, the rage of the people

was let loose on all informers, who had so long exercised an unbounded

tyranny over the nation: [**] they were thrown into prison, condemned to

the pillory, and most of them lost their lives by the violence of the

populace. Empson and Dudley, who were most exposed to public hatred, were

immediately summoned before the council, in order to answer for their

conduct, which had rendered them so obnoxious.

 

Empson made a shrewd apology for himself, as well as for his associate. He

told the council, that so far from his being justly exposed to censure for

his past conduct, his enemies themselves grounded their clamor on actions

which seemed rather to merit reward and approbation: that a strict

execution of law was the crime of which he and Dudley were accused; though

that law had been established by general consent, and though they had

acted in obedience to the king, to whom the administration of justice was

intrusted by the constitution: that it belonged not to them, who were

instruments in the hands of supreme power, to determine what laws were

recent or obsolete, expedient or hurtful; since they were all alike valid,

so long as they remained unrepealed by the legislature: that it was

natural for a licentious populace to murmur against the restraints of

authority; but all wise states had ever made their glory consist in the

just distribution of rewards and punishments, and had annexed the former

to the observance and enforcement of the laws, the latter to their

violation and infraction; and that a sudden overthrow of all government

might be expected where the judges were committed to the mercy of the

criminals, the rulers to that of the subjects.[*]

 

Notwithstanding this defence, Empson and Dudley were sent to the Tower,

and soon after brought to their trial. The strict execution of laws,

however obsolete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a court of

judicature; and it is likely that, even where they had exercised arbitrary

power, the king, as they had acted by the secret commands of his father,

was not willing that their conduct should undergo too severe a scrutiny.

In order, therefore, to gratify the people with the punishment of these

obnoxious ministers crimes very improbable, or indeed absolutely

impossible, were charged upon them: that they had entered into a

conspiracy against the sovereign, and had intended, on the death of the

late king, to have seized by force the administration of government. The

jury were so far moved by popular prejudices, joined to court influence,

as to give a verdict against them; which was afterwards confirmed by a

bill of attainder in parliament,[**] and, at the earnest desire of the

people, was executed by warrant from the king, Thus, in those arbitrary

times, justice was equally violated, whether the king sought power and

riches, or courted popularity.

 

Henry, while he punished the instruments of past tyranny, had yet such a

deference to former engagements as to deliberate, immediately after his

accession, concerning the celebration of his marriage with the infanta

Catharine, to whom he had been affianced during his father’s lifetime. Her

former marriage with his brother, and the inequality of their years were

the chief objections urged; against his espousing her but, on the other

hand, the advantages of her known virtue, modesty, and sweetness of

disposition were insisted on; the affection which she bore to the king;

the large dowry to which she was entitled as princess of Wales; the

interest of cementing a close alliance with Spain; the necessity of

finding some confederate to counterbalance the power of France; the

expediency of fulfilling the engagements of the late king When these

considerations were weighed, they determined the council, though contrary

to the opinion of the primate, to give Henry their advice for celebrating

the marriage. The countess of Richmond, who had concurred in the same

sentiments with the council, died soon after the marriage of her grandson.

 

The popularity of Henry’s government, his undisputed title, his extensive

authority, his large treasures, the tranquillity of his subjects, were

circumstances which rendered his domestic administration easy and

prosperous: the situation of foreign affairs was no less happy and

desirable. Italy continued still, as during the late reign, to be the

centre of all the wars and negotiations of the European princes; and

Henry’s alliance was courted by all parties; at the same time that he was

not engaged by any immediate interest or necessity to take part with any.

Lewis XII. of France, after his conquest of Milan, was the only great

prince that possessed any territory in Italy; and could he have remained

in tranquillity, he was enabled by his situation to prescribe laws to all

the Italian princes and republics, and to hold the balance among them. But

the desire of making a conquest of Naples, to which he had the same title

or pretensions with his predecessor, still engaged him in new enterprises:

andÂ· as he foresaw opposition from Ferdinand, who was connected both by

treaties and affinity with Frederick of Naples, he endeavored by the

offers of interest, to which the ears of that monarch were ever open, to

engage him in an opposite confederacy. He settled with him a plan for the

partition of the kingdom of Naples, and the expulsion of Frederick; a plan

which the politicians of that, age regarded as the most egregious

imprudence in the French monarch, and the greatest perfidy in the Spanish.

Frederick, supported only by subjects who were either discontented with

his government or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable to resist so

powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of his dominions: but he had the

satisfaction to see Naples immediately prove the source of contention

among his enemies. Ferdinand gave secret orders to his general, Gonsalvo,

whom the Spaniards honor with the appellation of the “great captain,” to

attack the armies of France, and make himself master of all the dominions

of Naples. Gonsalvo prevailed in every enterprise, defeated the French in

two pitched battles, and insured to his prince the entire possession of

that kingdom. Lewis, unable to procure redress by force of arms, was

obliged to enter into a fruitless negotiation with Ferdinand for the

recovery of his share of the partition; and all Italy, during some time,

was held in suspense between these two powerful monarchs.

 

There has scarcely been any period when the balance of power was better

secured in Europe, and seemed more able to maintain itself without any

anxious concern or attention of the princes. Several great monarchies were

established; and no one so far surpassed the rest as to give any

foundation or even pretence for jealousy. England was united in domestic

peace, and by its situation happily secured from the invasion of

foreigners. The coalition of the several kingdoms of Spain had formed one

powerful monarchy, which Ferdinand administered with arts, fraudulent

indeed and deceitful, but full of vigor and ability. Lewis XII., a gallant

and generous prince, had, by espousing Anne of Brittany, widow to his

predecessor, preserved the union with that principality, on which the

safety of his kingdom so much depended. Maximilian, the emperor, besides

the hereditary dominions of the Austrian family, maintained authority in

the empire, and, notwithstanding the levity of his character, was able to

unite the German princes in any great plan of interest, at least of

defence. Charles, prince of Castile, grandson to Maximilian and Ferdinand,

had already succeeded to the rich dominions of the house of Burgundy; and

being as yet in early youth, the government was intrusted to Margaret of

Savoy, his aunt, a princess endowed with signal prudence and virtue. The

internal force of these several powerful states, by balancing each other,

might long have maintained general tranquillity, had not the active and

enterprising genius of Julius II., an ambitious pontiff, first excited the

flames of war and discord among them. By his intrigues, a league had been

formed at Cambray,[*] between himself, Maximilian, Lewis, and Ferdinand;

and the object of this great confederacy was to overwhelm, by their united

arms, the commonwealth of Venice.

 

Henry, without any motive from interest or passion, allowed his name to be

inserted in the confederacy. This oppressive and iniquitous league was but

too successful against the republic.

 

The great force and secure situation of the considerable monarchies

prevented any one from aspiring to any conquest of moment; and though this

consideration could not maintain general peace, or remedy the natural

inquietude of men, it rendered the princes of this age more disposed to

desert engagements, and change their alliances, in which they were

retained by humor and caprice, rather than by any natural or durable

interest.

 

1510.

 

Julius had no sooner humbled the Venetian republic, than he was inspired

with a nobler ambition, that of expelling all foreigners from Italy, or,

to speak in the style affected by the Italians of that age, the freeing of

that country entirely from the dominion of barbarians.[*] He was

determined to make the tempest fall first upon Lewis; and in order to pave

the way for this great enterprise, he at once sought for a ground of

quarrel with that monarch, and courted the alliance of other princes. He

declared war against the duke of Ferrara, the confederate of Lewis. He

solicited the favor of England, by sending Henry a sacred rose, perfumed

with musk and anointed with chrism.[**] He engaged in his interests

Bambridge, archbishop of York, and Henry’s ambassador at Rome, whom he

soon after created a cardinal. He drew over Ferdinand to his party, though

that monarch at first made no declaration of his intentions. And what he

chiefly valued, he formed a treaty with the Swiss cantons, who, enraged by

some neglects put upon them by Lewis, accompanied with contumelious

expressions, had quitted the alliance of France, and waited for an

opportunity of revenging themselves on that nation.

 

1511.

 

While the French monarch repelled the attacks of his enemies, he thought

it also requisite to make an attempt on the pope himself, and to despoil

him as much as possible of that sacred character which chiefly rendered

him formidable. He engaged some cardinals, disgusted with the violence of

Julius, to desert him; and by their authority he was determined, in

conjunction with Maximilian, who still adhered to his alliance, to call a

general council, which might reform the church, and check the exorbitances

of the Roman pontiff. A council was summoned at Pisa, which from the

beginning bore a very inauspicious aspect, and promised little success to

had adherents. Except a few French bishops, who unwillingly obeyed the

king’s commands in attending the council, all the other prelates kept

aloof from an assembly which they regarded as the offspring of faction,

intrigue, and worldly politics. Even Pisa, the place of their residence,

showed them signs of contempt; which engaged them to transfer their

session to Milan, a city under the dominion of the French monarch;

Notwithstanding this advantage, they did not experience much more

respectful treatment from the inhabitants of Milan; and found it necessary

to make another remove to Lyons.[*] Lewis himself fortified these violent

prejudices in favor of papal authority, by the symptoms which he

discovered of regard, deference, and submission to Julius, whom he always

spared, even when fortune had thrown into his hands the most inviting

opportunities of humbling him. And as it was known that his consort, who

had great influence over him, was extremely disquieted in mind on account

of his dissensions with the holy father, all men prognosticated to Julius

final success in this unequal contest.

 

The enterprising pontiff knew his advantages, and availed himself of them

with the utmost temerity and insolence. So much had he neglected his

sacerdotal character, that he acted in person at the siege of Mirandola,

visited the trenches, saw some of his attendants killed by his side, and,

like a young soldier, cheerfully bore all the rigors of winter and a

severe season, in pursuit of military glory:[**] yet was he still able to

throw, even on his most moderate opponents, the charge of impiety and

profaneness. He summoned, a council at the Lateran: he put Pisa under an

interdict, and all the places which gave shelter to the schismatical

council: he excommunicated the cardinals and prelates who attended it: he

even pointed his spiritual thunder against the princes who adhered to it:

he freed their subjects from all oaths of allegiance, and gave their

dominions to every one who could take possession of them.

 

Ferdinand of Arragon, who had acquired the surname of Catholic, regarded

the cause of the pope and of religion only as a cover to his ambition and

selfish politics: Henry, naturally sincere and sanguine in his temper, and

the more Ã¨o on account of his youth and inexperience, was moved with a

hearty desire of protecting the pope from the oppression to which he

believed him exposed from the ambitious enterprises of Lewis.

 

1512.

 

Hopes had been given him by Julius, that the title of “most Christian

king,” which had hitherto been annexed to the crown of France, and which

was regarded as its most precious ornament, should, in reward of his

services, be transferred to that of England.[*] Impatient also of

acquiring that distinction in Europe, to which his power and opulence

entitled him, he could not long remain neuter amidst the noise of arms;

and the natural enmity of the English against France, as well as their

ancient claims upon that kingdom, led Henry to join that alliance which

the pope, Spain, and Venice had formed against the French monarch. A

herald was sent to Paris, to exhort Lewis not to wage impious war against

the sovereign pontiff; and when he returned without success, another was

sent to demand the ancient patrimonial provinces, Anjou, Maine, Guienne,

and Normandy. This message was understood to be a declaration of war; and

a parliament, being summoned, readily granted supplies for a purpose so

much favored by the English nation.[**]

 

Buonaviso, an agent of the pope’s at London, had been corrupted by the

court of France, and had previously revealed to Lewis all the measures

which Henry was concerting against him. But this infidelity did the king

inconsiderable prejudice, in comparison of the treachery which he

experienced from the selfish purposes of the ally on whom he chiefly

relied for assistance. Ferdinand, his father-in-law, had so long

persevered in a course of crooked politics, that he began even to value

himself on his dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boast of

those shameful successes. Being told one day, that Lewis, a prince of a

very different character, had complained of his having once cheated him:

“He lies, the drunkard!” said he; “I have cheated him above twenty times.”

This prince considered his close connections with Henry only as the means

which enabled him the better to take advantage of his want of experience.

He advised him not to invade France by the way of Calais, where he himself

should not have it in his power to assist him: he exhorted him rather to

send forces to Fontarabia, whence he could easily make a conquest of

Guienne, a province in which it was imagined the English had still some

adherents. He promised to assist this conquest by the junction of a

Spanish army. And so forward did he seem to promote the interests of his

son-in-law, that he even sent vessels to England, in order to transport

over the forces which Henry had levied for that purpose. The marquis of

Dorset commanded this armament, which consisted of ten thousand men,

mostly infantry; Lord Howard, son of the earl of Surrey, Lord Broke, Lord

Ferrars, and many others of the young gentry and nobility, accompanied him

in this service. All were on fire to distinguish themselves by military

achievements, and to make a conquest of importance for their master. The

secret purpose of Ferdinand, in this unexampled generosity, was suspected

by nobody.

 

The small kingdom of Navarre lies on the frontiers between France and

Spain; and as John d’Albert, the sovereign, was connected by friendship

and alliance with Lewis, the opportunity seemed favorable to Ferdinand,

while the English forces were conjoined with his own, and while all

adherents to the council of Pisa lay under the sentence of

excommunication, to put himself in possession of these dominions. No

sooner, therefore, was Dorset landed in Guipiscoa, than the Spanish

monarch declared his readiness to join him with his forces, to make with

united arms an invasion of France, and to form the siege of Bayonne, which

opened the way into Guienne:[*] but he remarked to the English general how

dangerous it might prove to leave behind them the kingdom of Navarre,

which, being in close alliance with France, could easily give admittance

to the enemy, and cut off all communication between Spain and the combined

armies. To provide against so dangerous an event, he required that John

should stipulate a neutrality in the present war; and when that prince

expressed his willingness to enter into any engagement for that purpose,

he also required that security should be given for the strict observance

of it.

 

John having likewise agreed to this condition, Ferdinand demanded that he

should deliver into his hands six of the most considerable places of his

dominions, together with his eldest son as a hostage. These were not terms

to be proposed to a sovereign; and as the Spanish monarch expected a

refusal, he gave immediate orders to the duke of Alva, his general, to

make an invasion on Navarre, and to reduce that kingdom.

 

Alva soon made himself master of all the smaller towns; and being ready to

form the siege of Pampeluna, the capital, he summoned the marquis of

Dorset to join him with the English army, and concert together all their

operations.

 

Dorset began to suspect that the interests of his master were very little

regarded in all these transactions; and having no orders to invade the

kingdom of Navarre, or make war any where but in France, he refused to

take any part in the enterprise. He remained therefore in his quarters at

Fontarabia; but so subtle was the contrivance of Ferdinand, that even

while the English army lay in that situation, it was almost equally

serviceable to his purpose, as if it had acted in conjunction with his

own. It kept the French army in awe, and prevented it from advancing to

succor the kingdom of Navarre; so that Alva, having full leisure to

conduct the siege, made himself master of Pampeluna, and obliged John to

seek for shelter in France. The Spanish general applied again to Dorset,

and proposed to conduct with united counsels the operations of the “holy

league,” (so it was called,) against Lewis: but as he still declined

forming the siege of Bayonne, and rather insisted on the invasion of the

principality of Bearne, a part of the king of Navarre’s dominions which

lies on the French side of the Pyrenees, Dorset, justly suspicious of his

sinister intentions, represented that, without new orders from his master,

he could not concur in such an undertaking. In order to procure these

orders, Ferdinand despatched Martin de Ampios to London; and persuaded

Henry that, by the refractory and scrupulous humor of the English general,

the most favorable opportunities were lost; and that it was necessary he

should on all occasions act in concert with the Spanish commander, who was

best acquainted with the situation of the country, and the reasons of

every operation. But before orders to this purpose reached Spain, Dorset

had become extremely impatient; and observing that his further stay served

not to promote the main undertaking, and that his army was daily perishing

by want and sickness, he demanded shipping from Ferdinand to transport

them back into England. Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to furnish him

with this supply whenever demanded, was at length, after many delays,

obliged to yield to his importunity; and Dorset, embarking his troops,

prepared himself for the voyage. Meanwhile the messenger arrived with

orders from Henry, that the troops should remain in Spain; but the

soldiers were so discontented with the treatment which they had met with,

that they mutinied, and obliged their commanders to set sail for England.

Henry was much displeased with the ill success of this enterprise; and it

was with difficulty that Dorset, by explaining the fraudulent conduct of

Ferdinand, was at last able to appease him.

 

There happened this summer an action at sea, which brought not any more

decisive advantage to the English. Sir Thomas Knevet, master of horse, was

sent to the coast of Brittany with a fleet of forty-five sail; and he

carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew, and many other young

courtiers, who longed for an opportunity of displaying their valor. After

they had committed some depredations, a French fleet of thirty-nine sail

issued from Brest, under the command of Primauget, and began an engagement

with the English. Fire seized the ship of Primauget; who, finding his

destruction inevitable, bore down upon the vessel of the English admiral,

and grappling with her, resolved to make her share his fate. Both fleets

stood some time in suspense, as spectators of this dreadful engagement;

and all men saw with horror the flames which consumed both vessels, and

heard the cries of fury and despair which came from the miserable

combatants. At last the French vessel blew up; and at the same time

destroyed the English.[*] The rest of the French fleet made their escape

into different harbors.

 

The war which England waged against France, though it brought no advantage

to the former kingdom, was of great prejudice to the latter; and by

obliging Lewis to withdraw his forces for the defence of his own

dominions, lost him that superiority which his arms in the beginning of

the campaign had attained in Italy. Gaston de Foix, his nephew, a young

hero, had been intrusted with the command of the French forces; and in a

few months performed such feats of military art and prowess, as were

sufficient to render illustrious the life of the oldest captain.[**] His

career finished with the great battle of Ravenna, which, after the most

obstinate conflict, he gained over the Spanish and papal armies. He

perished the very moment his victory was complete; and with him perished

the fortune of the French arms in Italy.

 

The Swiss, who had rendered themselves extremely formidable by their bands

of disciplined infantry, invaded the Milanese with a numerous army, and

raised up that inconstant people to a revolt against the dominion of

France. Genoa followed the example of the duchy; and thus Lewis in a few

weeks entirely lost his Italian conquests, except some garrisons; and

Maximilian Sforza, the son of Ludovic, was reinstated in possession of

Milan.

 

1513.

 

Julius discovered extreme joy on the discomfiture of the French; and the

more so as he had been beholden for it to the Swiss, a people whose

councils he hoped he should always be able to influence and govern. The

pontiff survived this success a very little time; and in his place was

chosen John de Medicis, who took the appellation of Leo X., and proved one

of the most illustrious princes that ever sat on the papal throne. Humane,

beneficent, generous, affable; the patron of every art, and friend of

every virtue;[*] he had a soul no less capable of forming great designs

than his predecessor, but was more gentle, pliant, and artful in employing

means for the execution of them. The sole defect, indeed, of his character

was too great finesse and artifice; a fault which, both as a priest and an

Italian, it was difficult for him to avoid. By the negotiations of Leo,

the emperor Maximilian was detached from the French interest; and Henry,

notwithstanding his disappointments in the former campaign, was still

encouraged to prosecute his warlike measures against Lewis.

 

Henry had summoned a new session of parliament,[**] and obtained a supply

for his enterprise. It was a poll-tax, and imposed different sums,

according to the station and riches of the person. A duke paid ten marks,

an earl five pounds, a baron four pounds, a knight four marks; every man

valued at eight hundred pounds in goods, four marks. An imposition was

also granted of two fifteenths and four tenths.[***] By these supplies,

joined to the treasure which had been left by his father, and which was

not yet entirely dissipated, he was enabled to levy a great army, and

render himself formidable to his enemy. The English are said to have been

much encouraged, in this enterprise, by the arrival of a vessel in the

Thames under the papal banner. It carried presents of wine and hams to the

king and the more eminent courtiers; and such fond devotion was at that

time entertained towards the court of Rome, that these trivial presents

were every where received with the greatest triumph and exultation.

 

In order to prevent all disturbances from Scotland while Henry’s arms

should be employed on the continent, Dr. West, dean of Windsor, was

despatched on an embassy to James, the king’s brother-in-law; and

instructions were given him to accommodate all differences between the

kingdoms, as well as to discover the intentions of the court of

Scotland.[*] Some complaints had already been made on both sides. One

Barton, a Scotchman, having suffered injuries from the Portuguese, for

which he could obtain no redress, had procured letters of marque against

that nation; but he had no sooner put to sea than he was guilty of the

grossest abuses, committed depredations upon the English, and much

infested the narrow seas.[**] Lord Howard and Sir Edward Howard, admirals,

and sons of the earl of Surrey, sailing out against him, fought him in a

desperate action, where the pirate was killed; and they brought his ships

into the Thames. As Henry refused all satisfaction for this act of

justice, some of the borderers, who wanted but a pretence for

depredations, entered England under the command of Lord Hume, warden of

the marches, and committed great ravages on that kingdom. Notwithstanding

these mutual grounds of dissatisfaction, matters might easily have been

accommodated, had it not been for Henry’s intended invasion of France,

which roused the jealousy of the Scottish nation.[***]

 

The ancient league which subsisted between France and Scotland was

conceived to be the strongest band of connection; and the Scots

universally believed, that were it not for the countenance which they

received from this foreign alliance, they had never been able so long to

maintain their independence against a people so much superior. James was

further incited to take part in the quarrel by the invitations of Anne,

queen of France, whose knight he had ever in all tournaments professed

himself, and who summoned him, according to the ideas of romantic

gallantry prevalent in that age, to take the field in her defence, and

prove himself her true and valorous champion. The remonstrances of his

consort and of his wisest counsellors were in vain opposed to the martial

ardor of this prince. He first sent a squadron of ships to the assistance

of France; the only fleet which Scotland seems ever to have possessed. And

though he still made professions of maintaining a neutrality, the English

ambassador easily foresaw that a war would in the end prove inevitable;

and he gave warning of the danger to his master, who sent the earl of

Surrey to put the borders in a posture of defence, and to resist the

expected invasion of the enemy.

 

Henry, all on fire for military fame, was little discouraged by this

appearance of a diversion from the north; and so much the less, as he

flattered himself with the assistance of all the considerable potentates

of Europe in his invasion of France. The pope still continued to thunder

out his excommunications against Lewis and all the adherents of the

schismatical council: the Swiss cantons made professions of violent

animosity against France: the ambassadors of Ferdinand and Maximilian had

signed with those of Henry a treaty of alliance against that power, and

had stipulated the time and place of their intended invasion: and though

Ferdinand disavowed his ambassador, and even signed a truce for a

twelvemonth with the common enemy, Henry was not yet fully convinced of

his selfish and sinister intentions, and still hoped for his concurrence

after the expiration of that term. He had now got a minister who complied

with all his inclinations, and flattered him in every scheme to which his

sanguine and impetuous temper was inclined.

 

Thomas Wolsey, dean of Lincoln, and almoner to the king, surpassed in

favor all his ministers, and was fast advancing towards that unrivalled

grandeur which he afterwards attained. This man was son of a butcher at

Ipswich; but having got a learned education, and being endowed with an

excellent capacity, he was admitted into the marquis of Dorset’s family as

tutor to that nobleman’s children, and soon gained the friendship and

countenance of his patron.[*] He was recommended to be chaplain to Henry

VII.; and being employed by that monarch in a secret negotiation, which

regarded his intended marriage with Margaret of Savoy, Maximilian’s

daughter, he acquitted himself to the king’s satisfaction, and obtained

the praise both of diligence and dexterity in his conduct.[**]

 

That prince, having given him a commission to Maximilian, who at that time

resided in Brussels, was surprised, in less than three days after, to see

Wolsey present himself before him, and supposing that he had protracted

his departure, he began to reprove him for the dilatory execution of his

orders. Wolsey informed him that he had just returned from Brussels, and

had successfully fulfilled all his majesty’s commands. “But on second

thoughts,” said the king, “I found that somewhat was omitted in your

orders; and have sent a messenger after you with fuller instructions.” “I

met the messenger,” replied Wolsey, “on my return: but as I had reflected

on that omission, I ventured of myself to execute what I knew must be your

majesty’s intentions.” The death of Henry soon after this incident

retarded the advancement of Wolsey, and prevented his reaping any

advantage from the good opinion which that monarch had entertained of him:

but thence forwards he was looked on at court as a rising man; and Fox,

bishop of Winchester, cast his eye upon him as one who might be

serviceable to him in his present situation.[*] This prelate, observing

that the earl of Surrey had totally eclipsed him in favor, resolved to

introduce Wolsey to the young prince’s familiarity; and hoped that he

might rival Surrey in his insinuating arts, and yet be contented to act in

the cabinet a part subordinate to Fox himself, who had promoted him.

 

In a little time, Wolsey gained so much on the king, that he supplanted

both Surrey in his favor, and Fox in his trust and confidence. Being

admitted to Henry’s parties of pleasure, he took the lead in every jovial

conversation, and promoted all that frolic and entertainment which he

found suitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch. Neither

his own years, which were near forty, nor his character of a clergyman,

were any restraint upon him, or engaged him to check, by any useless

severity, the gayety in which Henry, who had small propension to

debauchery, passed his careless hours. During the intervals of amusement,

he introduced business, and insinuated those maxims of conduct which he

was desirous his master should adopt. He observed to him that while he

intrusted his affairs into the hands of his father’s counsellors, he had

the advantage indeed of employing men of wisdom and experience, but men

who owed not their promotion to his favor, and who scarcely thought

themselves accountable to him for the exercise of their authority: that by

the factions, and cabals, and jealousies which had long prevailed among

them, they more obstructed the advancement of his affairs, than they

promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice had conferred upon

them: that while he thought proper to pass his time in those pleasures to

which his age and royal fortune invited him, and in those studies which

would in time enable him to sway the sceptre with absolute authority, his

best system of government would be, to intrust his authority into the

hands of some one person who was the creature of his will, and who could

entertain no view but that of promoting his service: and that if this

minister had also the same relish for pleasure with himself, and the same

taste for science, he could more easily, at intervals, account to him for

his whole conduct, and introduce his master gradually into the knowledge

of public business; and thus, without tedious constraint or application,

initiate him in the science of government.[*]

 

Henry entered into all the views of Wolsey; and finding no one so capable

of executing this plan of administration as the person who proposed it, he

soon advanced his favorite, from being the companion of his pleasures, to

be a member of his council; and from being a member of his council, to be

his sole and absolute minister. By this rapid advancement and uncontrolled

authority, the character and genius of Wolsey had full opportunity to

display itself. Insatiable in his acquisitions, but still more magnificent

in his expense: of extensive capacity, but still more unbounded

enterprise: ambitious of power, but still more desirous of glory:

insinuating engaging, persuasive; and, by turns, lofty, elevated,

commanding: haughty to his equals, but affable to his dependants:

oppressive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more generous than

grateful; less moved by injuries than by contempt; he was framed to take

the ascendant in every intercourse with others, but exerted this

superiority of nature with such ostentation as exposed him to envy, and

made every one willing to recall the original inferiority, or rather

meanness, of his fortune.

 

The branch of administration in which Henry most exerted himself, while he

gave his entire confidence to Wolsey, was the military; which, as it

suited the natural gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well as the

ardor of his youth, was the principal object of his attention. Finding

that Lewis had made great preparations both by sea and land to resist him,

he was no less careful to levy a formidable army and equip a considerable

fleet for the invasion of France. The command of the fleet was intrusted

to Sir Edward Howard; who, after scouring the Channel for some time,

presented himself before Brest, where the French navy then lay; and he

challenged them to a combat. The French admiral, who expected from the

Mediterranean a reÃ«nforcement of some galleys under the command of

Prejeant de Bidoux, kept within the harbor, and saw with patience the

English burn and destroy the country in the neighborhood. At last Prejeant

arrived with six galleys, and put into Conquet, a place within a few

leagues of Brest; where he secured himself behind some batteries, which he

had planted on rocks that lay on each side of him. Howard was,

notwithstanding, determined to make an attack upon him; and as he had but

two galleys, he took himself the command of one, and gave the other to

Lord Ferrars. He was followed by some row-barges and some crayers under

the command of Sir Thomas Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers

of distinction. He immediately fastened on Prejeant’s ship, and leaped on

board of her, attended by one Carroz, a Spanish cavalier, and seventeen

Englishmen. The cable, meanwhile, which fastened his ship to that of the

enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands of the French;

and as he still continued the combat with great gallantry, he was pushed

overboard by their pikes.[*] Lord Ferrars, seeing the admiral’s galley

fall off, followed with the other small vessels; and the whole fleet was

so discouraged by the loss of their commander, that they retired from

before Brest.[**] The French navy came out of harbor, and even ventured to

invade the coast of Sussex. They were repulsed, and Prejeant, their

commander, lost an eye by the shot of an arrow. Lord Howard, brother to

the deceased admiral, succeeded to the command of the English fleet; and

little memorable passed at sea during this summer.

 

Great preparations had been making at land, during the whole winter, for

an invasion on France by the way of Calais; but the summer was well

advanced before every thing was in sufficient readiness for the intended

enterprise. The long peace which the kingdom had enjoyed had somewhat

unfitted the English for military expeditions; and the great change which

had lately been introduced in the art of war, had rendered it still more

difficult to inure them to the use of the weapons now employed in action.

The Swiss, and after them the Spaniards, had shown the advantage of a

stable infantry, who fought with pike and sword, and were able to repulse

even the heavy-armed cavalry, in which the great force of the armies

formerly consisted. The practice of firearms was become common; though the

caliver, which was the weapon now in use, was so inconvenient, and

attended with so many disadvantages, that it had not entirely discredited

the bow, a weapon in which the English excelled all European nations. A

considerable part of the forces which Henry levied for the invasion of

France consisted of archers; and as soon as affairs were in readiness, the

vanguard of the army, amounting to eight thousand men, under the command

of the earl of Shrewsbury, sailed over to Calais. Shrewsbury was

accompanied by the earl of Derby, the lords Fitzwater, Hastings, Cobham,

and Sir Rice ap Thomas, captain of the light horse. Another body of six

thousand men soon after followed under the command of Lord Herbert the

chamberlain, attended by the earls of Northumberland and Kent, the lords

Audley and Delawar, together with Carew, Curson, and other gentlemen.

 

The king himself prepared to follow with the main body and rear of the

army; and he appointed the queen regent of the kingdom during his absence.

That he might secure her administration from all disturbance, he ordered

Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to be beheaded in the Tower, the

nobleman who had been attainted and imprisoned during the late reign.

Henry was led to commit this act of violence by the dying commands, as is

imagined, of his father, who told him that he never would be free from

danger while a man of so turbulent a disposition as Suffolk was alive. And

as Richard de la Pole, brother of Suffolk, had accepted of a command in

the French service, and foolishly attempted to revive the York faction,

and to instigate them against the present government, he probably by that

means drew more suddenly the King’s vengeance on this unhappy nobleman.

 

At last, Henry, attended by the duke of Buckingham and many others of the

nobility, arrived at Calais, and entered upon his French expedition, from

which he fondly expected so much success and glory.[*] Of all those allies

on whose assistance he relied, the Swiss alone fully performed their

engagements. Being put in motion by a sum of money sent them by Henry, and

incited by their victories obtained in Italy and by their animosity

against France, they were preparing to enter that kingdom with an army of

twenty-five thousand men; and no equal force could be opposed to their

incursion. Maximilian had received an advance of one hundred and twenty

thousand crowns from Henry, and had promised to reÃ«nforce the Swiss with

eight thousand men, but failed in his engagements. That he might make

atonement to the king, he himself appeared in the Low Countries, and

joined the English army with some German and Flemish soldiers, who were

useful in giving an example of discipline to Henry’s new-levied forces.

Observing the disposition of the English monarch to be more bent on glory

than on interest, he enlisted himself in his service, wore the cross of

St. George, and received pay, a hundred crowns a day, as one of his

subjects and captains. But while he exhibited this extraordinary

spectacle, of an emperor of Germany serving under a king of England, he

was treated with the highest respect by Henry, and really directed all the

operations of the English army.

 

Before the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in the camp, the earl of

Shrewsbury and Lord Herbert had formed the siege of Terouane, a town

situated on the frontiers of Picardy; and they began to attack the place

with vigor. Teligni and Crequi commanded in the town, and had a garrison

not exceeding two thousand men; yet made they such stout resistance as

protracted the siege a month; and they at last found themselves more in

danger from want of provisions and ammunition than from the assaults of

the besiegers. Having conveyed intelligence of their situation to Lewis,

who had advanced to Amiens with his army, that prince gave orders to throw

relief into the place. Fontrailles appeared at the head of eight hundred

horsemen, each of whom carried a sack of gunpowder behind him, and two

quarters of bacon. With this small force he made a sudden and unexpected

irruption into the English camp, and, surmounting all resistance, advanced

to the fosse of the town, where each horseman threw down his burden. They

immediately returned at the gallop, and were so fortunate as again to

break through the English and to suffer little or no loss in this

dangerous attempt.[*]

 

But the English had, soon after, full revenge for the insult. Henry had

received intelligence of the approach of the French horse, who had

advanced to protect another incursion of Fontrailles; and he ordered some

troops to pass the Lis, in order to oppose them. The cavalry of France,

though they consisted chiefly of gentlemen, who had behaved with great

gallantry in many desperate actions in Italy, were, on sight of the enemy,

seized with so unaccountable a panic, that they immediately took to

flight, and were pursued by the English. The duke of Longueville, who

commanded the French, Bussi d’Amboise, Clermont, Imbercourt, the chevalier

Bayard, and many other officers of distinction were made prisoners.[**]

This action, or rather rout, is sometimes called the battle of Guinegate,

from the place where it was fought; but more commonly the “battle of

spurs,” because the French that day made more use of their spurs than of

their swords or military weapons.

 

After so considerable an advantage, the king, who was at the head of a

complete army of above fifty thousand men, might have made incursions to

the gates of Paris, and spread confusion and desolation every where. It

gave Lewis great joy when he heard that the English, instead of pushing

their victory, and attacking the dismayed troops of France, returned to

the siege of so inconsiderable a place as Terouane. The governors were

obliged soon after to capitulate; and Henry found his acquisition of so

little moment, though gained at the expense of some blood, and what, in

his present circumstances, was more important, of much valuable time, that

he immediately demolished the fortifications. The anxieties of the French

were again revived with regard to the motions of the English. The Swiss at

the same time had entered Burgundy with a formidable army, and laid siege

to Dijon, which was in no condition to resist them. Ferdinand himself,

though he had made a truce with Lewis, seemed disposed to lay hold of

every advantage which fortune should present to him. Scarcely ever was the

French monarchy in greater danger, or less in a condition to defend itself

against those powerful armies which on every side assailed or threatened

it. Even many of the inhabitants of Paris, who believed themselves exposed

to the rapacity and violence of the enemy, began to dislodge, without

knowing what place could afford them greater security.

 

But Lewis was extricated from his present difficulties by the manifold

blunders of his enemies. The Swiss allowed themselves to be seduced into a

negotiation by Tremoille, governor of Burgundy; and without making inquiry

whether that nobleman had any powers to treat, they accepted of the

conditions which he offered them. Tremoille, who knew that he should be

disavowed by his master, stipulated whatever they were pleased to demand;

and thought himself happy, at the expense of some payments and very large

promises, to get rid of so formidable an enemy.[*]

 

The measures of Henry showed equal ignorance in the art of war with that

of the Swiss in negotiation. Tournay was a great and rich city, which,

though it lay within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged to France, and

afforded the troops of that kingdom a passage into the heart of the

Netherlands. Maximilian, who was desirous of freeing his grandson from so

troublesome a neighbor, advised Henry to lay siege to the place; and the

English monarch, not considering that such an acquisition nowise advanced

his conquests in France, was so imprudent as to follow this interested

counsel. The city of Tournay, by its ancient charters, being exempted from

the burden of a garrison, the burghers, against the remonstrance of their

sovereign, strenuously insisted on maintaining this dangerous privilege;

and they engaged, by themselves, to make a vigorous defence against the

enemy.[**] Their courage failed them when matters came to trial; and after

a few days’ siege, the place was surrendered to the English. The bishop of

Tournay was lately dead; and as a new bishop was already elected by the

chapter, but not installed in his office, the king bestowed the

administration of the see on his favorite Wolsey, and put him in immediate

possession of the revenues, which were considerable.[***]

 

Hearing of the retreat of the Swiss, and observing the season to be far

advanced, he thought proper to return to England; and he carried the

greater part of his army with him. Success had attended him in every

enterprise; and his youthful mind was much elated with this seeming

prosperity, but all men of judgment, comparing the advantages of his

situation with his progress, his expense with his acquisitions, were

convinced that this campaign, so much vaunted, was, in reality, both

ruinous and inglorious to him.[*]

 

The success which, during this summer, had attended Henry’s arms in the

north, was much more decisive. The king of Scotland had assembled the

whole force of his kingdom; and having passed the Tweed with a brave,

though a tumultuary army of above fifty thousand men, he ravaged those

parts of Northumberland which lay nearest that river, and he employed

himself in taking the Castles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other

places of small importance. Lady Ford, being taken prisoner in her castle,

was presented to James, and so gained on the affections of that prince,

that he wasted in pleasure the critical time which, during the absence of

his enemy, he should have employed in pushing his conquests. His troops,

lying in a barren country, where they soon consumed all the provisions,

began to be pinched with hunger; and as the authority of the prince was

feeble, and military discipline during that age extremely relaxed, many of

them had stolen from the camp, and retired homewards. Meanwhile, the earl

of Surrey, having collected a force of twenty-six thousand men, of which

five thousand had been sent over from the king’s army in France, marched

to the defence of the country, and approached the Scots, who lay on some

high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The River Till ran between the

armies, and prevented an engagement: Surrey therefore sent a herald to the

Scottish camp, challenging the enemy to descend into the plain of

Milfield, which lay towards the south; and there, appointing a day for the

combat, to try their valor on equal ground. As he received no satisfactory

answer, he made a feint of marching towards Berwick; as if he intended to

enter Scotland, to lay waste the borders, and cut off the provisions of

the enemy. The Scottish army, in order to prevent his purpose, put

themselves in motion; and having set fire to the huts in which they had

quartered, they descended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of the

smoke, which was blown towards him, and which concealed his movements,

passed the Till with his artillery and vanguard at the bridge of Twisel,

and sent the rest of his army to seek a ford higher up the river.

 

An engagement was now become inevitable, and both sides prepared for it

with tranquillity and order.[*] The English divided their army into two

lines: Lord Howard led the main body of the first line, Sir Edmond Howard

the right wing, Sir Marmaduke Constable the left. The earl of Surrey

himself commanded the main body of the second line, Lord Dacres the right

wing, Sir Edward Stanley the left. The front of the Scots presented three

divisions to the enemy: the middle was led by the king himself; the right

by the earl of Huntley, assisted by Lord Hume; the left by the earls of

Lenox and Argyle. A fourth division under the earl of Bothwell made a body

of reserve. Huntley began the battle, and, after a sharp conflict, put to

flight the left wing of the English, and chased them off the field: but on

returning from the pursuit, he found the whole Scottish army in great

disorder. The division under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the success of

the other wing, had broken their ranks, and, notwithstanding the

remonstrances and entreaties of La Motte, the French ambassador, had

rushed headlong upon the enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head of

his division, received them with great valor, but Dacres, who commanded in

the second line, wheeling about during the action, fell upon their rear,

and put them to the sword without resistance. The division under James and

that under Bothwell, animated by the valor of their leaders, still made

head against the English, and throwing themselves into a circle,

protracted the action, till night separated the combatants. The victory

seemed yet undecided, and the numbers that fell on each side were nearly

equal, amounting to above five thousand men: but the morning discovered

where the advantage lay. The English had lost only persons of small note;

but the flower of the Scottish nobility had fallen in battle, and their

king himself, after the most diligent inquiry, could nowhere be found. In

searching the field, the English met with a dead body which resembled him,

and was arrayed in a similar habit; and they put it in a leaden coffin,

and sent it to London. During some time it was kept unburied; because

James died under sentence of ex-communication, on account of his

confederacy with France, and his opposition to the holy see:[**] but upon

Henry’s application, who pretended that this prince had, in the instant

before his death, discovered signs of repentance, absolution was given

him, and his body was interred.

 

The Scots, however, still asserted that it was not James’s body which was

found on the field of battle, but that of one Elphinston, who had been

arrayed in arms resembling their king’s, in order to divide the attention

of the English, and share the danger with his master. It was believed that

James had been seen crossing the Tweed at Kelso;* and some imagined that

he had been killed by the vassals of Lord Hume, whom that nobleman had

instigated to commit so enormous a crime. But the populace entertained the

opinion that he was still alive, and having secretly gone in pilgrimage to

the Holy Land, would soon return and take possession of the throne. This

fond conceit was long entertained among the Scots.

 

The king of Scotland and most of his chief nobles being slain in the field

of Flouden, (so this battle was called,) an inviting opportunity was

offered to Henry of gaining advantages over that kingdom, perhaps of

reducing it to subjection. But he discovered on this occasion a mind truly

great and generous. When the queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was created

regent during the infancy of her son, applied for peace, he readily

granted it; and took compassion of the helpless condition of his sister

and nephew. The earl of Surrey, who had gained him so great a victory, was

restored to the title of duke of Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his

father for engaging on the side of Richard III.

 

1514.

 

Lord Howard was honored with the title of earl of Surrey. Sir Charles

Brandon, the king’s favorite, whom he had before created Viscount Lisle,

was now raised to the dignity of duke of Suffolk. Wolsey, who was both his

favorite and his minister, was created bishop of Lincoln. Lord Herbert

obtained the title of earl of Worcester; Sir Edward Stanley, that of Lord

Monteagle.

 

Though peace with Scotland gave Henry security on that side, and enabled

him to prosecute in tranquillity his enterprise against France, some other

incidents had happened, which more than counterbalanced this fortunate

event, and served to open his eyes with regard to the rashness of an

undertaking, into which his youth and high fortune had betrayed him.

 

Lewis, fully sensible of the dangerous situation to which his kingdom had

been reduced during the former campaign, was resolved, by every expedient,

to prevent the return of like perils, and to break the confederacy of his

enemies. The pope was nowise disposed to push the French to extremity; and

provided they did not return to take possession of Milan, his interests

rather led him to preserve the balance among the contending parties. He

accepted, therefore, of Lewis’s offer to renounce the council of Lyons;

and he took off the excommunication which his predecessor and himself had

fulminated against that king and his kingdom. Ferdinand was now fast

declining in years, and as he entertained no further ambition than that of

keeping possession of Navarre, which he had subdued by his arms and

policy, he readily hearkened to the proposals of Lewis for prolonging the

truce another year; and he even showed an inclination of forming a more

intimate connection with that monarch. Lewis had dropped hints of his

intention to marry his second daughter, RenÃ©e, either to Charles, prince

of Spain, or his brother Ferdinand, both of them grandsons of the Spanish

monarch; and he declared his resolution of bestowing on her, as her

portion, his claim to the duchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced

these proposals with joy, but also engaged the emperor Maximilian in the

same views, and procured his accession to a treaty which opened so

inviting a prospect of aggrandizing their common grandchildren.

 

When Henry was informed of Ferdinand’s renewal of the truce with Lewis, he

fell into a violent rage, and loudly complained, that his father-in-law

had first, by high promises and professions, engaged him in enmity with

France, and afterwards, without giving him the least warning, had now

again sacrificed his interests to his own selfish purposes, and had left

him exposed alone to all the danger and expense of the war. In proportion

to his easy credulity, and his unsuspecting reliance on Ferdinand, was the

vehemence with which he exclaimed against the treatment which he met with;

and he threatened revenge for this egregious treachery and breach of

faith.[*] But he lost all patience when informed of the other negotiation,

by which Maximilian was also seduced from his alliance, and in which

proposals had been agreed to for the marriage of the prince of Spain with

the daughter of France. Charles, during the lifetime of the late king, had

been affianced to Mary, Henry’s younger sister; and as the prince now

approached the age of puberty, the king had expected the immediate

completion of the marriage, and the honorable settlement of a sister for

whom he had entertained a tender affection. Such a complication,

therefore, of injuries gave him the highest displeasure, and inspired him

with a desire of expressing his disdain towards those who had imposed on

his youth and inexperience, and had abused his too great facility.

 

The duke of Longueville, who had been made prisoner at the battle of

Gumegate, and who was still detained in England, was ready to take

advantage of all these dispositions of Henry, in order to procure a peace,

and even an alliance, which he knew to be passionately desired by his

master. He represented to the king, that Anne, queen of France, being

lately dead, a door was thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend

to the advantage of both kingdoms, and which would serve to terminate

honorably all the differences between them: that she had left Lewis no

male children; and as he had ever entertained a strong desire of having

heirs to the crown, no marriage seemed more suitable to him than that with

the princess of England, whose youth and beauty afforded the most

flattering hopes in that particular: that though the marriage of a

princess of sixteen with a king of fifty-three might seem unsuitable, yet

the other advantages attending the alliance were more than a sufficient

compensation for this inequality; and that Henry, in loosening his

connections with Spain, from which he had never reaped any advantage,

would contract a close affinity with Lewis, a prince who, through his

whole life, had invariably maintained the character of probity and honor.

 

As Henry seemed to hearken to this discourse with willing ears,

Longueville informed his master of the probability which he discovered of

bringing the matter to a happy conclusion; and he received full powers for

negotiating the treaty. The articles were easily adjusted between the

monarchs. Louis agreed that Tournay should remain in the hands of the

English; that Richard de la Pole should be banished to Metz, there to live

on a pension assigned him by Lewis; that Henry should receive payment of a

million of crowns, being the arrears due by treaty to his father and

himself; and that the princess Mary should bring four hundred thousand

crowns as her portion, and enjoy as large a jointure as any queen of

France, even the former, who was heiress of Brittany. The two princes also

agreed on the succors with which they should mutually supply each other,

in case either of them was attacked by an enemy.[*]

 

In consequence of this treaty, Mary was sent over to France with a

splendid retinue; and Lewis met her at Abbeville, where the espousals were

celebrated. He was enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous

accomplishments of the young princess; and being naturally of an amorous

disposition, which his advanced age had not entirely cooled, he was

seduced into such a course of gayety and pleasure, as proved very

unsuitable to his declining state of health.[**]

 

1515.

 

He died in less than three months after the marriage, to the extreme

regret of the French nation, who, sensible of his tender concern for their

welfare, gave him with one voice the honorable appellation of “father of

his people.”

 

Francis, duke of AngoulÃªme, a youth of one and twenty, who had married

Lewis’s eldest daughter, succeeded him on the throne; and, by his

activity, valor, generosity, and other virtues, gave prognostics of a

happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had been extremely struck

with the charms of the English princess; and even during his predecessor’s

lifetime, had paid her such assiduous court, as made some of his friends

apprehend that he had entertained views of gallantry towards her. But

being warned that, by indulging this passion, he might probably exclude

himself from the throne he forbore all further addresses; and even watched

the young dowager with a very careful eye during the first months of her

widowhood. Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, was at that time in the court

of France, the most comely personage of his time, and the most

accomplished in all the exercises which were then thought to befit a

courtier and a soldier. He was Henry’s chief favorite; and that monarch

had even once entertained thoughts of marrying him to his sister, and had

given indulgence to the mutual passion which took place between them. The

queen asked Suffolk, whether he had now the courage, without further

reflection, to espouse her; and she told him that her brother would more

easily forgive him for not asking his consent, than for acting contrary to

his orders. Suffolk declined not so inviting an offer; and their nuptials

were secretly celebrated at Paris. Francis, who was pleased with this

marriage, as it prevented Henry from forming any powerful alliance by

means of his sister,[*] interposed his good offices in appeasing him: and

even Wolsey, having entertained no jealousy of Suffolk, who was content to

participate in the king’s pleasures, and had no ambition to engage in

public business, was active in reconciling the king to his sister and

brother-in-law; and he obtained them permission to return to England
